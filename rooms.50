The Northwest Corner of the Gate-Wall~
   While the ruined city of Osgiliath stretches out to the north 
and west, here upon the narrow catwalks of the Battalion's walls 
a tower of mortar and wood has been constructed. The thick 
wooden boards of its construction offer a sheltered place of 
respite from arrows. Along the north wall usually sits a ladder 
that can be drawn up to bar access to the loft.

The Northeast Corner of the Gate-Wall~
   This enclosed space is walled by smooth. stout granite 
stones. Braziers flank the walls on each side, and are lit once 
the sun sets. Soldiers constantly come through here and scan the 
area with alert eyes. A ladder leads up through the stone 
ceiling. To the south and west, two portals lie, leading out 
onto the walls of the Tower.

A Guard room at the Base of the Tower~
   Built into the southwest guard tower, this granite walled room 
is lit by several bracketed sconces that pierce the gloomy 
interior. A utilitarian space, the room has few niceties, its 
rock walls lined with instruments of defense rather than comfort. 
Along the southwest wall is the beginning of a spiral staircase 
that leads up onto the ramparts, while to the north, the scent of 
hay and leather drifts in through a narrow passageway. 

   The above trap door has been shattered and ruined, hanging 
uselessly in splinters off of its hinges and leaving a gaping 
hole in the ceiling leading upward.

Stables~
   In poor repair, this building already shows signs of its 
intended use as a stable. Low, half-built stone walls run 
alongside the parameter save for the south and west, which back 
against the Tower's gate-wall. Already, wooden slats have 
outlined the location of stalls, tack room and hay lofts, while 
in many places the supplies of a builders trade have been left 
about. The east wall still lacks its wide barn door, while a 
narrow dilapidated passage southwards through the stone leads to 
a decaying guard house at the base of the corner tower.

South of the Gates~
   A wide staircase of blackened stone rises up at the eastern 
edge of this street, leading to a watch tower set upon the 
repaired battlements of the walls of Osgiliath. To the north, 
the street expands as it approaches what once was an intersection 
before the gates of the city, whilst to the south the road 
appears to be blocked completely by rubble. Westward are the 
remnants of a building, its burnt timbers lying amongst the 
fragments of other nearby structures.

Crenellated Tower Overlooking Northern Ithilien~
   Set in the eastern walls of Osgiliath, this repaired 
watchtower provides a sweeping view of the barren, wind-blasted 
terrain of Northern Ithilien. Burnt farms and desolate 
homesteads are visible in the distance, as well as a long road 
stretching out to a distant range of mountains visible upon the 
horizon. A new, solid iron pole rises up from the centre of the 
platform here, a large banner hoisted upon it. Displayed upon 
its dark blue linen in thick golden thread is the Tree of Gondor, 
seven stars placed about it. 
   Shuttered braziers provide light and warmth during the nights.

Tower Battlements Directly Above the Repaired City Gates~
   Fortified and stout, this newly-constructed tower stands as a 
sentinel directly above the repaired city gate, allowing its 
defenders to keep a constant vigil over Ithilien. Beyond the 
thick stone crenellations, far in the distance to the east, the 
black mountains lay, their snow topped peaks forming the 
impenetrable barrier into Mordor. Directly east from the city 
farmlands grow unattended and wild, and beyond them a thick and 
green forest blankets the countryside.

Amid Mounds of Ruined Buildings~
   Running north from the intersection takes one up onto a pile 
of shifted rubble made up of crumbled stone and wood. Everything 
is darkened from soot and scorching and the landscape has a 
surreal feel about it, everything in this area levelled into 
mounds of destruction. Collapsed walls rise up to the west, 
blocking the river which can be heard rushing along somewhere in 
that direction, while to the east there falls a deep pit too 
steep to descend safely. The mounds continue down to the north 
where one eventually finds a traversable path of broken 
cobblestones.

A Path Leading Up Through the Ruined City~
   The path here is rough and sharp edges of stone make the climb 
up out of this valley of destruction difficult, though it becomes 
easier as one rises up to the north.

A Path Through the Ruined City~
   This may once have been a street through the finer parts of 
Osgiliath, but it has now been reduced to no more than broken 
cobblestones and heaps of rubble that invade it from both sides 
of the street. An imposing rise of rubble halts travel to the 
north and east, but there is a gradual descent down towards the 
river to the west.

A Path Descending West to Stairs of Ruined Stone~
   The path descends down to a point close to the river through 
heaps of ruined buildings and collapsed stone, hemming one in 
more and more as they travel west. The river can be heard more 
clearly here, the fresh breeze occasionally finding its way up 
this path and carrying the noise of its steady rush. Finally the 
path ends and there is a rise of large stone block steps set 
above a pile of rubble and boulders. The steps disappear upwards 
through a hole in a new structure of strapped blackened timbers 
forming the underside of an overhanging platform. 
   This entire area of the path is submerged under a great mass 
of water.

A Reinforced Platform Overlooking the Anduin~
   This platform has a breathtaking view of the mighty Anduin 
river that rushes by far below, though a drop off this height 
would be certain peril as debris and sharp stones rise far below 
along the eastern bank. The platform itself comprises strapped 
together blackened hardwood timber, recently set into the remains 
of a collapsed wall, similarly shored up and strengthened. The 
only access to it are large stone blocks forming steps down the 
eastern outside edge of a broken building. The steps below are 
accessed through a reinforced wooden hatch. 
   More logs and ropes have been used to secure another platform 
above this one, accessed up wooden steps set in the south-west 
corner. 
   An archers' area has been extended to the east, offering a 
clearer view of the ruins below and beyond.

Ruined Building Underbelly~
   With the feel of a dark cavern, this sizeable space is 
surrounded on all sides by rough stone walls and partially 
collapsed buildings, except for a small opening to the east that 
leads to an open pit surrounded by rubble. The space extends to 
the south as the cieling becomes lower, forcing one nearly to 
crawl through the bits of broken stone. There are bits of glass 
and wood strewn about the ground, the only remnants of what may 
have once occupied the room.

the dimly lit tunnel, scant torches mounted on the walls 
providing only meager light.

   This area spreads out into a large underground cavern,

the north and west. There is a stench of filth that immediately 
assaults the nostrils upon descending into the cavern, and the 
only discernable breeze of fresh air seems to come from the hole 
in the middle of the cieling. The area would fit a large number 
of individuals and the cieling is several meters high, reinforced 
with long wooden planks. A wooden ladder drops down from the 
hole into the middle of the room.

has filled a gap in Osgiliath's broken east wall.

   The river Anduin rushes past here north to south, carrying a 
strong and steady current. Just to the south the river crashes 
past large fallen masonry and the remnants of the great bridge of

A Path Hugging the Tower Wall~
   The path moves west and east wedged between mounds of broken 
rubble and insurmountable stone to the north and the destroyed 
tower walls to the south. Further east the Anduin beckons with a 
strong roar of rushing water.

Before a Gaping Hole in the Ruins~
   A gaping hole in the northern section of rubble strewn around 
this area gives access to the dingy remains of a street beyond. 
To the southeast a burnt-out tower blocks the skyline with its 
fingers of charred timbers and collapsed walkways. Shadows rule 
during day and night. To the east the path continues moving 
slightly downhill towards the sound of the Anduin river.

In an Archer's Box over the North Wall  ~
   Spartan and effective in design, this overhang is formed of 
stout, aged timbers and wooden planks. A railing helps prevent 
the unwary from falling out, while wooden walls aid in guarding 
the men within. Down below, the north wall of the Tower can be 
made out.

Large Courtyard Before a Manse~
   This expansive courtyard is set out with a mixture of broken 
cobblestones and grit. A wide solid iron barred gate has been 
placed to the east, the rest of the span blocked by high iron 
railings with cruelly spiked tips atop them. On the western edge 
of the courtyard lies a paltry garden leading to a large repaired 
manse, fresher brickwork revealing considerable repair from siege 
damage. On the northern end of the courtyard lies a two-storey 
barracks, while to the south sits a small clearing leading to 
other buildings. Lanterns from the mostly ruined street along 
with others placed near the doors illuminate the courtyard and 
buildings at night. 
   Looking out from the manse, the view is one of desolation, as 
the destroyed homes and towers of the City of Stars lay all 
about. To the northeast a huge collapsed dome can be spied, a 
high tower opposite.

A Comfortable Antechamber ~
   This sizable chamber is decorated with a plain, spartan beauty 
- clearly a room built for defense despite its furnishings. A 
thick, warm rug covers the cold stone of the floor, while 
tapestries bearing scenes of armored men line the walls. The 
eastern wall is dominated by a sizable fireplace, while along the 
northern wall, an arrow slit looks out upon the city of 
Osgiliath, while a stone staircase winds clockwise upwards.

The Lords Personal Chambers~
   Although not great in size, this room is likely the most 
comfortable within the tower. Stationed high above bowshot of 
the walls, rather than a defensible arrow slit, great glass 
windows on the east and north sheds excellent light into the 
room, while a fireplace banishes the darkness at night. The 
floor is of finely sanded wood and the stone walls level and 
stout.

narrow arrow slit overlooks the courtyard and allows light to 
enter during the day. With rugs and tapestries warding from the 
cold, the room is a fairly comfortable residence.

A Guest Chamber~
   The stones upon the floor have been polished so often that 
they are flat and shiny, creating a smooth gray surface to walk 
upon. The stones on the walls are equally shined, though not 
quite as smoothed, giving the walls a bumpy texture. Natural, 
unpainted wood shutters control the amount of light allowed into 
the room upon daylight. A thick, circular, black rug rests in 
the center of the room on the floor, only covering a fraction of 
the floors surface.

the north wall to let in a small slant of light. Upon the stone 
floors a rug has been tossed to help with the cold, upon which 
several beds are situated. Although cramped for the number of 
beds that occupy it, it none the less provides an effective place

A Roughly-dug Tunnel~
   Cramped, dirty and uncomfortable, this tunnel is low enough to 
make most men bow their heads as they traverse through it. The 
walls are of solid earth, occasionally reinforced by timber or 
the shaggy roots of trees, while several oaken timbers and a 
latticework of planks above keeps the low roof from collapsing.

A Rebuilt Stable~
   This large stable was origionally constructed from dark grey
stone. Now just the supports and bottom part of the structure
remain. Fresh repairs are evident as the red brick clashes with
the dark color of the stone. Despite the colors being at odds the
repairs seem to be well done and the bricks set with some skill.
Six stalls reside along the walls; a large open area between them.
At the end of the stable is an area set up for storage of supplies
and equipment. A ladder leads up to the hayloft above while large
double doors lead off to the west.

   This broad pavilion is fashioned entirely of swaths of tanned 
hide, supported by an array of wooden beams that line the eastern

blanket of worn flagstones that serve as the base of the keep's 
foundation. A small parting within the entrance of the pavilion 
leads out onto the overall worksite, through which light pours in 
a steady stream during the day. At night, a series of hung 
lanterns illuminate the area.

walls, ranging from simple streamers to elaborately designed 
linen panels bearing the sigil of the White Tree. Strewn about 
the ground are a number of chests and crates.

armour and bearing weapons, bustle amongst the ragged, hastily 
erected tents that sit upon the earth. Those cluttered around 
the campfires busy themselves with preparing bland looking stew 
in simple cooking pots, or checking their weapons and armour, all 
the while laughing at the amusing stories shared around. The 
camp continues to in its path to both the east and the west.

Shabby, dirt covered tents are interspersed with primitively 
constructed camp fires, around which groups of soldiers are 
clustered, sitting on rocks or roughly cut logs and tucking 
eagerly into portions of food as they laugh and joke in a rather 
subdued, half hearted manner.

steady stream of people passes between the erected tents, almost 
all of whom are dressed in armour and bearing weapons, as they 
hurry off on their errands. The air here is thick with a strange 
combination of camp smells, freshly dug earth, slowly cooking 
meat and a faint hint of oils and metals. The camp itself

Muddy Encampment~
   This area is a little less populated than the majority of the 
encampment, and the absence of tents and lack of soldiers appears 
to be down to the large amount of wood gathered here. Closer 
inspection reveals that much of this wood has been purposefully 
constructed and much of it is already half assembled into wicked 
looking siege engines. In places, burly looking men work on huge 
logs with axes and various other tools, adding to the collection 
of wood gathered upon the muddy floor. The encampment continues 
to the north and south, working its way through the countryside.

   The muddy, cluttered expanse of the encampment continues to 
the north and south here, its passage dotted with the detritus of 
its occupants. Collections of weapons are propped together, 
forming islands of spears, swords and axes amongst the battered 
cloth tents. Many soldiers are gathered here, mostly huddling 
around a small number of camp fires and busying themselves with 
last minute work on weapons and armour, or filling their stomachs 
with roasted meat and stew. The mood here is quite subdued, and 
a sense of anticipation is obviously in the air, as the soldiers 
utter conversations in small groups.

A Muddy Encampment~
   The damp muddy ground is littered with varying footprints of 
both men and beast. Deep ruts from carts and wheelbarrows 
crisscross the camp. Wood planks, covered in the thick mud have 
been set in front of some of the tents show the footprints of 
those who enter and leave the spattered tents. The ramp grows 
higher as each man wheels his barrow up the muddy path.

A Muddy Path~
   A huge mound of damp earth dominates the path. Mud encrusted 
men work with shovels and planks smoothing it down, raising the 
ramp higher. They pack the damp earth tightly. The ramp reaches 
towards the fort growing in height with each inch forward. A 
myrad of sound and smells float to the top of the ramp from the 
busy camp below.

A Watch Tower Along the Path~
   The air here is choked with the smell of campfires, their 
white plumes trailing up into the sky from a hundred different 
spots. The road here travels through one of the more heavily 
defended sections, its inhabitants having constructed a small 
tower to aid in their watch.

A Path Through the Siege Camp~
   The stumps from tree's long ago harvested occasionally stick 
up out of the muddy ground, the grass and shrubs around them 
trampled by the host of men that encircle the Uruk-Hai fort. All 
about are lines of campfires and tents, giant rolling shields, 
mangonels sending away showers of rocks, and crossbowmen keeping 
a watch for unwary opponents. A narrow trench to either side of 
the camp, though passable, makes any attempted counter-assault a 
troublesome event.

A Rise in the Path~
   A small hillock that rises above the rest of the camp at this 
turn in the path plays host to a hastily constructed wooden 
foundation, upon which a sizable war machine has been hoisted. 
Day or night, this post is heavily guarded, with long lines of 
men helping to supply and load the mangonel as works.

A Muddy Encampment~
   All across the muddy camp men busily work the earth. Mud 
covered horses pull heavy carts of stones cleared from the 
rampway and dump them to the far side of the camp. Huge mud 
puddles dot the camp making walking treacherous. The smoke from 
campfires rises above the camp in snake like coils.

A Muddy Encampment~
   Muddy paths lead up to the muck splattered tents. Men wrapped 
in blankets wander back and forth from the tents to the 
cookfires. Arguing and laughing the men eat their fill of the 
roasted game. The camp hums with sounds from the busy and idling 
men.

   Rows of felled trees lay here. Some are stripped of thier 
branches. Some are still bearing their branches and greenery. 
The sounds of busy saws and axes echo across the mud filled 
encampment and mingle with the sounds of noisy men. The smell of 
the freshly cut trees fill the air with a sweet scent and purging 
the air of the foul odor of the raw sewage.

A Path Winding Through the Siege Camp~
   Built upon the rise of dirt excavated from the trenches to 
either side, this narrow patch of land bears the weight of 
numerous men, bearing the sigils of their lords. Winged helms 
are in evidence, while men with halberds on their shoulders keep 
sentry atop the rough cut logs that guard the busy camp. To 
either side of the muddy path that circles the distant fortress, 
are a number of tents of all sizes, cook-fires and pots visible 
before them, where men crouch and warm themselves in the chill 
air.

A Line of Latrines off the Beaten Path~
   Less heavily occupied than other sections of the ring, this 
sharp turn along the corner of the camp reeks of the sickly sweet 
scent of human sweat and fouler, putrid smell of the nearby 
trench latrines. A muddy path, often tread, winds past the line 
of distant slit-trenches and carries on around the circle.

refuse pile.

The Battalion Aid Station~
   This wood planked guard tower looks out over the battlefield 
with an easy view. A wide stairway, nearly a ramp, leads down 
however, limiting its use for defense. Instead, the place seems 
to have been outfitted as an aid station, with a number of beds 
set atop the wooden floor.

A Broad Hallway~
   This hallway runs ends to the south in a set of heavy, 
iron-braced wooden doors. The floor is bare stone and brick, 
recently constructed judging by the mortar scuffs and timber 
shoring still in place. Torches flicker softly from painted wall 
mountings, keeping the hallway lit at all hours. The dull grey 
walls are plastered as is the low ceiling. This is obviously a 
new extension to the remainder of this complex.

Valley Between Blasted Buildings~
   The area here is held by an almost complete silence, the only 
sounds being those made of any trespassers scraping their way 
across the precariously-resting stones. Here and there amongst 
the rubble lies the odd, weather-stained item: a child's toy, 
bits of now colorless cloth, and charred wood. It makes for 
rough going, struggling past the large boulders and massive 
chunks of stone. East and west lie the skeletal remains of 
buildings, while northwards the rough path moves on.

A Menacingly Silent Turn in the Path~
   Perhaps having once followed a road, there is a low point in 
the rubble here that forms a rather ragged, struggling path. To 
the north and west tall buildings have crumbled, the piles of 
rubble taller than a man and blocking progress in that direction. 
Eastwards the path turns, any travelers forced to take a rather 
rambling path to avoid large boulders and pieces of broken stone. 
The walkable bit of the trail is rather narrow, a man or two but 
no more being able to walk abreast.

   A recent fire has swept through this area, leaving charred 
fragments and collapsed stonework in its wake. Nothing save 
blackened sections of the floor remain. In all directions save 
west the way is blocked by destroyed edifices, now grimly silent 
as they stand testimony to what is now Osgiliath. The entire 
backlot is covered in soot and debris, collapsed walls and 
fire-scorched thick timbers.

Inside A Dust-Ridden, Claustrophobic Tunnel~
   The tight confines of this tunnel force any would-be travelers 
almost surely onto their belly as they worm their way past the 
rough walls of the passage. The makeshift tunnel is far from 
straight--worming this way and that, through small rises and 
dips, and frequently attacking any occupants inside with small 
falling stones, streams of dirt, and pointed pieces of refuse. 
Even breathing in this environment is a dangerous affair, the air 
ahead and behind turned a misty gray from dust.

A Web-Covered Basement~
   The rather choked tunnel from above halts abruptly, some five 
feet from the floor of the area. Perhaps the basement of some 
long-forgotten building, massive spider webs have overrun the 
area in thick, ropy strands. To the touch they are utterly 
adhesive, clustering primarily in the corners and along the 
ceiling. Dangling from the ceiling by wrist-width strands of web 
are several large cocoons, taller than your average man and a 
seemingly pure shade of white. A macabre silence pervades the 
area, this basement having acquired the foreboding quiet of the 
grave. To the east, the basement narrows into a narrow 
passageway.

A Passageway Thick With Massive Webs~
   The stone passageway here is thin and narrow, granting passage 
to perhaps two abreast at a time were the way unobstructed. 
However, along the walls and ceiling here are massive, pure-white 
strands of web--if one seeked to avoid brushing against these, 
one would move ahead in single-file. A smatter of bones lay 
haphazardly on the ground here, recognizable amongst them several 
of seemingly human origin. To those of keen hearing, a faint 
clicking and scraping can be heard from the southern way.

A Semi-Circular Nest of Spidersilk~
   The stone floor here is carpeted with a thick layer of 
webbing, the material sticking to the feet of any unwary 
traveler. The adhesive substance slows walking but still permits 
it inside this semicircular room, a circular staircase in the 
middle of the room leading downwards. Spaced unevenly about the 
room are clusters of large, white orbs. From within them comes 
the sound of soft scratching, clacking--several about the area 
have been cracked open, their tops rent and the inside exposed. 
Inside this room the soft clacking and clatter of massive things 
moving silently is often heard, seeming to emnante from the dark 
staircase below.

A Forsaken Intersection~
   A set of spiral, stone-hewn stairs descend from the ceiling 
into the area, carved from a single large pillar. The once 
finely-cut accuracy of the stairs has been dulled by the passage 
of time and by the tenacious hold of the white webbing which 
coates this entire area--the stairs, the ceiling, the walls. 
From this central axion, darkness stretches to all points of the 
compass: north, south, east, and west remain open. From each 
direction an ominous clattering sounds and even the most 
bland-minded should have a sense of apprehension.

A Sac-Filled Chamber~
   This once square-shaped chamber is now more ovicular than any 
other shape, the sharp edges and corners of the room occupied by 
a thick layer of sticky spidersilk. The floor of the room is 
slightly sticky--adhesive enough to slow down walking without 
halting it. Spaced randomly, and frequently, throughout the room 
are large, circular sacs. They show no respect towards gravity 
as they have been placed on the ceiling, the walls, the floor, 
and in corners. Rising roughly to the waist of the average man, 
a faint clicking sound can be heard from inside as if some hungry 
thing were restrained. Southwards lies darkness and a swelling 
of the eerie clacking.

save rusted iron hinges left. In various piles about the floor 
are wooden remains, collapsed by either rotting time or some 
violence visited upon the room. The remnants of shelves, 
cabinets, and pantries can be seen scattered along this rather 
thin, lengthy room as it leads from east to west. The 
omnipresent webbing is along the floor and walls here, covering 
even the debris. Towards the eastern end of the area lies a 
markedly larger pile of debris.

A Spectral Bedchamber~
   Progressing deeper into the forgotten, corrupted complex this 
room seems to have once been a rather opulent bedchamber. 
Entering this room one must walk through an empty doorframe, the 
door itself long-since broken or rotted away. In the midst of 
the room lays a delipidated bed, the thick webs that are 
ever-present hanging from the ruined canopy. Ancient, desolate 
blankets and pillows still remain atop the bed, immaculately 
folded despite being covered in a thick layer of dust.

Above a Web-Marred Chasm~
   The smooth stone floor here ends abruptly, the thick white 
webbing continuing on, and even strengthening, into the dark 
chasm below. Rent by some event passed in antiquity, the floor 
here is separated by the continuance of the floor across the 
southern way by a gap of some twenty feet. The white webbing 
spills over the edge as if some torrent, thickening as it moves 
down the chasm wall as the man-laid stone gives way to solid 
earth. The webbing's strands are thick and freakishly large, 
each one the size of a man's wrist. One agile enough could 
probably climb down without too much trouble, due to the rough 
manner in which the two sides of the chasm 
separated--outcroppings of earth and stone are frequent as well 
as the inherently adhesive nature of the webbing.

Amongst Desolate Storage~
   The stairs leading down into this rather dank subcellar lead 
only about halfway to the floor, forcing any would-be trespassers 
to jump the last three feet down and then climb back up to 
escape. Any progress atop the wooden stairs would be rickety at 
best, the wood seeming weak and quavering with any too-heavy 
steps. The floor here is shrouded in ankle-deep water, yet 
curiously devoid of the webbing. Floating amongst the black 
water, and sunk beneath it, are several odd bits of debris: 
Pieces of wood, bits of iron hinges, and other items corroded 
beyond use. Towards the northern end of the room a small stone 
pedestal rises.

Garden Drive Before a Manse~
   This long drive is paved in dark grey stone which splits into a
circle. An old marble fountain with a broken statue in its middle
resides in the center of the circle along with a garden surrounding
it, both overrun with weeds. More weed-choked gardens skirt the
edges of the circular drive. The drive leads up to a large mansion
which has obviously been through heavy repair as the worn older
portions are made of stone and the repaired areas consisting of red
brick. Black iron bars rise up vertically over the large windows. On
the second floor a balcony with a marble guard rail can be seen with
portions of gargoyle like statues keeping their ever watchful gaze
on the grounds below.

A Ruined Cratered Common Room~
   This large area consists of several smaller chambers that have 
had their walls knocked out, leaving a single expansive room. 
Swaths of red brick stand out vividly against the darker stone of 
the walls. The southern wall is home to a large black marble 
hearth and fireplace. The remains of a staircase straggle upward 
in the southwest corner of the room, before terminating abruptly 
at a gaping hole, testament to an upper floor that now lies in 
ruin. The northern section of the room holds a long wooden 
table. Beyond it, an oak door that leads to the infirmary. A 
similar oak door sits in the center of the western wall. Three 
large windows, one shattered, look out through iron bars to the 
overgrown gardens. Double oak doors, reinforced with iron bands, 
open up to the drive and courtyard beyond. Underfoot, large 
rugs, thoroughly grimed and stained with a dense layer of dust, 
cover a good portion of the floor, with scarred, gray stones 
visible between them.

Large Storage Room~
   This expansive room has seen the least of the repairs out of the
whole building. Red bricks only speckle the dark grey stone here and
there. The main portion of the repairs seems to be on the ceiling.
Shelves line the walls. Two large windows on the western wall look
out upon the ruins of Osgiliath. A large boulder rests partly sunken
in the ground almost within arms reach of the windows.

A Recently Converted Infirmary~
   The golden oak framed door from the south leads into a bright 
spacious infirmary. The floor is made of a dark wood smoothed to 
a good finish, but the pathways of common travel are polished to 
a higher sheen from the tread of years of footsteps. In the 
center of the room is an old oaken table, scarred here and there 
but still servicable. On the north a large window lets in light, 
affording the room a cheery air. The age darkened oak of the 
walls has been revarnished recently, lending a small hint of 
construction to the atmosphere. Along the north wall a large 
wash basin sits, with several stone topped work tables positioned 
on the west and south walls. The east wall is home to a large 
cupboard and a set of shelves for storing various tools, 
implements, jars and bottles. In the northeast corner there are 
a set of dark stone steps leading down into a cellar. A faint 
yet pungent odor lingers in the air at all times.

A Large, Dark Cellar~
   A flight of ancient grey stone steps lead into this room, the
center of the steps worn down with a hollow from the centuries of
use. The walls of the cellar are made of dark grey stone, and it
appears the cellar was carved out of the rock. Small rustlings in
the darkness hint that perhaps there are some rodent denziens in
this cellar. The walls are lined with bins and shelves made of
roughly smoothed wood, and there are two isles of yet more bins
and shelves dividing the center of the room into thirds. On the
west wall can also be seen some ancient wine racks with some dusty
bottles housed within.

Comfortable Sitting Room~
   Stairs rise up into this large sitting room which has seen recent
repair. Red bricks replace dark grey stone here and there. Probably
once having been a couple of rooms and a hallway it has now been
gutted and opened up. A center fireplace has been built in the room,
red brick rising up as the chimney. Double doors lead out to the
balcony while a sturdy oak door sits in the western wall leading to
an office.

   This balcony is constructed of dark marble which has seen better
days. No repairs have been made here. The balcony remains sturdy
although the expertly carved guardrails are cracked here and there.
Gargoyle like statues line the rails, many destroyed in one way or
another although none are completely missing. They sit watching over
the drive below. A set of double doors opens out onto the balcony,
a sitting room on the other side.

Office of Dark Stone~
   This large office has been set up for more than one person. Dark
stone which has seen recent repair makes up the walls and floors of
the room. Large windows sit in the western wall and look out into the
ruins of Osgiliath. A fireplace rests between the two windows. Two
desks sit in the room, one to the north and the other to the south.
Beyond each desk is a sturdy oak door leading into rooms beyond. A
large bookshelf rests against the eastern wall.

Large Bedroom~
   This large bedroom has seen much recent repair. Fresh mortar
being the main sign that walls have been repaired as dark grey
stone from the rubble was used. The eastern wall is home to a
large stone hearth and fireplace. Also set in the eastern wall is
a set of stone shelves that have been carved into the stone. Wall
lamps hang in various locations to provide enough light to see by.
A table and chairs sits in the middle of the room. An oak door in
the center of the southern wall leads into the office beyond.

Large Bedroom~
   Recent repairs have skillfully been made to this room. Looking
to have been almost completely destroyed previously, the northern
and eastern walls are still made of dark grey stone. The rest of
the room is set with red bricks. A fireplace rests in the eastern
wall with a stone mantle above. Shelves flank the fireplace and
although in good condition look to be old enough to of made it
through the siege. A window looks west over the ruins of Osgiliath
and another south towards what used to be the docks. An oak door
in the center of the north wall gives access to an office.

Broad Living Area~
   This large room has seen heavy repairs. Dark grey stone 
quickly changes over to red bricks. The floor is smooth and worn 
although some scrapes stand out against the lightly polished 
stone. An oak door in the south wall leads out to the manse 
courtyard. Three more doors reside in each of the other walls. 
To the west are the trainer barracks and to the east are bunks 
for recruits, while to the north the smells of food sometimes 
wafts out. A soldier stands here ready for you to "#6hear#0" the

West Barracks~
   Red brick is intermixed with dark grey stone to make up this 
moderately sized and recently repaired room. Wooden bunks flank 
the walls, leaving a path between them which leads to a fireplace 
of dark stone that has been set in the western wall in order to 
provide warmth. An oak door in the east wall leads out to the 
commons. A set of stone steps lead up to another room.

eastern wall has been completely rebuilt with red brick save for 
a fireplace constructed of dark grey stone, most likely the 
remains of the old wall. Otherwise this room seems to have 
needed little work. Bunk beds are lined up along the north and 
south walls of the room. An oak door in the western door leads 
out into the main living area.

Large Kitchen~
   This large kitchen seems to be equipped for large amounts of 
cooking. A fireplace rests along the western wall with a 
permanent spit across it. Not too far off from the fireplace 
rests a large stove. The northern wall contains a large brick 
oven. Shelves line the walls to the sides of the oven and most 
of the eastern wall save for where the pantry sits. Red brick 
comprises much of the northern wall. A large dark grey stone 
counter rests in the center of the room for baking and cooking. 
   A cold storeroom is set through an open doorway in the western 
wall.

A Small Cleared Area of Ground~
   This decaying, miserable patch of ground has seen attempts to 
clear the rubble and decay of the city, with a level of top soil 
tipped over an area about the size of a large tent. To the 
northwest a manse can be seen, with an outlying building to the 
north beyond a dilapidated gravel courtyard and fountain. 
Southwards the armory and warehouse for this military base sit 
against high walls enclosing this area, while westwards a 
palisade stretches across the path and blocks the way, except for 
a small gate at the southern end. The smell of hay and horses 
eastwards suggest a stables.

Southwards the armory and warehouse for this military base sit 
against high walls enclosing this area, while westwards a small 
paddock of sorts and training area can be seen. The smell of hay 
and horses eastwards suggest a stables. 
   At night, this area is unusually chilled and the flittering of 
bats can be heard overhead. Cries from the city of rats and owls 
echo dully in this place. Sometimes a strange light can be seen 
in several of the ruined buildings to the far west of the manse 
complex.

bordering the edge of the manse complex. A wide double door

A Muddy Path Between Buildings~
   Pale grass mixed with weeds stretches from the northern 
bricked wall of the manse, over to the south where piles of 
rubble are stacked. It seems a considerable amount of digging 
has been done here, with small piles of freshly turned earth in 
several places to either side of the path. Some partially burnt 
timbers can be seen too, though its not apparent if it the result 
of something recent or a long forgotten fire. To the south the 
high brick wall of the warehouse blocks further passage. 
Westwards a larger cleared area leads to a covered training yard. 
   A large palisade stretches across the eastern section of the 
path, blocking the way except for a small gate leading on. A 
platform has been raised for archers about four feet above the 
ground.

Weed-Strewn Clearing Amid the Ruins~
   Thick yellowing grass mixed with weeds stretches from the 
northern bricked wall to the south where piles of rubble are 
stacked. The small mounds of recently turned earth indicate some 
sort of digging. As the path leads westwards, it passes through 
a gap in the wall where a gate used to hang. On either side of 
the path a sturdy log structure has been built, supporting a 
hastily-constructed canvas roof. The view westwards above the 
makeshift roofing is one of destruction, with high walls 
shattered and dwellings now mere shells, huge piles of rubble and 
wreckage forming the perimeter of the manse outbuildings. 
   Two small isolated log buildings, are set on either side of 
the cleared area, with iron-bound doors hinting at their purpose.

Poorly Covered Gated Area Bordered by Rubble~
   A series of oak posts line the edge of this expansive 
dirt-packed area. The ground near the wall and gate seems to be 
covered with splinters and small pieces of broken wood, which are 
pressed into the hard packed ground by a multitude of boot 
prints. The vast damage of past fires and broken buildings or 
walls have been moved aside to clear a space west of the patched 
wooden gate. A wooden wall to the south indicates similar signs 
of makeshift repairs. Lashed-together sections of tarpaulin are 
linked across the oaken posts overhead to form a poorly 
constructed roof, barely protecting those within from the wind 
and rain. Sections of the dirt floor are raised by wooden 
platform, upon which equipment is stored.

Inside a Cacophonous Schism~
   Any travelers here are forced to cling to the walls, the 
perilous task eased by periodic outcroppings of stone and the 
thick, sticky white webbing that coates the chasm. The webbing 
is adhesive without being restrictive, slowing movements without 
halting them and still allowing progress. From the darkness 
below, a loud clamour rises up--the high-pitched, foreboding 
sound of chittering and clacking. Above, the lip of the chasm 
can be seen, while the drop below seems to be of a deadly 
distance.

Base of the Spider-Marred Rift~
   The immediate area here lies at the base of a a schism in the 
earth, the stone and dirt having been rent into two opposing 
sides by some cataclysm long forgotten. The sharp edges and 
outcroppings of stone are dulled by thick layers of adhesive 
webbing, as it stretches high into the above darkness. The 
current area is much the same--bear, unworked stone walls with a 
pallid chill hanging about the area. The area is stained white 
with monstrously large spider webbing, this naturally occurring 
room a vaguely bottle-shaped phenomenon. As the small cavern 
progresses northwards, the way narrows until only two could walk 
abreast. The constant chittering rises in volume from the 
northern way, becoming almost painfully grating.

Amongst a Stalagmite Forest~
   The area here is difficult to travel through, the way barred 
by a massive number of stalagmites as they rise from the floor 
like gargantuan, stone teeth. They rise in a tree-esque fashion, 
forcing any travelers to enter and shift amongst them, making any 
group cohesion difficult. To further annoy any would-be 
trespassers, thick webs have been strung between the stalagmites 
in several places as if to bar the way northwards. The webs here 
are are adhesive with an almost animalistic malignancy--Any 
appendages that are forsaken enough to be caught in one are held 
with a torturous tenacity.

Ledge above the Anduin at the Edge of East Osgiliath~
   Even though the winds sweep across this shattered remnant of a 
once great roof, the platform of limestone and iron supports 
feels surprisingly stable. A huge column below, upon which this 
rests, sits right at the edge of the river, set to the northern 
side of the location of the old bridge. Once holding a strip of 
rooftop that sheltered those approaching the Great Bridge's own 
collonade, now all that remains is enough space for about ten 
people to stand together in a narrow line. Stretching westwards 
are more columns, although many have collapsed into the river or 
each other. 
   Eastwards, the remains of the fortress jut out, a jarring rim 
of stone reaching towards this lonely place. To the west, the 
dominoed remains of the river crossing stretch out of sight.

Above the Anduin Nearing East Osgiliath~
   A wide section of roofing remains, as two pillars still stand 
proudly to either side of the Bel-iant Bridge, carrying an area 
of jagged stonework. Southwards the erstwhile platform 
continues. The view from here is both wondrous and terrifying, 
with ruins and sunken debris vying with the thundering Anduin and 
sheer scale of destruction.

Stretching Over the Anduin~
   Stretching northwards away from here, a narrow section of the 
old bridge collonade roof remains, offering a view below of the 
drowned remains once called the Great Bridge. Birds fly nearby 
and some settle on out-poking iron supports, now rusty and 
twisted. 
   Below, a large cargo ship has crashed side-on into the wrecked 
bridge supports, or was holed here deliberately. It lays on its 
port side, masts, ropes and crowsnests offering an easy climb 
down as the stern of the vessel las directly below and a great 
mast has been trapped against the pillar just underfoot.

hang down into the Anduin, sloshing and swinging against the flow

climbing the rigging is to head westwards along hundreds of feet

hundreds of feet. To the east is the stern, with masts collapsed

better days can the scale of destruction be seen. A great ship 
has been holed and lays sideways across a long stretch of the 
river eastwards. All around great pillars and small sections of 
remaining bridge push out like tombs. Westwards, what remains of 
the Great Bridge is close, perhaps only fifty feet to exposed 
floors and jutting ironwork. 
   The platform can be carefully scaled downward from here.

Standing here as the wind blows and the smell of the river drifts 
by, it is no more than rubble. Huge limestone shattered blocks, 
granite and marble engravings, huge rounded boulders. It is a 
place where much was shattered below.
   A large hole in the wreckage leads down a long shaft below. It
looks steep and dangerous below.

Atop the Tunnel at the Bridge's Centre~
   Comprised of newly placed granite rock-work, this tower stands 
atop a recently constructed stone tunnel. Gusts of wind whip 
through the hastily placed crenellations edging the tower, the 
stone fortifications partially blocking a view of the wide river 
below. Several yawning murder holes open in the floor of the 
tower, the granite fashioned to allow easy firing on any trapped 
in the tunnel down below. 
   A wooden tower stands at nearly the same height to the east, 
though clear sight of the occupants is blocked by a thick wooden 
wall. A set of wooden stairs descend over the top of the to the 
west, leading to the bridge.

A Side Passage to the Murder Tunnel~
   Reinforced beams support the sides of this passageway, the 
braces thrust up against the outer stonework of the murder 
tunnel. Horizontal slits between the granite blocks allow 
observers in the passage to provide overwatch on occupants in the 
murder tunnel. Metal window slit covers have been chained

At the Entrance of a Roughly-Dug Tunnel~
   This end of the tunnel is vaguely ovicular-shaped, ballooning 
around the remains of the western wall. Scattered bits of rock, 
bones, and scree crunch under the feet of any travelers through 
this area, echoing maddeningly down the long stone tunnel leading 
eastwards. The constant scuttle of rats is heard about the area, 
their small claws clattering over the stone. The eastern tunnel 
stretches out into black oblivion, the western way seeming to 
widen.

   A massive amount of echoes blasts through these tunnels, 
resounding and multiplying with each new sound, driving any 
paranoid travelers nigh insane with the sounds that seem to come 
from all around them--Before, behind, and surrounded. The tunnel 
progresses east and west in a vaguely swaying direction, the line 
of it holding to that vague direction but certainly not in a 
straight line.

Traveling a Jagged Tunnel~
   The tunnel here is very roughly hewn, the obvious goal being 
expedite progress through the hard rock rather than subtlety or 
style. The edges are jagged, catching on any loose cloth and 
frequently grinding against any armor any travelers might wear. 
The floor of the tunnel is jagged and uneven making progress 
along it a rather awkward affair. The darkness, if no light is 
brought, is absolute.

Above a Cave-In~
   The somewhat, if not smooth then reliable, progress of the 
tunnel suddenly comes to a grinding halt--A part of the path here 
has collapsed into the darkness below. The stone here has caved 
in beneath the weight of the oppressive stone and past travel, a 
thick blackness opening below. Any loose stones kicked or nudge 
below fall for some three or four seconds before landing with a 
quiet splash. For one nimble enough, and aptly geared, the side 
of the cave-in looks possibly climbable.

darkness--and the inky blackness of whatever light is in the area 
reflecting off of a vast water source. The climb down is not 
masterfully difficult, the jagged edges of the shearing providing 
foot and toe holds. From below, soft sounds of splashing rise 
quite frequently.

In A Vast, Dark Lake~
   The jagged wall to the western side of this massive lake leads 
down into the dark, unknowable depths of this lake, leaving any 
travelers floating atop it. The silent is foreboding and thick, 
each quiet water droplet resounding through the enormous area, as 
well as each small splash that emanates from the darkness. The 
darkness is huge, monstrous both above and below--any light shone 
from this area reveals no land in any direction save straight 
back up. Water leads in the other three directions, but one 
sharp of eye could, perhaps, make out a slim glimmer of strangely 
green light to the north.

Swimming on the Surface of a Black Lake~
   The large wall of rock to the west is a constant, just the 
same as the seemingly sky-sized darkness surrounding any 
travelers is. The effect of that much darkness, of that much 
openness, that much foreboding mystery, has a shrinking, 
diminishing effect on any trespassers, bringing to mind their 
fears and paranoia. A faint, shimmering green glow emanates some 
distance to the north as the icy water encloses you.

Bathed in Phosphorescent Glow~
   The edge of the gargantuan, listless lake begins to slowly 
slope upwards to the north and, as it does so, a faint green glow 
begins to thicken and become more constant. It rolls over the 
surface of the eerily-still water in a rather disturbing fashion 
until one nears the shore. The walls are covered with a moss 
that glows a fierce, bright green, bathing the area in its 
strange illumination.

Inside Shadowy Depths~
   The water here is completely clear to the eye, as far as 
whatever light source has been maintained is still lit. At the 
boundaries of that light, however, the darkness wars, seeming to 
want to creep in and extinguish both the light and this invasive 
life. The bottom of the lake is nowhere to be seen, the icy 
water surrounding.

Deep Beneath the Surface~
   The surface is long lost from sight this deep in the 
oppressive lake, your sense of direction estranged from the lack

confused in the utter darkness, the threat of swimming deeper 
when one wished the sanctuary of oxygen a very real threat, to 
even those with light.

seeking to drag them below. The massive darkness surrounding any

through the lake and move towards the center of it. With the 
travel eastwards, the faint sounds of splashing seem to increase 
and an odd scraping sound can be heard occasionally.

   An island of black stone rises in the middle of this titanic 
chamber and lake, the ascent to its mid-point slow and gradual, 
the water retreating from the stone inch by slow inch until any 
travelers are standing atop the platform. The water is eerie in 
its lack of movement and the stillness. The island itself is 
home to little more than some rocky scree.

constant. A faint, green glow can be seen emanating from the 
northern way, while it seems that the ground begins to rise 
heading southwards.

area is awash with it, the time- and water-worn stone smoothed 
and revealed by the light. It washes over the water in a rather 
disconcerting manner.

miscellaneous objects.

At the Base of a Cave-In~
   The underground, prodigiously-sized lake stops abruptly at a 
roughened, jagged wall of stone to the east. A green glow pulses 
to the west while, to the south, the water continues on just as 
endlessly. The northern bank, however, seems to receede a bit 
deeper in that direction even as the water shallows with this 
recession. A number of tunnels seem to branch off, all smooth 
and naturally-formed, seem to branch off in that direction. To 
one with even moderate skill, the eastern side of the cave-in 
would be climable.

An Abruptly-Halted Tunnel~
   The tunnel here, roughly-hewn and dug out of the hard rock, is 
abruptly interrupted by the loss of its being to the below 
blackness. Apparently at some point in the tunnel's 
construction, a long stretch of it has fallen away and collapsed 
into whatever shadows lay beneath. The tunnel itself is of 
definite crude construction with protrusions of stone and the 
floor being a rather rolling, uneven affair. To the east, it 
stretches on.

Amongst Stalactmites~
   In this section of the lake, broad stalactites are present, 
jutting through the air like hungry teeth. Despite this 
appearance of razor-sharpness and savagery, they have been dulled 
by the passage of time and the slow drip of water from the 
ceiling, lost far above in the darkness. The ground beneath the 
feet of any trespassers here would be relatively solid, without 
moss or lichen present.

Nearing the Eastern Shore~
   Despite the vastness of the underground lake, its limits are

are rapidly approaching the eastern shore, the rock beneath their 
feet slanting upwards towards the edges. The rock is smooth, any 
roughness or jagged protrusions worn away by the constant 
presence of the water.

Upon a Gradual Rise~
   The path that the jagged stone tunnel has taken has acquired a 
discernible lilt, rising gently, but steadily, towards the 
surface. The tunnels here are narrow, constrinctly so, large 
enough for only one, or two thin, person to move abreast. 
Navagating this tunnel in those tight confines, with the jagged 
outcroppings of stone and the rough flooring would prove to be a 
tricky affair for almost any would-be traveler.

   The path continues to rise to the east, descending to the west 
in its rugged, but still vaguely linear, path. About midway 
through the air, a rope hangs down from the ceiling through a 
small hole cut into the stone. The end of it is tied into a knot 
and it seems, as best as can be told, to lead straight up into

The Beginning of a Roughly-Hewn Tunnel~
   The tunnel here ends sharply, leading upwards with a series of 
very crudely-crafted, miniscule stone steps--more like foot and 
handholds through the dirt. The entrance to the tunnel is rather 
well-disguised and easily concealed behind a thicket of 
undergrowth and dead leaves. Occasionally, the sounds from above 
will echo in--leaves rustling, a breeze, or the sound of some 
creature moving through the stand of trees. 
   The tunnel has collapsed sometime not too long ago, an 
inpenetrable wall of rubble blocking progress.

   This wide, low raft comprises dozens of birch logs strapped 
together, balanced and strapped onto a dozen small boats, keeping 
it safe from the strongest Anduin surge. Hastily prepared planks 
form a delicate fence around the edges of the vessel, with either 
end open for entry and exit. Two tall lumber posts are mounted 
on each side of the ferry, iron hoops passing through thick 
shiprope stretching across the length of the river. Large enough 
for thirty humanoids standing, the ferry travels slowly but 
steadily. #5OOC: Use "travel west" or "travel east" to move the 
ferry then WAIT.#0

A Hasty Infirmary~
   The rough mortar floor of this dilapidated stone building is 
covered with line after line of hastily placed cots and piles of 
hay. The air carries a mix of the acrid coppery smell of blood, 
rough stench of bile and the clinical odor herbs. A stack of 
medical supplies and crates has been piled in one side of the 
room, near a location marked for triage. The building's windows 
have been boarded up, though iron braziers light the space in an 
an orange glow. 
   Occasionally, wounded soldiers cry out while busy medical 
staff bustle from one patient to the next.

A Battle-Marked Street~
   Between the hulking remains of destroyed buildings, the bodies 
of man and snaga lay slumped in the cobbled street, their bodies 
pierced by arrows or hewn by other weapons. Some corpses lay 
huddled behind defended barricades, the rockwork positions tossd 
to one side of the road by a great force. Rivulets of black and 
red blood pool between the stones of the road.

The Remains of a Fiercely Defended Position~
   The carnage evident from the fierce fighting that happened 
here is spectacular. Here and there, man and orc remain locked 
in death-grips with one another, the grimaces at the time of 
their dying still frozen on their face. Arrows cover the corpses 
of others, mixed with the burnt and singed remains of fighting 
positions. The stench of blood permeates the air around the 
bodies.

A Battle Scarred Street~
   The miscellaneous litter of a battle covers this street, with 
corpses from both orc and man crumpled amid the stone and timber 
wreckage of buildings. Piles of rock and battle refuse are 
strewn about and signs of looting are evident among the remains. 
The cobbles of the street are slick with blood and oil and an 
acrid stench hangs in the air. Parts of the still-standing hulks 
of buildings have been blackened by a searing heat.

A Collapsed Building~
   The block foundation and stonework corners are all that 
remains of this collapsed building. Rubble lay in a deep pile in 
the middle of the carcass of the structure, charred timbers 
rising out of the destruction like the ribs of an animal. The 
odor of char and decay carries from the ruin and ash and detritus 
cover every surface.

On Top Of A Damaged Stone Roof~
   This flat stone roof is scattered with bits of dirt and 
rubble, at one time likely well swept and accessed by a stairwell 
on the now collapsed southeastern side. The west and north open 
up over a street and alley, to the east the great walls of 
Osgiliath can be seen and west, on a clear day, the great white 
city of Minas Tirith. 
   Looking off the eastern edge one can see the streets just to 
the east of the broken gate, while looking down off the north 
edge one can see the streets filled with palisades and trenches, 
both locations set to allow the cauldrons to empty their terrible 
contents upon them.

A Bleak Rooftop Among The Ruins~
   This flat rooftop was likely a pleasant place to enjoy the 
breezes rising from the river and admire the beauty of once- 
grand Osgiliath but is now a grim testament to the ruins of 
warfare. Scattered with dirt, rubble and ash, it provides an 
unpleasant view of the devestation of Osgiliath. The nortwest 
corner is collapsed into rubble, but the north and northeast 
sides are still strong and stable, giving a few of the streets 
and alleys below.

In The Air Over The Street~
   The hard stone ground beneath is a painful twenty or more feet

open space and, perhaps, just enough time to consider what a poor

A Stretch Of Trenches And Palisades~
   This stretch of what was once Rath Gil has been blackened and 
torn asunder. The shattered remains of a stone wall lies to the 
east, torn metal hinges of what was likely a stout iron gate ae 
set into it. Just past the gate however the cobblestones have 
been torn asunder and trenches dug, spaced with palisades. 
Debris of all sort clog the space between making the travel slow 
and tretcherous. The stench of dead clings to this area, burnt 
flesh and rotting meat almost overpowering.

the main room. It's similarly made to the main room, with stone
walls and a closely-fitted stone floor. Light comes from lamps
set around the walls. The door leads back out.

   This small grey stone closet is large enough for a few 
people to stand in comfortably. Intended for storage, it is set 
with shelves and racks, but otherwise it is totally undecorated 
or ornamented.

South End of The Armory~
   Lines of racks cover the walls in this long, dimly-lit room. 
While less traveled than the northern part of the armoury, this 
area is no less maintained. Each shelf has been kept in an 
orderly manner, everything neatly stacked and catalogued. The 
orange glow of glass lamps offer a frosted, dim light. The rows 
of shelving continue towards the north towards the other half of 
the storeroom.

shelves, dimly light by the sparse illumination of glass lamps. 
Stacks of neatly ordered arms and armour lay in bins beneath the 
shelving, with other weaponry hanging from a few racks in the 
corner. This half of the storeroom is well traveled and well 
maintained, with little dust and dirt visible on the floors. A 
long row of shelving continues to the west, towards the other 
half of the storeroom.

Ruins of a Warehouse~
   Sections of a vaulted ceiling hang precariously overhead this 
cavernous ruined warehouse, almost the height of two men above. 
In the center of the shattered building, a thick granite column 
sprouts from the blackened and twisted pine floorboards. Rubble 
is everywhere, walls collapsed in all directions except to the 
north through a crushed doorframe and to the south where a door 
is still set in place. An entire railed balcony has collapsed in 
the southern half of the room. Not enough remains of the ceiling 
or roof of this building to stop the elements. Plants grow on 
the rubble and water has no barrier from flooding in during 
downpours.

Remains of a Dormitory~
   Cedar panels, now streaked and stained, make up the buckled 
walls of this moderately-sized sleeping quarter. Stripped of 
equipment, this is a cold and darkened room. A curved staircase 
is set into the northeastern corner of the room, though it ends 
in rubble as the collapsed roof bars any further progress. The 
northern doorway is set in place, as is a doorway to the south. 
A shattered trapdoor is set into the south-eastern corner of the 
panelled floor.

   A large extension to the wrecked warehouse sits here, serving 
in the past as a simple workroom. Various shelves and cupboards 
line the eastern and southern walls, bordered by the length of a 
large forge that dominates the room's western side. The walls 
themselves are fashioned of grey stone, as is the domed ceiling. 
A cedar-panelled floor runs underfoot and is relatively 
untouched. The southern wall is rubble, with no access in that 
direction. A series of sconzed lanterns provide illumination.

Base Room for the Underground Orc Archer Caves~
This is the base room for the series of underground cave systems as dug out by orcs and held out to slow down the advance of the Battalions.

Below are orcs that have been mcopied a lot, as they are transported over by an rprog called by mob 50018 the Trigger orc when they are below 90% health.

mob 50016 is a Sentinel Orc, with a bow ready.

mob 50017 is a wanderer with a longsword and shield.

mob 50018 is the trigger orc. When the trigger is dead the rprog they stand next to isn't triggered anymore. Kill them and you stop the reinforcements.

They are in scalemail as otherwise they'd die in about two seconds.

A Covered Archer Nest~
   Hidden well under cover of trees and brush, a crescent shaped 
flat dirt area has been cleared of undergrowth to reveal tree 
root and rich soil. Ivy climbs the large oak tree at the back of 
this space and heavy branches creak overhead, joining with the 
voices of the forest. The clearing is perhaps twelve feet in 
length and six wide, though more can gather around it if they 
trample the flora. Set into the ground between tree roots, a 
small flimsy hatch sits, strapped together with ivy and frayed 
rope.

   This fortified tower is roughly ten feet in length and width, 
the crenellated battlements reaching up to the shoulders of a 
man. Set in the direct centre of it is a towering, rusty flag 
post, atop of it flying the tattered remains of the regal blue 
and gold banner of the city of Osgiliath. A short distance to 
the north can be seen another tower. A commanding view of the 
countryside of Anorien can be seen from here, as can the swiftly 
flowing River Anduin that cuts through the ruins from the north 
to south.

As your sight moves northwards along the island you see structures clinging to the steep smooth cliffs, many colorful banners and many armaments adorning each.

To the east, a walled township nears, with large gates and soldiers watching from above. As the carriage nears, the gates swing open and you are delivered into Amdir. Taken out of the carriage by shouting officers, you are all lined up and taken through a gate, up a short northern path, and to an eastern door. Through there you are escorted into a large mess hall, handed a package of equipment, and left there. This is the Amdir Army mess hall. A Corporal or higher will swear you.

Looking Out Over the Palisade~
   The western section of the wide palisade offers a low platform 
from which archers can draw their bows and stare eastward to the 
outlying ruins beyond. A ladder leaning nearby offers a quick 
route back to the city streets below.

North Upper Barracks - Westside~
   Dark grey stone comprises the majority of these barracks, 
seemingly newer than the rest of the building, like the room 
downstairs. Otherwise this room seems to have needed little 
work. Bunk beds are lined up along the west and east walls of 
the room. A doorway offers access to the larger, southern 
barracks.

On the Deck of the Ship~
   This ship possesses a single mast on which have been rigged white 
fore-and-aft sails. The ship's length is over thirty feet with a 
ten foot beam. In addition to the sails, two sets of oars have 
been strapped to the deck. The vessel appears to be in good 
shape, a fresh coat of paint on the hull, and looks quite fast.
