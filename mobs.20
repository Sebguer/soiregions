a swarm of flies~
A swarm of flies buzz about, attacking everything in sight.~
   This swarm of flies hangs about the area, angrily buzzing and 
swooping down to attack everything in sight. There are hundreds 
of black flies in this swarm, varying in size and shape but 
typically repugnant, hairy, and red-eyed.
