a dervish mini-fort-archer~
A dervish mini-fort-archer is here.~
   Haradrim blood clearly flows through the veins of this 
soldier, impassive as they patrol about here, gazing intently at 
their surroundings and going about their duty with a cool and 
precise manner. Far from at ease in their environment, this 
Haradaic warrior jerks their head to every noise or motion that 
falls under their notice, determined that nothing get the better 
of them or catch them unaware. The soldier is clad in light
leathers, suitable for archery or scouting.

Nardu xMiniFort;~
a Nardu warrior~
A Nardu warrior waits here.~
   This wild-featured human looks somewhat cleaner and healthier 
than their exterior facade of savagery would suggest, indicating 
that they have not been long a warrior or long from the tight 
grasp of civilisation. Nevertheless, their eyes are feral, some 
of their teeth sharpened to points, and hair greasy, and such a 
fine point of difference seems insignificant compared to their 
wantonness for bloodshed. They are clothed head to toe in a set 
of light leather armour, allowing them to serve as an archer or 
scout as needs be.

auto-create orc sentinel enforcer prototype khagdu~
a formless orc sentinel khagdu member~
A formless orc sentinel khagdu cultist is here, being spooky.~
   This half-orc looks to lead a particularly miserable existen, 
beaten and starved to the point of gautness. They are covered in 
dozens of ritual scars all over their body, although most of 
these are concealed beneath the rotting leathers they cloth 
themselves in.

auto-create orc sentinel enforcer prototype khagdu~
a formless orc sentinel khagdu member~
A formless orc sentinel khagdu cultist is here, being spooky.~
   This orc holds themselves in a proud, near haughty manner, 
shoulders set back and head straight as they stand here firmly, 
gazing about with two fierce eyes. Apart from their near 
remarkable discipline for one of their race, the most noticeable 
thing about this orc are the countless scars covering its body, 
thin, pale, raised lumps of flesh that contrast starkly with dark 
skin. When this orc's dark lips are drawn back, a missing 
eyetooth becomes apparent. This orc is covered from head to toe 
in a greasy ringmail that is decorated with all manner of bones 
and teeth.

Ticckrrr snaga cringy little xGOTHAKRAOSTLERx~
a cringy little snaga~
A little snaga cringes here.~
   Face seemingly always twisted into a cringe, this snaga seems 
to have endured several strokes within his lifetime. His gangly 
frame draws him a stature that is small even for one of his kin. 
His eyes are narrow drawn and possess a milky film over them. 
Evidence of bites and rends mark his forearms and hands in the 
form of long-healed scars.

Jap warg lean mismatched eyes xJUKKAWARGx~
a lean warg with mismatched eyes~
A lean warg with mismatched eyes stalks about here.~
   One gray eye and one blue eye peer out from the long 
bear-shaped head of this mature warg. A sharp snout juts out 
from the front of its head above his maw, which is filled with 
rows of sharp teeth. Sharp ears perk out from the back of his 
head, his massive neck covered with a shaggy black mane. Though 
not being the largest of its kind this warg is still a powerful 
beast and appears capable of carrying a rider. Short strong legs 
end in padded paws with sharp claws, flecks of dried blood 
visible against them. Its black pelt seems to be well-maintained 
and free of burrs.

Felez warg small dirty jagged teeth xMISHEEKAWARGx~
a small, dirty warg with jagged teeth~
A small, dirty warg with jagged yellow teeth prowls here.~
   This ferocious-looking warg is built a bit smaller than the 
average, though still quite a bit larger than a wolf. His fur is 
matted and clumped with dirt and what seems to be dried blood. 
His teeth are crooked and yellow, some are broken, though still 
appear to be sharp. An apparent veteran of combat, his eyes 
constantly root about the area.
