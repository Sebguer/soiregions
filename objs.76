fabric is a vibrant crimson viper outlined in gold.

a large clearing for construction~
a large area north of the bridge has been completely cleared out. The grass and roots for several hundred feet in all directions torn out, and the earth torched.~
   The clearing has been torn up and flattened for many yards in 
each direction, and is almost always abuzz with activity. Large 
burly men are take shifts rolling massive logs across the earth, 
flattening it. The beginnings of a foundation is being dug near 
the center of the area, with great trees having been felled to 
support the insides of the 'trenchwork'. Shovels and picks lay 
strewn about, and a great many men have taken up residence here.

a small working model of a catapult~
A model of a small catapult rests here, collecting dust.~
   This model is a deceptively simple assembly of sanded pine 
wood, yet clearly the work of a skilled hand. A small frame is 
flanked on the front-end by a pair of outward-facing triangles, a 
crossguard set between the two posts. A mixture of nails and 
glue holds it together, and a winded string towards the rear 
holds what appears to be a basket-capped throwing arm. A pair of 
tiny dowels allows the string to be winded tighter, and a strip 
of iron wire threaded through a trio of hooks keeps the arm in 
place.

row of half-decomposed corpses byClub OTHER~
a row of half-decomposed corpses, all dressed in tattered clothing and armor~
A row of half-decomposed corpses are lined up against the cavern wall here, their corpses in tattered black clothes and rusted scale armor.~
   There are a row of corpses here - three to be exact - that 
have been lined up against the rigid stone wall. It is clear 
that they have been there for ages as most of the bodies are bare 
bone. A mere glance with the naked eye alone would not be able 
to determine cause of death or sex. Despite the age, some hunks 
of putrid-smelling flesh still hangs to their bodies, which are 
kept somewhat preserved by the chill air of the cave. But the 
moisture from many rains over the past years has caused the flesh 
to bloat and grow soggy, along with the hair that still clings to 
their scalps. One of the corpses is missing a few random digits 
on its hand. The corpses are adorned in jet-black cloaks, and 
all have collars with double stars engraved into their rusting 
scale collars. Their bodies were once protected by gleaming 
scale armor, but it has since deteriorated to orange mush due to 
the water.

a small black quiver~
A small black quiver has been left here.~
   This small thin cylindrical quiver appears to hold few arrows. 
Inside the tube leather wedges hold the shafts of arrows or bolts 
tightly while their tips lightly pierce a wooden block at the 
base. While sacrificing capacity for immobility the quiver looks 
able to attach to the ankle and affords the wearer the confidence 
of a full range of motion. The exterior is a dull black high 
quality leather with subtle accents of a tree running along the 
front edge and blooming into a branch accented aperture at the 
top. At the base leather straps appear intended to tie about the 
ankle while at the top a wide leather strap sports a muted brass 
buckle that allows the wearer to secure the quiver to their body.

They are a clean, gleaming, bone white with nary a nick or

at the majesty of the animal from which they once were borne. 
They have been mounted on a placard of dark hardwood and set into 
a maroon leather cushion. The edge of the mounting cushion is 
held in place by a series of evenly spaced bronze rivets.

blemish is the faintest spray of freckles over the bridge his 
baby-button nose. A pair of wide, thickly-lashed eyes survey the 
world through irises of a pale grey, a delicate, cloud-like hue. 
Despite his chubbiness, his limbs move with a strength of 
purpose, with tiny hands that grasp tight and legs, ended with 
similarly tiny feet, which kick roughly when he's excited

a flowing gown of bone white silk~
A flowing gown of bone white silk lies crumpled here in a heap~
The softest silk of a medium weight clings and drapes in
folds about the wearer's form. The neckline scoops modestly,
showing only the collarbone as the silk cups and lifts the
breasts slightly, drawing in at the midriff gently to emphasize
the figure, before flaring out at the hips and falling to the
wearer's ankles in a seamless hem. Upon the back of the gown,
embroidered in golden threads is the image of a wonderous gate,
leading into the halls of Mandos.

A pair of bone white silk gloves~
a pair of bone white silk gloves lies here crumpled~
The finest silk threads of bone white wrap around the wearer's
wrist, flowing over the hands and ending in skin tight
fingertips, which allow the wearer to weave with their fingers
protected from wear, without hampering the skill of the weaver.
Upon the back of each hand is the vividly embroidered image of
a spider.
