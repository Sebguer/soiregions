Within a Destroyed Barn~
   This large barn looks to have seen much better days; its 
straw-strewn floor has deep holes dug up, pooling with bloody 
water, and its sides sag inwards, hardly able to support the 
roof. Its large doors have been ripped off at the hinges, 
leaving it open to the road outside, and rafters have been 
smashed and litter the ground.

Shattered Stalls and a Crushed Ladder~
   These once were horse stalls, situated at the far back of what 
used to be a barn - now they are shattered, splintery rubble 
heaps, bits of twisted iron thrown in for good measure, and 
soaked in gore. The smell of rot lingers heavily here, and a 
converted stall to the east, also shattered and broken, is 
littered with bones. A ladder, broken into many pieces, lies on 
its side nearby.

Stall Coverted into a Holding Cell~
   This stall has been converted rather hastily, but thoroughly, 
into a holding cell for prisoners. The floor has been swept 
clean of straw and is plain dirt, though a drip in the ceiling 
allows it to churn to mud in one corner, and the thin wall of the 
barn has been reinforced here several times over by thicker 
wooden planks, making a break-out unlikely. The wooden stall 
door has been rebuilt, taller and wider, and wire mesh, more 
commonly called chicken wire among the villagers, covers much of 
it, and stretches several feet past it, effectively cutting off 
the small stall from any unwanted outside influence.

Straw-Strewn Barn Loft~
   The floor of this small loft has been strewn with straw and 
has a thick, musty smell in the best of weather. From here one 
can see to the north, and below, much of the barn and even go so 
far as to catch a glimpse of the dirt road outside. A wooden 
ladder leads down to the barn floor.

In the Air above the Barn Floor~
   Small dust motes dance majestically in the air above the barn 
floor, though at times are crushed by falling bodies - which in 
turn fall unpleasantly to the ground below, which offers them no 
cushioning for their fall.

A Few Colourful Stalls~
   Set against the wooden wall of the battlements, several small 
stalls have been constructed and stream with once colourful 
banners, or bits of cloth, but have long since fallen into 
disrepair. An old forge, rusted and broken, sits nearby - scrap 
metal, bits of rust, and pieces of the forge itself clutter the 
grassy dirt near it, under the cover of a canvas tarp.

Village Green Near the Northern Wall~
   This field, which sprouts out of the dusty village square to 
the south and meanders northwards until it reaches the wall, is 
more dirt than grass; packed hard in places but deceptively soft 
in others, making the terrain treacherous. A few hay targets 
have been set up against the northern battlements but otherwise 
the place is barren, if open.

Large, Wood-Panelled Entry Hall~
   This hall looks to have once been quite cozy and comfortable, 
with well-cut wooden panelling lining the walls and polished, 
pinewood slats making up the floor of the building. Candle stick 
holders have been bolted to the walls and, though the candles 
themselves are gone and the iron tarnished, cast an air of 
sophistication to the large room. That air, however, is soon 
stale when one surveys the rest of the room: broken furniture has 
been pushed against the far wall, the doors have been battered 
and there are deep gouges in the wood panelled walls, where 
swords have made a lasting impression.

Old Dining Hall~
   This dining hall is a bit dusty, its tables battered and 
aging. Torches have been set in the walls by means of iron hooks 
and cast a yellow light about the area; otherwise this room is 
rather barren.

Cluttered, Unorganized Sitting Room~
   This sitting room is rather plain. Its wood-panelled walls 
are scratched in places, and gouges in others, and bedraggled, 
broken furniture sits lonesome in the center of the room with a 
few scattered bedrolls and cots thrown down haphazardly near 
them. A few hooks in the walls allow torches to light the room 
and a moth-eaten rug has been thrown over the wood floor.

Ramshackle Village Path~
   A ramshackle path cuts from the southern portcullis to deeper 
north inside the tiny village, once cluttered by the livestock 
and ox-carts of farmers bringing their harvest in from the 
surrounding fields to sell, mill and slaughter but now completely 
empty. Underfoot, the path is nothing more than packed dirt. A 
thick ladder set against the western battlements allows one 
access up to them.

Town Square of the Tiny Village~
   The crooked path that cuts from south to east through this 
tiny village enlargens here to a dusty town square, filled with 
stray dogs, debris, and little else. The buildings in this 
section of the village are slightly larger than those found 
elsewhere, a run-down building fashioned from stone and painted 
wood set to the west, clearly once the house of the lord of the 
fiefdom.

Dirt Path Through the Walled Village~
   This dirt path leads through the small stone and wooden houses 
that have been constructed along it, or those that still remain 
standing and mostly whole. Several of the buildings seem 
uninhabited, though a number of brightly painted market stalls 
are arranged directly north of the road, against the wall, and 
offer basic services such as smithying and tinkering to the 
populace. To the east, a rope-lashed portcullis lies, while to 
the northeast a ladder is lain against the battlements.

Dimly Lit Sleeping Quarters~
   This room is lined with several rows of wooden bunks and cots, 
though careful observer would also notice the presence of even 
bedrolls and mats strewn across the floor. Despite being dimly 
lit by only a few sconces the room is comfy, and also boasts a 
small window, which has been set into the northern wall. A cozy 
river rock fireplace has been set against the western wall.

A Rickety Supply Shed~
   The western end of the marshalling yard is covered in the same 
hard packed dirt and leads to a crude open walled shelter that 
backs up right against the compounds boundaries. Looking 
something similar to the inside of a barn, shelves and racks have 
been hammered into the walls and to one side crates and barrels 
piled up. While this crude supply shed does offer some 
protection from the elements, its reliability is questionable as 
the roof itself is clearly holding its share of holes and shoddy 
workmanship.

A Cramped Room Within the Lean-To~
   This cramped room can barely hold three people, and only 
really one comfortably. The floor is of dirt, packed down and 
damp, and the low roof is at a slant, leaving more space to the 
right of the room than the left.

A Tiny Larder~
   This tiny larder has been dug out beneath the main room of the 
lean-to and can only just barely hold a human body, standing 
upright. Its main purpose, as it is slightly damp and cold, 
seems to be holding food - or, alternatively, tools, hides, etc. 
It is a storage cubby.
