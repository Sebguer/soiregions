linen, and is soft to the touch as well as flowing. The drape of 
the fabric is accented by the softly curving bodice, fitting 
slightly with gentle stays along the side seams, and the 
sweetheart neckline. The v-shaped waistline meets the skirt in a 
smooth, ungathered seam, with the skirt being gored for fullness 
by way of several triangles of fabric sewn into its seams. The 
lower hem dusts the tops of the feet, and the long flaring 
sleeves end at the wrist. It is a well-made garment, light and 
breezy, and a splendid accent to most women's bodies.

                 by Silessa Uruindor
 
About fifty pages in length, the book explains the very basics
of dyecraft -- mordants, the proper containers to use, some
basic techniques, and fabrics best for what sort of dye.

A $gemcolor-hilted longsword is here, its blade glinting in the light.~
   This well-crafted sword is of a good length and is tempered to 
a watery shimmer that reflects in the light. A deep groove runs 
the length of the blade, reducing the weight and adjusting the 
equilibrium of its balance. The ricasso is engraved with 
highly-detailed, ornate patterns that sink below the crossguard 
and into the $gemcolor-adorned hilt. The hilt itself is long and 
set with a fine stone at the base of the pommel, and is threaded 
with copper-wired swirls to provide a better grip while tapering 
down to the pommel. All in all, it is a simple but masterfully 
crafted weapon.

would leave a tremendous aftereffect on the breath if consumed.
However, it's quite nutritious and filling.

A heavy pair of blackened ring-mail leggings lies here.~
   These heavy leggings have thick, sturdy iron rings sewn into

rings are large, and have been blackened by the action of fire.

A gold and amber ring lies here in the dust.~
   Made of smooth gold, this ring has a sturdy, hefty band that 
is neither wide nor narrow, but of an adequate width. A polished 
oblong of amber, curved to fit smoothly against the ring, rises 
up from the very surface of the ring, channelled right into the 
gold to form a sort of hill-shaped protrusion. The bezel is 
ornate, if tiny, and shaped like braiding. It is not an 
ostentatious piece, but it is remarkable.

hands and fingers, and have been riveted together in a way that 
allows the wearer some degree of movement. A small metal plate 
has been riveted to the side of each gauntlet, and extends out 
far enough to protect the thumbs of the wearer. The White Tree 
of Gondor has been artfully engraved on the solid piece of metal 
that protects the wrist, the dull gleam of iron visible on the 
otherwise blackened surface.

a birch tree~
A birch tree grows here.~
   This gracile, hardy, tough tree is easy to spot and recognize. 
White, almost silver, bark identifies it immediately. Thin, 
whip- like twigs hang down to form a veil adding to its graceful 
and delicate appearance. Its leaves are small and triangular, 
sometimes diamond-shaped, arranged on thin stalks, their edges 
toothed irregularly. In the spring, long hanging catkins of 
small flowers are worn by male birches, while in autumn, dark 
green catkins are worn by the female. 

This tree can be cut down using the #6axe birch#0 command

A supple coat of $color leather is set here.~
   This coat is long, reaching down to the wearer's calves. It is
constructed of supple $color leather, allowing for great freedom of
movement. A high collar can be flipped up for warmth and protection
against the elements, or folded down. The garment closes by way of
a series of fancy bronze toggles, and is tailored to fit fairly close
to the body. Its sleeves are long and cut full enough to wear over
most clothes or light armor. Though not embroidered or ornamented,
the coat's fine materials speak for themselves.

through a few loops.

   This long-skirted dress is made of fine, mediumweight white 
silk, not so heavy that it's ponderous, but with a good drape and 
weight to it. The bodice is squared, and buttons down the back. 
The wrist-length fitted sleeves close with three bronze buttons 
each. The skirt is not gathered at the waist, but gored, with 
inserted triangles set into each seam, so the dress rounds the 
hips smoothly, flowing to the ankles in folds of swirling silk.

An eagle-shaped silver ring set with sapphires has been left here.~
   Cleverly made in the form of a eagle, this piece of jewelry is 
made of whitish silver. Wings curving backwards to touch at the 
tips, they make the band of the ring. Tiny indications of 
feathers cover the surface, rubbed slightly with a darkening 
agent to bring out the detail. The eyes of the bird are narrow, 
set with tiny slivers of sapphire of the same rich hue of the 
larger stones clutched in its talons. Stylized in appearance, 
the form of the eagle is worked to avoid particularly delicate 
protrusions that might be damaged during everyday use.

A pair of supple, brown leather boots with padded soles have been discarded here. ~
   Made of supple kidskin that has been dyed brown, this pair of 
boots has been designed to muffle the sound made from footfalls. 
Lacking an elevated heel and having a thin, padded sole ensures 
that should the wearer step on dry leaves or a dry twig, the 
sound will be sufficiently muffled. The leather around the foot 
is made of a tough supple leather, and the boots look as though 
they were made specifically for the wearer. The leather rises up 
to just above the wearer's calf.

a sweeping, leaf-hilted scimitar~
A slender, sweeping blade with green-tinted leaf etchings is here.~
   Upon close inspection, this weapon is made of the finest steel 
and forged by expert hands. Its sweeping, single edged blade is 
honed to a razor sharp edge. Towards the upper portion of the 
blade, green tinted etchings of leaves, vines, and tendrills make 
this weapon truly a marvel to behold. In between the razor edge 
and vine etchings, a curved groove has been put along the blade 
to assist the wielder's efforts in swinging it with speed and 
prevent the blade from getting stuck into what it has sliced. 
Its hilt is of well casted bronze, with its crossguard's ends 
curved, one upwards, and the other down. Its handle has been 
wrapped in green leather, and a round bronze pommel extends from 
the bottom, allowing for balance or a two handed grip if need be.

an extensively-written, earthen-brown leather book~
An earthen-brown, leather-bound book rests here, marked with a green leaf.~
   The book is large and a little heavy, bound in a rich, 
earthen-brown leather which has been masterfully tanned and 
embossed on the front cover with an ornate, forest green leaf. 
The pages on the inside are of a heavy yet delicate vellum and 
ivory in color. The writing is in Numenian-Tengwar sigils and of 
beautiful script, the entire book written from cover to cover. 
Its gorgeously illuminated title page reads: 


   Keys to A Happy and Vibrant Garden

   Houses of Horticulturists 
   Weland Pottersby, SR 2470

   Thick, grayish and hearty, this helping of stewed turnips

breeches $color sturdy pair woolen WOOL TEXTILE~
a sturdy pair of $color woolen breeches~
A sturdy pair of $color woolen breeches lies here.~
   This pair of breeches is made of tightly-woven wool, the 
fabric dyed $color and so thick that it is nearly water-proof. 
Due to the nature of the weave, the pair breathes well and is not 
prone to creases, increasing the level of comfort for the wearer. 
The thick-threaded stitches are neat and close and together with 
the sturdiness of the fabric, they make these pants well-suited 
for travel or daily use. The cut is somewhat loose-fitting 
around the thigh area, allowing freedom of movement though they 
fit more snugly around the calves and ankles, allowing them to be 
tucked into a pair of boots.

A small brown crab with a wide oval shell scuttles along here.~
   This small brown crab has a wide, oval, pie-crust edge shell. 
It hunkers down low with its strong and thick claws extended for 
crushing. Its other pointed legs keep it moving frequently and 
the beady black eyes on the top of the shell glare out balefully. 
Once killed and cooked it will make a very pleasant treat.
