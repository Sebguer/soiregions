Base Room for New Morgul~
   New Morgul is now the sole province of the Uruk-Hai, with the 
addition of a small trading depot that acts as a drop-off point 
for the Numenorean estates of Nurn deeper within Mordor. There 
is little point in being here for PCs, save to buy factory 
produce made for the Uruk-Hai warhorde, or make deliveries - 
also, a few of the harder things to find that make no sense to be 
available in a settlement as poor as Tur Edendor will be here, 
namely gems, and perfumery.

Bank of the Morgulduin in the Morgul Vale~
   Rank and smelling strongly of sulphur, the River Morgulduin 
flows at the base of the sheer mountains which form the south 
wall of the Morgul Vale. The river here seems fetid and 
unwholesome, but smaller streams and rivulets join it as it flows 
west, making it increasingly pure as it flows further from Minas 
Morgul. The land near the river seems to have benefited little 
from its moisture, and remains barren, rocky, and near-lifeless. 
   The river flows from the Morgul Vale into the lands of 
Ithilien to the west.

Bank of the Morgulduin in the Morgul Vale~
   The deep and sulphur scented waters of the River Morgulduin 
flow westward, emerging through a large metallic grate set 
beneath a bridge just to the east. The river seems fetid and 
unwholesome, but smaller springs and rivulets join it as it flows 
to the west, rendering it more clean the further it flows from 
Minas Morgul. The river flows right at the base of towering 
basalt and obsidian cliffs which border the south side of the 
Morgul Vale.

Lond Nirnaeth in the Morgul Vale~
   The once great road known among the men of Gondor as Lond 
Nirnaeth travels to the east and southwest, traveling up the 
middle of the narrow canyon known as the Morgul Vale. Only the 
most hearty and stubborn briars and thorned bushes cling to life 
in the near lifeless soil. The vale is bounded to the north and 
south by the steep and foreboding mountain walls of the Ephel 
Duath, the border mountains which surround Mordor. 
   The claw-like top of a dark tower can be seen quite some 
distance to the southeast.

Lond Nirnaeth in the Morgul Vale~
   Rutted and filled with potholes, the road once known as Lond 
Nirnaeth travels east to west down the middle of the Morgul Vale. 
The vale, a long valley which pierces through the border 
mountains which protect the west edge of Mordor, narrows to the 
east. Tall sheer faced cliffs almost seem to lean in over the 
vale to the north and south. The air seems to never quite be 
still, and the occasional scent of sulphur can be discerned on a 
stray breeze.

Lond Nirnaeth in the Morgul Vale~
   Rutted, cracked and full of potholes, the once proud roadway 
crawls east and west across the barren landscape of the Morgul 
Vale. The vale itself narrows to the east, funneled by the near 
vertical peaks that make up Ephel Duath, the barrier mountains 
that surround Mordor. Stubborn shrubs and thorny bushes fight 
for life in the unforgiving soil and dry air. 
   A tall, ominous tower can be seen to the southeast, where it 
rises visibly between the mountain peaks.

Morgul Vale at a Cliff Face~
   A steep cliff-face of black basalt and obsidian seems to lean 
over the floor of the Morgul Vale. Rising thousands of feet from 
the valley floor, the border mountains create a nearly impassable 
barrier protecting the west flank of Mordor. Only Morgul Vale 
provides ready access through this obstacle. Almost unnatural in 
appearance, nothing living clings to the impossibly steep rock 
face. A few streams of smoke or steam escape from cracks or 
vents high above. The air seems to constantly move, and the 
occasional whiff of sulphur is carried on the breeze.

   The cracked and weed covered road once known as Lond Nirnaeth 
travels northeast up the narrowing valley of the Morgul Vale. 
The vale itself is a dry and desolate place, with barren and 
rocky soil in which only the most hearty plants can grow. Both 
the road and its surroundings seem to worsen further east, while 
to the west the land crosses dry plains and eventually opens up 
onto the more fertile countryside of the Ithilien. 
   To the south, the waters of the Morgulduin flow past on their 
journey out of the mouth of the Vale.

   This poorly-maintained road, once known as Lond Nirnaeth to 
the men of Gondor, finally comes to an end here here as it 
crosses a stone bridge before the gates of Minas Morgul to the 
south. The sickly waters of the River Morgulduin rush by from 
the northeast to the west, passing under the bridge. To the 
north, a deep and narrow ravine cuts into the heart of the 
sheer-faced mountains.

   Over the pale, yellow-green waters of the River Morgulduin 
this wide bridge spans. It arches very slightly, and is pieced 
together of relatively smooth stone. The stones, once a light 
grey hue, are now dirtied with blotches of brown and black over 
the surface. Immediately to the south rise the malefic, spired 
gates that guard the main entrance into the city of Minas Morgul, 
while to the north lies a barren valley cutting through the 
mountains.

Before the Great Gates of Minas Morgul~
   The great barbican and gates of Minas Morgul rise up sharply 
to the south, stretching across a break in the mountains. 
Figures can be seen moving amongst the shadowed turrets as they 
keep watch over a bridge to the north and a winding path to the 
south. The path leads down towards city itself, which rises up 
behind massive basalt walls, its great central spire a mockery of 
the shining white tower of Minas Tirith. 
   Mounted on either side of the gates here are a pair of 
ancient, stone statues that have long since been defaced and 
broken. The chiseled faces have been deformed past recognition, 
and the once-white stone pitted and stained to a mottled grey 
hue.

   Immense, roughly-hewn stones of blackened granite are layered 
upon each other to form the walls of this keep that guard 
entrance to the city of Minas Morgul. Arrow-slits are spaced out 
along the northern wall on either side of the gate, looking out 
onto the valley outside. The gate itself is thickly fortified, 
and barred with a heavy slat of iron. To the south, a hardwood 
door leads out of the gatehouse and deeper into the territory of 
the Witchking.

A Narrow Path Before the Gatehouse~
   A squat, stone building fills the northern pass, reinforcing a 
set of spiring gates just beyond it. Leading off from the 
gatehouse is a gravel-strewn pathway that makes an arduous climb 
through the mountains. Far to the south, a tall, claw-topped 
tower can be clearly distinguished amongst the pinnacles of the 
Ephel Duath, giving off an eerie light that is visible even from 
this distance.

orcs or dark-skinned humans marches through, filling the area 
with the echos of booted footsteps crunching upon gravel as they 
travel between Morgul Vale and the city of Minas Morgul.

barren earth that lies at the foot of the mountains. Crumbling 
boulders and bits of rock remain strewn about the ground, 
providing small pockets of shelter but little else.

form of a broad, hard-packed dirt road that snakes its way 
through this valley between the towering cliffs of the Ephel 
Duath. The foul waters of the River Morgulduin flow by to the 
north, its banks dotted with deformed, pale white flowers that 
give off a sickening odor. 
   To the west, a long stone bridge crosses the river, while the 
great gates of Minas Morgul itself stand between a gap in the 
mountains on the southern side of the vale.

At the Northern Gates of Minas Morgul~
   The gate is enormous. A kind of oily metal comprises its 
bones, the bars twisting and arching about in some ancient 
torment. A sculpture in the metal dominates the design, standing 
a foot or so above man height, and covered in loose flowing 
robes. The figure, seemingly reverent and pure, has been 
defaced, broken and torn, his arm shattered. The statue's face 
is so deformed that it looks as if he were stuck in an eternal 
state of pained torment. The metal of the bars is set in the 
dark stone, and the whole thing appears nigh impenetrable.

   Heavy reinforced arches of dark stone form a high, wide 
ceiling above the passage through the gates into the vale of 
Morgul. A thick, iron banded door leads west into a sort of 
guard station bearing an archery slit in the wall for bows and 
crossbows to be aimed into the courtyard. The path inside is 
made of cool cobbled stone that is now mucked and covered with 
dirt and mud in places from the passing of so many feet making 
the passageway somewhat more slick and treacherous. A faint 
layer of ash also covers the walls and open ground. 
   To the south is another doorway which leads deeper into the 
halls of Azun Keep, the Gate to Morgul.

The Great Hall of Azun Keep Near a Small Hardwood Door~
   A small hardwood door directly to the north defends the 
entrance into Azun Keep. In contrast with the heavy stone wall, 
the door seems somewhat unremarkable, and prone to attack. To 
the credit of the ancient architects who designed this fortress, 
the path through the wall, on the other side of the door, 
inclines at a downward angle, and then curves somewhat to the 
south, creating a passage too twisted and impassable for any 
conventional battering ram. Several round holes are scattered 
throughout the door, allowing defenders to attack any enemies on 
the other side with pikes. The rest of the Great Hall is 
somewhat visible through the sooty haze to the south.

   The thick grey stone wall of Azun Keep skirts the room here to 
the east and to the north. It slants slightly inwards on the 
north side of the Keep, following an ancient fortress design that 
supposedly makes the wall near impregnable to heavy bombardment. 
The walls, the floor, and the insides of the scattered arrow 
slits, are covered with age-old mold and muck, leaving the entire 
keep dark and grimy. 
   A set of dank, stone stairs wind downward here, leading 
underground beneath the gatekeep.

   The two enormous slabs of grey stone come together into a 
sharp corner. The wall to the north is slightly tilted inwards 
and sports a whole assortment of wedge-shaped arrow slits. The 
walls are generally smooth to the touch, being covered by a layer 
of ancient black mildew. The mildew is apparently extremely 
toxic, as, in the corner, there are several rotting corpses of 
very thin goblins with the black mildew growing around the mouth 
area.

They are in various states of decay, some being little more

bodies, the gaunt faces are twisted into masks of agony, with
a heavy black mildew growing around the mouths. Rat droppings
litter the ground around and among the bodies, but the bodies
themselves are strangely untouched, no bite-marks visible on
the flesh stretched tight over their protruding bones.

The mildew that covers these walls is very thick, the normally
circular patches giving way to a clinging mass which blankets
the walls, covering any gaps in the grey stone. It is black in
colour, dark against the lighter-coloured stone walls, with the
occasional small white splotches adding contrast. The air is
thick where the mildew grows the most dense, a heavy, acrid
stench assailing the nostrils.

   The western wall of the Great Hall looms to the west. This 
portion of the hall appears to have once been a makeshift mess 
hall. Large pieces of stone and wood that once used to be tables 
and benches, and are now too large to remove by means of either 
of the two small doors, are scattered around the area. A small 
fireplace has been built into the wall to the south. A clay pipe 
with a large funnel hangs over the fireplace, sending the smoke 
outside of the Great Hall. Directly west of the fireplace, there 
hangs a tattered rag resembling a tapestry.

A large woolen article that once used to be a tapestry hangs
upon the wall.  While it used to cover most of this entire section

multi-centennial life, someone walked by, and detached a piece from
the bottom of the tapestry.  Currently, the only parts remaining
are those that are just above a taller man's arm-reach.  Most of
the colors have been faded, or eaten away by moths.  From a
distance, one can merely see the resemblance of a yellow sun in
the upper right hand corner.

The Center of the Great Hall~
   The Great Hall of the Keep expands in all cardinal directions 
here. To the north, a small reinforced hardwood door leads 
outside of the fortifications of the keep, while at the end of 
the hall to the south, a reinforced portcullis leads inside the 
city. Several white marble columns carved in a classic style 
reminiscent of that of the early Far Haradrim help support the 
stone ceiling above. An unpleasant odor emanates from somewhere 
to the southwest.

The Great Hall of Azun Keep~
   To the east, a heavy, grime-covered dark grey stone wall 
provides the external support for Azun Keep. The wall has been 
designed wide enough so as to be able to withstand the volleys of 
some of the larger catapults; a large orc would be able to lie 
down lengthwise into any of the wedge-shaped arrow slits 
scattered at regular intervals along the massive stone structure. 
The usual dirt-covered state of the Keep's hall is even thicker 
here, the packed soil deliberately laid for this recently 
converted section of the building. Under the careful scrutiny of 
crest-helmed Black Watch and slit-visored Uruk-Hai training 
between many different components of the Witchking's Horde takes 
place, both spars and other training of the militant bent.

leaving a small, narrow, irregular staircase that leads down into 
a dank cavern below. The wall is basically intact, but it is 
visible where its foundations have been destroyed; the cavern 
below cuts away to the south. The staircase is very slimy, and 
most of the orcs and goblins that climb or descend it tend to use 
their hands for support.

   Much stonework has gone into the creation of this great hall. 
Several white pillars have been erected to support the huge stone 
ceiling far above. A putrid smell floats in the air, and seems 
to be drifting from the east. To the northeast is a spiral 
staircase that leads upwards. To the west, a small hole in the 
floor reveals a dangerous staircase lowering into a dark cavern. 
   A large archway leads into the city to the south.

The Great Hall of Azun Keep near a Spiral Stair~
   The large grey walls come together from the east and south 
into a lighter-colored, worn cornerstone. The entire corner is 
particularly putrid and unsanitary, as a large pile of garbage 
and refuse has been mashed beneath a narrow, rusted-iron, spiral 
staircase. A thick cloud of large, wicked flies circles around 
the staircase, ready to defend its prize against any competition. 
Occasionally, some starved goblin or orc would attempt to catch 
some flies to supplement his or her supper.

refuse garbage flies~
This rickety-looking staircase rises up from the bare floor, its
rusted iron struts bent slightly. A thin handrail follows the
staircase from bottom to top on each side, the wrought-iron
lacking any sort of ornamentation, save only for the occasional
large dent or scratch. The stairs themselves are wide enough for
only two humans to walk abreast, and even then only if they are
of slight built. In sharp contrast to the dark-red rust which
coats the railings and supports along the sides of the staircase,
the stairs themselves are smooth and shiny, a testament to
heavy and frequent use.

A Fortified Archway Between Minas Morgul and the Black Gates of Azun~
   A solid, black stone archway looms overhead at a height great 
enough for the tallest of trolls to pass through. A series of 
stairs leads north, deeper into the gate fortress while a simple, 
unadorned door lies to the west. A heavy iron gate bars further 
passage south of here, clearly meant to keep those who do not 
belong inside out. Faces carved from beautiful white stone are 
now stained black from soot as numerous torch holders have been 
erected here in order to keep this part of the fortress lit at 
all times of the day.

Many of these faces bear likeness to benevolent or stern old men, their countena

hich provides sharp contrast to the black soot which stains all but a few small 
portions of any given face, a result of the many torches which have been install

and scratches on the white stone, a testament to the destructiveness of the orc-
kind which pass by them daily.

Morgul Tower Road Before a Large Fortress~
   The stone-cobbled path comes to an abrupt halt here at a pair 
of arching iron gates set deeply into the dark granite of a large 
fortress. Two oversized braziers hang from the walls, lit with 
an intense flame at all times of the day and lighting the stairs 
leading up into the stronghold. Heavily-armoured blocks of 
Uruk-Hai march north and south along the street at all times 
during both day and night, occasionally leading a line of 
shackled goblin slaves before them.

At the Gates of the Traveler Quarter~
   A pair of tall, weathered gates stand to the west, looking 
somewhat damaged and slightly charred, leading in to the Traveler 
Quarter. Lashed to the farmost northern end of the gate is a 
massive ivorty tusk that curves outward to cast a shadow upon the 
stone cobbled path that runs north and south in front of the 
gates. On the eastern side of the street is a squat, stone 
building from which emanate all sorts of loud barking.

Morgul Tower Road~
   The Morgul Tower road runs straight north and south between 
Azun Gatekeep and the Dark Tower, freshly cobbled of dark black 
stone. High, sturdy walls rise up on either side of the road, 
the western one made of tar-covered logs, while the eastern one 
is constructed from stone. The walls serve to separate areas of 
the city from one another, and cast a shadow upon the street at 
all hours of the day but high noon.

   An ancient stone fence, much older than the construction of 
Minas Morgul, rises up to the east here, a twisted heap of bronze 
set in its centre, the entrance way filled with stone rubble and 
wooden debris. The entrance to the old Black Numenorean quarter 
is blocked, beyond the low wall numerous charred shells of 
buildings visible, as well as the occasional scavenging team of 
goblins lead by burly Uruk-Hai. Morgul Tower Road continues 
north towards a gatehouse and south towards the tower itself, 
restricted on either side by high walls.

   Morgul Tower Road runs straight north and south between Azun 
Gatekeep and the Dark Tower. Heavily patrolled by swarms of 
orkish forces leaving and returning to and from the tower, this 
road is freshly cobbled, of dark black stone. Noisy at all hours 
of the day, shrill cries can be heard in the distance, often 
coming from the tower, keeping those who pass unnerved, and 
making those leaving the road quicken their pace.

Before the Drawbridge to the Tower of Minas Morgul~
   The massive gate of Morgul Tower lies to the south, across the 
swampy moat of noxious, oily water. The gate itself spans the 
width of the moat, opening like a predatory maw. Orcs patrol 
high above on the battlements, donned with dark robes to shield 
against sunlight, while periodically strange lights dance around 
one of the windows followed by a pained howl. The road branches 
north, west, and east here as it enters different sectors of the 
city.

Arena Road West of an Intersection~
   This stone-cobbled road is well constructed, as it holds up 
against constant battering under the passage of people and carts 
at all hours. The dirt to either side of the road is a cracked 
reddish-brown, and occasionally a sprig of green plant might claw 
its way to the surface only to be trampled by the multitude of 
feet and cart wheels. The dauntingly tall Tower of Minas Morgul 
rises up just to the southeast, across a moat of sulphuric water.

   A series of thick logs, blackened with tar and lashed together 
by coarse rope, line the road to the north and form a wall. This 
road sees high traffic at all hours of the day, traversed 
primarily by orc-kin, from tiny goblins to lumbering trolls, 
though the occasional group of men can be seen on the path as it 
leads in and out of the commercial district of the city. The 
stone cobbles underfoot are tread thin, and though crumbling in 
some places are generally maintained by slave labor.

the east, curving around its western bank. A empty intersection 
lies to the south, while this road continues its broad path 
southward towards the arena itself, its black spires visible on 
the horizon. Northward is a bend in the road, disappearing past 
the northwestern flank of the tower. Masses of armoured orcs, 
from the scrap-metal clad horde orcs to the plate-clad Uruk-Hai, 
moving along its length, dispersed by the occasional passing of a 
wagon or cart.

Crossing of Arena Road and Slave Road~
   A steady stream of caravans and wagons turns westward along 
the road here each day, heading into the Slavers' District. 
Lines of shackled slaves, both human and lesser orc-kin, are 
driven at a shuffling pace to their next destination. The ground 
underfoot was smoothly paved at one point in the murky past, but 
is now crumbling in places where the stonework has fallen into 
disrepair. Morgul Tower and its surrounding moat are to the 
east, causing the road to curve slightly.

from the arena district, heavily traveled by orcs and goblins in

of Uruk-Hai visible sparring and marching in regiments.

during the day many orcs turn to cut across the city using this 
street. There is an increased presence of Uruk Hai soldiers 
here, patrolling the area in strict formation. To the north, the 
sheer walls of Morgul Tower rise up to a dizzying height, forcing 
one to crane one's neck to see the top of the tower. The 
street's cobbles are crumbling away at the edges, succumbing to 
the passage of time and traffic.

Morgul, its back facing the street. A well-oiled portcullis is 
set at its base, across a short stone bridge spanning the moat. 
The tower, constructed of the blackest stone, rises up hundreds 
of feet to a claw-shaped top that rends the sky, its sheer-sided 
walls curving slightly and dotted with narrow windows. The 
gateway is guarded by a duty of Uruk Hai soldiers, standing 
silent and motionless at their posts.

Essel Azon At the Borders of the Ruins of the Goblin Slums~
   A crossing of roads occurs here as Essel Azon changes to what 
was once Sharkundu Road to the south, while a dirt path heads 
into the former slums to the east and a short side street cuts 
past Morgul Tower to the west. The paths to the south and east 
are unamangeable, nothing more than tiny walkways through great 
mounds of rubble and wooden debris, stretching from this point to 
the distant sheer walls of the Ephel Duath to the south and east. 
Goblin scavenging parties can be seen working in the ruins of the 
slums.

noisily through at regular intervals, scattering commoners to the

A high, roughly-constructed wall of blackened stone rises up to

many feet as this road leads past Morgul Tower to the west and 
towards the orkish quarter to the south. The piles of trash seen 
elsewhere in the slums are kept to a minimum here and enough

This banner is several feet wide and very long, extending from

very fine wool, and dyed pitch black. In the very center of the
banner, head-height on a tall human, the weave changes shape
and texture to form a representation of a gauntleted fist, and
is dyed a deep bronze colour. Clutched in the fist, the yellow-
dyed weave creating a striking contrast against the black
background, is a lightning bolt, extending diagonally from one
side of the banner to the other. The very bottom edge of the
banner is a slightly duller colour, owing to a heavy layer of
dust collecting there, and the weave is beginning to fray.

being open to the elements and consequently affording an 
unobstructed view of the corrupted, ruined city that is Minas 
Morgul. The floor is rough, molding grey stone, and a balustrade 
raises up about waist-height on the average orc. Goblins are 
reduced to tiny specks, and orc-kin and larger resemble small 
dolls as they roam the city streets and through the gates leading 
in and out of the Keep below. The forbidding mountain range 
stretches out into the distance, becoming a purple haze as it 
merges with the horizon, and the jagged scar of the vale cuts 
haphazardly along to the west.

itself known, it sounds clearly throughout the entire room, 
having the effect of bouncing from wall to wall, creating a 
somewhat eerie feeling. A simple rug lies underfoot, its

   A meandering spiral staircase juts up from the floor here, 
weaving maliciously into the darkness. The uneven and jagged 
stairs are rough and crude, obviously crafted for optimal 
practicality rather than beauty. A thin yet revoltingly goopy 
slime seems to cling to certain steps, and it seems to thicken as 
the stairs approach the bottom floor. Dark granite walls envelop 
the staircase in all directions except to the south, and the 
cracked and jagged floor seems to have been worn, as if by the 
tread of many feet over long years.

   This portion of the cavern extends upward significantly, the 
ceiling becoming invisible within the oppressive darkness. A 
very faint sound of trickling water comes from the east, barely 
audible. The charred and blackened stone walls seem to yield to 
an intersection of some sort here, and the ground is relatively 
smooth. A door to the west hangs unevenly on its hinges, though 
it is padlocked and appears sturdy enough to make opening it by 
force difficult. It is fairly obvious that the floor here 
receives the grace of many footfalls, most of them likely 
belonging to foul creatures.

A Darkened Foyer~
   Dimly lit by fluttering wall lamps, this cold stone room is 
remarkably quiet. Only the most distant echos can be heard of 
the keep proper. A large wall tapestry of the great, lidless eye 
presides over everything, a constant reminder of vigilance. The 
thick iron manacles on the walls and uncomfortable chairs make it 
obvious that visitors can expect little in the way of a warm 
welcome.

A Tightly Twisting Stairwell~
   Winding deeper into the rock, this twisting stairwell curves 
down into the depths of Morgul Tower. Clean and dry, the short, 
sharply turning steps are designed to accomodate those whose feet 
have been chained together. Soot-stained lamps cast an eerie 
glow and set shadows dancing. The ominous flickering and 
capering shades make fitting company to the echoing footsteps 
that carry the doomed to, and more rarely from, the pit below.

A Cold, Stone Room~
   Though well-lit, this room is uncomfortably cold, its stone 
walls stark and unardorned. Thick iron manacles, one set in each 
corner, make this room's purpose as a preliminary holding room 
clear. The soft echo of moans, whimpers of pain, and the 
unmistakeable click of heavy boots on unyielding stone blend to 
provide a constant backdrop of noise.

A Dank, Quiet Cell~
   This tiny, rank little stone cell radiates an air of bleak 
hopelessness. Not even a rodent's scurrying interrupts the quiet 
gloom. A set of thick, jagged wrought-iron manacles adorns each 
wall. The scent of mold and death are the only distractions 
aside from the distant echo of the rooms beyond.

   This large stone room is well lit by several large wall 
sconces as well as a huge bronze brazier in the middle of the 
room. Its flames cast wild shadows across the black stone walls, 
fitting complement to the grim business that goes on here. In 
the center, next to the brazier, are a set of manacles and a 
rather bloody drain hole.

Under the Gates of the Industrial Sector~
   Rising up dozens of feet, the gates of the industrial sector 
loom here, dominating the view of the west. Soot, ash, and grime 
coat the cobblestones of the road, which stretches from the 
western gate to a gate visible some distance to the east. Faint 
clangs are audible a good ways to the east. The road is rather 
well-travelled; whether day or night, an orc or two is sure to be 
seen on its routine. A crude tent has been established on the 
southern side of the road.

Along a Wide, Soot-Covered Road~
   Dirty, grimy, and caked with soot, this road is barely kept in 
a respectable state, given the number of orcs, goblins, and 
various other darker races that traverse it. At any given hour, 
at least a dozen can be seen along its stretch, moving about on 
their daily routine and scarcely loitering. A number of short, 
stout stone dwellings line the road to the south, stuffed 
together to the point where the walls touch each other. Most 
seem in disrepair. On the northern side of the road, a number of 
orc-kin move in and out of a businessplace.

Along a Wide, Soot-Covered Road~
   Not much different than the rest of Minas Morgul, this 
commodious road of the Industrial Sector stretches along east and 
west. Through the cracks between the cobblestones, a variety of 
brown and green weeds sprout, though most are quite trampled. 
Not a yard is in sight all along the south, where a multitude of 
stocky stone buildings are jammed wall-to-wall. Along the 
northern side of the road are a variety of buildings, but one in 
particular has a number of orcs and other dark races entering and 
leaving from time to time.

Along a Wide, Soot-Covered Road~
   Continually traversed by the darker races, this expansive road 
rarely has anyone loitering along its length. Apparently 
constructed in haste out of cobblestone, the road has long since 
fallen into a slight state of disrepair. A hole or large gap 
between cobblestones here and there bears passage for a number of 
green and brown weeds to sprout. At the northern most edge of 
the road, a large, shabby stone building stands, and on the 
southern edge, a number of dwellings are crammed.

Branch off a Wide, Soot-Covered Road~
   Joining together here are two cobblestone roads, one 
stretching east and west between a pair of gates at either end of 
the sector, while snaking along northward is another road, this 
one in a much worse state of disrepair. Sprigs of weeds sprout 
from the ground, and off to the east many loud bangs and clangs 
pierce the air. Though both roads are well-travelled, the 
east-and-west course is a good deal more populated, as small 
throngs of orcs move along it.

   Continuing east to a towering black gate and west to another 
shorter gate, this wide road leads through the squalid stone 
buildings of this sector of Minas Morgul. A constant commotion 
is audible at any given hour, the dark races of men shouting, 
orcs and goblins arguing and chattering, and above all else, a 
number of rhythmic clanging, banging, and clinking sounds 
resonate from the massive building lining the northern edge of 
the road.

   Save for the sky at times, the only colors comprising this 
rather unscenic route's view are the grey of the cobblestones and 
the black of the mounds of soot upon them. Frequently tread 
upon, the stones on this road's surface are old and cracked, 
weeds sprouting from gaps between them in many places. Blocking 
movement to the north is a stocky and very long building, which 
stretches along to the east and west. Along the southern edge of 
the road are a number of stone dwellings, little or no space 
between them.

that travel through them, a pair of blackened iron gates allow 
egress to the east. A soot-covered, grimy cobblestone road 
stretches along here, from the gates to the east to a set of 
similar gates a distance to the west. At any given point along 
the road, a number of squat, stone buildings are crammed 
together, most in disrepair.

along the mountain's craggy face, straightening out only as it 
reaches the eastern gates of Minas Morgul. Though the trail 
itself is kept relatively clear, the ground everywhere else is 
covered in a layer of loose, shifting shale and chunks of black 
rock.

A Roughly-Cobbled Path~
   Though it's still traversable, this branch off the main road 
to the south seems to have seen much better days. Regardless of 
the weather, the view from this path always consists of the 
bleak, dreary greys and blacks of Minas Morgul. Consistent 
throughout the area are the squat, ramshackle stone buildings all 
along the sides of the roads, though to the east lies a mammoth 
building, a gate upon its wall. The path continues northward to 
a curve and southward, where it rejoins with the main road. A 
trail of carriages moves in and out through the area, leading 
from the eastern gate out onto the larger, southern road.

   Here, the rough and sometimes upturned cobblestones of the 
path curve both east and south, snaking their way along the rows 
of ramshackle houses, all seemingly the same design over and over 
along the eges of the street. To the north stands one of many 
stocky, stone buildings, and the street continues its course 
south and east.

A Roughly-Cobbled Path~
   Considering the small amount of traffic visible on this path, 
the cause of its state of disrepair is an obvious neglect to it. 
Upturned and cracked cobblestones abound all along its length, 
and sprigs of weeds sprout through the furrows between the 
stones. Along the northern edge of the street sits a row of 
slave quarters, all extremely similar: short, squat, made of stone, 
and decrepit. Blocking egress to the south is an immense stone 
building, the chimney perched atop its roof continually billowing 
out smoke.

sprawling stonework building; atop its roof sprouts a massive 
chimney, billowing tufts of smoke wafting from it at any given 
time. Echoes of the clangs of metal-on-metal resound from 
within. To the east, the road meets a row of ramshackle, 
run-down slave quarters, indiscernable from one another. The 
path's course continues northward and eastward, snaking through 
even more rows of slave quarter.

Scarcely populated and even more scarcely traversed, the road is 
empty more often than not, and a general silence prevails save

   Ash and soot have been caked onto the dull cobblestones of

east and west. All along the southern edge, several squat, 
stonework buildings are jammed in tightly alongside one another. 
A single, massive building stretches to the north and west, a 
wide pair of doors allowing entrance here. A chimney extends 
from its roof and at all times, day or night, billowing tufts of 
smoke waft out from it.

its stonework walls chipped and cracked, allowing shafts of light 
through from outside during the day. The walls are lined with 
pegs that have either been driven through the boards, or simply 
placed through one of the numerous punched out knot-holes in the 
wood. From the pegs hang bows and crossbows in various stages of 
completion. A table full of tools has been set up in the center 
of this building for the shop owner to stand behind and a rough 
mat has been tossed in the corner for a bed.

additional markings making it out to be a crude, empty 
eye-socket. On either side of the desk are wooden cases 
displaying various weapons or armor, one in particular showcasing 
a battered shoulder plate, its engraving scarred beyond 
recognition. Racks line either wall perpendicular to the door 
and are stacked with weapons and smaller pieces of armor, while a 
few tables closer to the desk are piled up with vests, hauberks 
and the larger pieces of armor. The floor is scuffed, worn by 
many booted feet, a testament to the frequent traffic to and from 
this store.

night, this place never truly quiet. A heavy woolen curtain

   A broad square opens up to the north, west and south, filled 
with a light crowd of travelers, resource dealers, traders, and 
other people who have reason to stay overnight in the Uruk Hai 
stronghold of Minas Morgul and need a place to stay and trade. 
To the east, a pair of tall, wooden gates lead out onto the 
streets of Morgul, open during the day and night. Now and then, 
wagons and carts are driven through the gates both entering and 
exiting the Traveler Quarter, as people move to clear a path for 
the vehicles.

   A few shouts, yells, and haggling conversations are held 
across this large, yet mostly empty bazaar, as merchants bringing 
goods to and from Mordor, to and from distant lands use this 
quarter of Minas Morgul to purchase supplies and hawk their wares 
opportunistically. The square opens up to the south and west, 
while the thick, stone wall of some large building stands to the 
north. Tar-covered, wooden logs that have been lashed together 
form the wall that encloses the Traveler Quarter from the rest of 
the city, running north and south along the eastern perimeter of 
the marketplace.

   Just north of this area of the bazaar stands a large, 
sandstone warehouse. Large amounts of rocky gravel have been 
pummeled deep into the dirt here, making an even path. The air 
is quite hot, and a foul odor of sweating bodies and animal fur 
permeates freely. To the southeast is the opening of the 
Traders' Bazaar, while to the north lies the warehouse. To the

Centre of the Bazaar, About a Well~
   This marketplace is the busiest part of the Traveler Quarter, 
the sounds of haggling and bartering common throughout the area, 
generated by the merchants of various races that deal in bulk 
goods and commodities and use Minas Morgul as a supply point 
between the inner Mordorian lands of Nurn and the distant 
southern kingdom of Haradwaith. Tents and pavilions of 
loosely-woven cloth are pitched within close proximity of each 
other, their occupants doing business buying road-supplies and 
tending to their wagons. The bazaar continues in all directions.

through the bazaar, conducting their daily business. The sounds 
of people yelling, bartering with sellers, and occasionally 
screaming or yelling at others, can be heard all around, and a 
closer sound of men laughing and carrying on can be heard coming 
from a somewhat busy and popular tavern to the west.

traders and merchants from distant lands taking time to relax 
before returning to the dusty roads. The bazaar continues to the 
north and east, where the sounds of people bartering and selling 
can be heard drifting across the area. To the east, a large

quite close proximity to the remnants of the Haradrim Quarter, 
but any progress to the west is halted by a large, seemingly 
newly constructed stables complex. The air is very hot, and 
contains a foul odor of sweat and animal fur. Paths lead in all 
directions save west, heading off to other parts of the Bazaar.

Corner of the Bazaar Before a Few Storefronts~
   Sounds of people yelling and bartering bounce back and forth 
across the busy Bazaar. The smells of dust and sweat are enough 
to choke those people that have not spent a lot of time here and 
grown used to it. A curtain separates this part of the bazaar 
from a small tattoo parlor to the north, while a sizeable 
pavilion stands to the west, heat wafting out through its tent 
flaps. The bazaar spreads out to the south and east.

The Traveler Bazaar Between Some Tents~
   This narrow pathway passes in between many different tents, 
all of various shapes and sizes. Several small pegs stick out of 
the ground, with guide-lines attached to them, to keep people 
from setting up their tents too close to the path. One of the 
tents is a fiery shade of orange while the other is a pale shade 
of blue. The sounds of people chatting, haggling and yelling 
fill the air, as does the pungent aroma of sweat. The path 
continues on north and west through the bazaar, while some 
buildings line the perimeter to the south.

   This room is quite small, wood-panelled walls simple and 
unadorned. Shelves line the back wall, bottles of assorted 
colour dyes arranged neatly on them, and a long, scratched wooden 
counter extends from one wall to the center of the room. Various 
other tools and supplies are on display throughout the room, 
which is overall well-lit though cramped.

Inside, locked cases reveal the goods for sale. Richly decorated
hangings dangle from the walls, but cannot detract from the safe,
structured feel of this small shopfront.

Abdali Street Apothecary~
   This small shop has a pungent, spicy scent that pervades the 
air and threatens to become downright cloying if one remains too 
long. Bundles of dried herbs and colorful vials line numerous 
shelves, giving the room an eclectic, exotic appearance. It is 
the front of a house, with doors leading to living areas and 
storerooms, but the main door leads back out south to the street.

A Stable Supply Hall Surrounded by Pens~
   This is the supply hall for the stable complex. Almost any 
piece of equipment required for the various animals kept in the 
complex can be found here. There are saddles of all shapes and 
sizes, apparently for more than just horses. Large barrels of 
feed have been stacked to the ceiling, and are all appropriately 
labeled. The sounds of the animals being kept here drift through 
the walls. Short wooden doors to both the north and west lead to 
pens where the animals are kept.

Tavern of Biko al'Hajjaj~
   The center of this tavern is dominated by a sunken grill 
filled with smouldering coals and ringed with stones. Sizzling 
meats, vegetables, and cauldrons of stew cook over the firepit, 
filling the room with a warm, spicy aroma. Large pieces of 
leather cured to various shades of tan and brown have been nailed 
to the walls, not only giving them the appearance of tent sides, 
but acting as both a buffer to the noise in the establishment and 
a crude form of insulation. Overhead, the rafters are draped 
with billowing lengths of fabric of a sandy-brown hue. Scattered 
over the earthen floor are thick, wildly patterned rugs and 
tasseled cushions, and while few tables grace the tavern, a row 
of low, flat-topped chests act as both storage for cheeses and 
wines and furniture to eat at for those who prefer such amneties. 
The occasional loud barks of laughter and strings of curses 
punctuate the constant drone of conversation.

Minas Morgul Pawning and Trade Goods~
   Counters and shelves line all four walls of this small store. 
An old wooden sign hanging above one of the shelves announces the 
name of the store. Several small tables have also been set up in 
the middle of the room. The counters, shelves, and tables are 
all littered with various objects for sale. Some of them don't 
appear to be worth very much, but some of them look like they 
might be rather valuable, and most of these valuable items are 
locked in glass display cases. Long strings of beads cover the 
doorway to the east, which leads back out to the Bazaar.

A Small, Dirt-Floor Tattoo Booth~
   This cramped room is lit dimly by torches set in rusting metal 
holders, which are bolted to the shoddy, wood-plank walls. A 
fraying, dark blue woolen rug partially hides the dirt floor, and 
a multitude of small clay pots and needles are arrayed within a 
set of shelves built into the back wall. A table stands in the 
very center of the booth, covered with a stained, off-white linen 
cloth. Beside it is a rickety wooden chair.

Al-Khamin's Fine Threads~
   A gigantic loom towers in the far rear corner of this 
sandstone building, a menagerie of colourful threads woven within 
it, not quite to the point of a finished product yet. A few 
well-crafted wooden tables display a profound plethora of fine 
garments. A wide range of exotic and unusual colours line the 
tables, all masterfully created with meticulous hands. The 
calibre of garb, furniture and the components of the building 
itself insinuate that this is quite a respectable establishment 
within the clothing market. A sturdy mahogany door, draped with 
a curtain of intricately woven blue and yellow threads provides 
access to another room in the building; rugs decorating the rest 
of the wall.

Sweet Smelling Backroom~
   This backroom is quite small, and crowded with perhaps a dozen 
burly figures, all of whom have their faces masked in black 
headscarves. Garbled, muttered dialects of Haradrim are spoken 
softly here, incomprehensibly to even those of the Southern 
nation, and much dealing and trading takes place in the form of 
large, securely sealed crates. From the north, the noises and 
sounds of Biko's tavern can be heard.

About a Large Firepit~
   This corner of the hand-hacked cavern is soot streaked and the 
high ceiling is lost in the thick, hazy cloud of smoke that 
gutters above the heads of most denizens of the underwarrens. To 
the northeast, a large roaring fire burns day and night, 
consuming trash, rats and dead bodies impartially and constantly. 
The entire area is rather cramped, with orkin roasting meat, 
rutting, dancing and dying all in the glow of firelight. A 
tunnel leads away from the clamour to the south.

A Large Construction Site~

having only a set door-frame standing to mark it as anything but 
a pile of trash and refuse.

Inside a Murky Olive Green Shanty~
   This sordid shelter is constructed from mismatched wooden 
boards and large sheets of iron, lashed together with rope in 
some places while other parts of the walls seem to stay together 
out of sheer camaraderie. Gaps and holes in the makeshift walls 
have been patched up with leather and bits of wood, and the whole 
thing seems like it would protect its inhabitants from little 
more than the elements. A broad straw mat occupies a portion of 
the bare ground while the rest is carpeted with skins and furs. 
The roof is a slanted construction of wooden boards hammered 
together with nails that protrude through the inside in places. 
The door is a questionable slab of tarnished metal held in place 
with a padlock on each side.

A Ramshackle Building~
   The hum of the road is virtually non-existent in this 
run-down, derelict building. What windows once existed at its 
front have now been so extensively shuttered up that they are 
thicker than the original walls. The heavy oaken door that 
guards the front is marred with scratches, splotches of paint and 
fungus. The door has a hatch that may be pulled across to peek 
outside. Unlike most buildings in the slums, this one has a 
wooden floor, the poorly laid, old boards creaking as one moves 
across them. Two filthy windows sit on either side of a rickety 
door looking out over the yard.

A Small, Stuffy Room~
   This room is considerably smaller than the front room. It is 
noticeably lacking in floorboards, packed dirt and straw acting 
as a floor instead. It is generally cast into darkness as it has 
no windows, the only glimmer of daylight creeping its way in when 
the door is open. Perhaps as a result of its lack of 
circulation, the room carries a heavy air, its odour generally 
unpleasant with rats and mice often seen peaking above the floor 
or out of the walls. The only exit is to the west, back into the 
buildings largest room.

A Rocky, Barren Yard~
   Uneven as it climbs upwards away from the building to the 
south, this yard is bleak and unforgiving. Only small patches of 
grass claw their way out of the rocky ground, and when they do 
their life tends to be short. The yard is large enough, allowing 
enough space for four or so humans to comfortably move about it. 
To the north the yard is halted by an massive, looming pile of 
trash that towers high above, ending the expansion of this part 
of the slums. Low shanties and two-storey wooden buildings can 
be seen to stretch and twist to the east and west, the high trash 
pile to the north dictating where they be built and their size. 
To the south, a filthy door leads into a building.

A Dismal, Foul-Smelling Wooden Cell~
This dank, unstable wooden cell is barely six foot in height, the only
source of light coming from the tiny cracks and gaps in the few floorboards
above that act as its sole entrance and exit. The ground is made up of
packed dirt and straw and the walls are a mixture of naked soil supported
by the occasional plank of wood. Crude beams support the wooden roof
and the stomping of feet can be heard whenever anyone moves about
above. The air is stuffy, foul and accompanied by the constant squeak
of rats and mice. Cobwebs and their spiders are to be found everywhere
about the cell. A rudimentary step ladder rests by one part of the cell,
allowing one to boost themselves up in order to climb out, once
the rotting trapdoor is opened that is.

Inside a Roomy, Striped Tent~
   Wide and long this well-constructed, red striped tent is roomy 
and comfortable. The canvas dulls the sounds of the surrounding 
market and affords decent shelter from the weather. A plank on 
overturned barrels doubles as a counter. This area of the tent 
is closed off behind the counter by a stout door, set in a wall 
of logs. A sturdy wooden ramp of logs leads down the the square. 
A flag allows you to leave the tent. #6leave tent#8

with mud and straw. A lantern swings from the ceiling throwing 
uneven light across the room. The floor is constructed of bare

ledge. Buildings, most fashioned out of wood but some looking to 
be carved directly out of the mountain can be seen spreading out 
behind the tent and across the plateau. A wide log ramp, chinked

A Squalid, Small Shanty~
   This squalid shanty's thin walls do little to keep out the 
noises of the shantytown, or its smells. Wind howling in along 
the rocks and across the cliffs, between the gaps in the housing, 
brings with it at times scattered rain, choking dust, grit and 
dirt - creeping through the shoddy caulking. The floor is packed 
dirt and a threadbare woolen rug covers much of it, patched 
unevenly and multi-coloured. The shanty is completely windowless 
and appears, while certainly by no means comfortable, in no 
immediate danger of caving into itself. The door, a roughly-cut 
section of thin metal, has a heavy padlock and sturdy iron bolt 
hinges.

A Dilapidated Main Hall~
   Seemingly spacious like a grand entrance hall, this ragged 
room hints at seeing better days. Carved ornamentation in the 
wall has been chipped and in some cases beaten away. Pillars 
that were once aesthetic are broken, giving the room a almost 
claustrophobic feel as if the sinking roof might collapse. 
Crimson, moth-eaten curtains hang over boarded up windows with 
scattered glass about the bare wooden floor. The sole source of 
light here is a busted lantern which gives off a dim shade of 
light. A door to the east leads into another room while a large 
iron ring on the ground hints at the presence of a trapdoor.

A Cold, Stone-Walled Cellar~
   This cellar has been carved out of the mountain and its walls 
are made of natural, black stone. The walls are hardly straight, 
rock jutting out in some places and the corners of the room are 
rounded. The floor is halfway covered with rotten wooden planks 
and the other half of the floor is solid rock ground. A musty 
scent lingers in the air, heavy on the nostrils. A sturdy 
trapdoor with a rocked carved stairs leads up. A dim, dying 
lantern hangs from a hook in the stone wall, the light 
occasionally flickering out.

cracks run down the swollen wooden walls as if the foundation of 
this room were splitting at the seams. The whole room seems to 
lean downward as if built on a slope. Faded, dull grey wooden 
planks line the floor with the occasional loose nail able to 
catch the foot or boot. Patchwork ratty curtains drape over a 
nearby window, giving a dull shade of light to the room.

masonry walls, lending this area a soothing feeling of 
cleanliness and peace. A few simple beds are set on the eastern 
end, where those bearing illness are tended or rest. The 
resident Healer and a wide, operating table stand behind a 
discreet white linen curtain, the stone cover kept spotless when 
not in use.

A Modest, Aromatic Workroom ~
   This modest, pleasant room has whitewashed stone walls and a 
dark tiled floor. Creating a colourful display, bundles of both 
fresh and dried flowers and herbs hang from the ceiling beams 
while several storage pieces are arranged along one wall with a 
long workbench. Rows of shelving hold the various tools and 
ingredients used in the owner's trade and in the west. This room 
seems to double as a common area and a workroom.

A Large, Dark Cellar~
   A flight of ancient grey stone steps lead into this room, the 
center of the steps worn down with a hollow from the centuries of 
use. The walls of the cellar are made of dark grey stone, and it 
appears the cellar was carved out of the rock. Small rustlings 
in the darkness hint that perhaps there are some rodent denziens 
in this cellar. The walls are lined with bins and shelves made 
of roughly smoothed wood, and there are two isles of yet more 
bins and shelves dividing the center of the room into thirds. On 
the west wall can also be seen some ancient wine racks with some 
dusty bottles housed within.

Lightning is provided by a pair of clear glass lamps, as well as 
by a large, clear glass window to the north. This room is silent 
and calm, allowing for the inhabitant to rest or study easily. A 
teakwood door in the western wall and eastern wall provide exit

   A small space set between the second floor and the flat stone

walk without hunching and ducking, lest they strike their heads 
against the hard, dark-stoned roof. Large windows with shutters 
allow a wide view out onto the streets of Tur Edenor and let air 
pass through the room, clearing out the stagnant, slightly 
claustrophobic atmosphere. An opening in the wooden floorboards 
in the north of the room allows one to descend down a stone

A Small, Dusty Yard~
   This dusty yard of packed dirt is rather small. A high stone 
wall and iron-barred gate separates it from the rest of the city, 
topped with cruelly barbed, iron spikes. The noise from the 
street to the north and the Market Square to the far west is a 
muted drone in the yard. Closer, pressed up against the western 
wall, is a small wooden shack: rank smells waft from that 
direction. South is a two-storied stone building. Through its 
open archway can be seen ragged blankets, nests, and cots.

   This small wooden building consists of thinly planked walls, a

the western wall of the outside compound. It is utterly barren 
save for a large trench dug into the packed earth, and this 
trench runs four or five feet into the ground. Judging by the 
hasty construction of both the building and the trench, falling 
in would be easy. Climbing out might prove considerably more 
difficult.

cracks, and are rough to the touch. Simple sconces are placed 
far apart, lighting this spartan room dimly. To the north an 
archway leads out into a dusty yard. In the southwest corner of 
the room a narrow and steep staircase leads upwards to another

as the walls isn't completely even. Cracked stones here and 
there along with signs of blood that wasn't cleaned up properly 
speak of a rough, if recent, past. Torches give off a dim light 
throughout the room when light isn't shining through an 
iron-barred window that looks out over the yard to the north. In 
the southwest corner a narrow staircase with tall steps leads 
down into a similar room below.

glaring boars with jutting tusks, a giant mottled warg with 
mismatched eyes and several wolves baring their fangs and gum. A 
small stone well has been constructed in the centre of this 
underground yard, drips echoing in its dark Small rock alcoves 
have also been hewn from the wall where a variety of things are 
stored from masonry tools to cooking equipment.

A Wooden Cookhouse~
   This wooden structure has been hastily fashioned, the walls 
bereft of any decoration. A small hole in the roof allows for 
smoke to trail out and there are a number of additional windows, 
only covered by thin animal hide flaps. The floor is the 
hard-packed stone of the market square, worn and coarse. A few 
rough stone counters are positioned against the walls and shelves 
atop them.

A Damp Rock-Hewn Corridor~
   Water drips through the craggy rock of this corridor onto the 
cold stone floor giving it a damp and sour twinge to the nose. 
The corridor is roughly straight, leading from a wide oval 
martial yard to the north southward. A number of black iron 
sconces line the jagged walls, casting a dull orange light 
through the area.

A Rock-Hewn Cavern by an Underground Stream~
   The prominent feature of this underground cavern is the little 
stream that passes from the north over the jagged black rock of 
Tur Edendor and south through a thin hole in the rockbed, worn 
through by thousands of years. The cavern itself is roughly 
circular in shape and has been hewn from the very same black 
rock. The stream is tucked into the very western portion of the 
room, where soldiers often relax on straw mats washing their 
equipment. Thanks to the stream, the air down here is much 
cooler than above. So, a number of comfortable chairs and tables 
have been set around the area. A narrow stairwell carved from 
black rock leads to the martial yard above.

A Rock-Hewn Workshop~
   Hewn from the black peaks of Tur Edendor this workshop still 
shows signs of its construction, rubble and masonry tools strewn 
around the base of the walls which themselves bear chisel marks. 
The air inside here is hot and stuffy, even though a small 
iron-barred window looks onto the market square where carts 
rattle by. The room extends further to the south through a 
narrow rock hallway lined with black iron sconces.

A Rock-Hewn Worshop Extension~
   A number of iron sconces have been bolted into the rock hewn 
walls here, shedding ample torchlight over the surroundings. 
Signs of this muggy room's construction are still visible at the 
base of the chiselled walls where debris still lies in heaps. 
That said, there is enough room in this workshop for numerous 
workbenches, shelves and tables.

   A number of iron sconces have been bolted into the rock hewn 
walls of this armory, shedding ample torchlight over the 
surroundings. Signs of this muggy rooms construction are still 
visible at the base of the chiselled walls where debris still 
lies in heaps. Shelves and crates line the two walls that extend 
far into the rock westward.

A Vast Rock-Hewn Barracks~
   Cut from the black rock of Tur Edendor's peaks this vast 
underground barracks opens out from the northern hallway, lit up 
by scores of black iron sconces. Bunks and beds have been 
roughly ordered into blocks alongside the craggy wall. Soldiers 
of all background mill around in this usually quiet atmosphere, 
cleaning equipment, sleeping or talking.

Inside a Craggy Rock Bastion~
   Craggy black stairs lead into this hastily constructed stone 
bastion from a busy hallway below. Torches sputter in black iron 
sconces, shedding ample firelight over the roughly chiselled 
walls. In the western wall of this small bastion an iron-barred 
door has been constructed, winds whistling through the bars.

A Wooden Boardwalk around Black Peaks~
   Harsh winds rush through the high peaks of the Ephel Duath 
here, though not quite strong enough to unsettle this narrow 
wooden boardwalk. Secured tightly with numerous bolts and ropes 
to the black rock, it snakes its way around a blunt peak to the 
north and west. Towering high above the ground, there is a 
decent vantage point over much of South Ithilien here and one 
might glimpse into the town of Tur Edendor far below to the east 
and north.

In the Air Before the Sheer Slopes of the Ephel Duath~
   "Whoops!" is the thought that enters your mind, having fallen 
from the rim of peaks that provides the barrier and border of Tur 
Edendor and now occupying the chill air off the slopes of the 
Ephel Duath. The only direction for you to take now is... down, 
down to the jagged rocks below.

A Wooden Boardwalk in Black Peaks Overlooking South Ithilien~
   Winding around the black peaks of the Ephel Duath this sturdy 
boardwalk is a battlement of sorts, giving a good vantage point 
over South Ithilien. Harsh winds coarse through the stubby 
peaks, threatening to dislodge the lightest of sentries though a 
solid iron handrail has been fastened around the edges. The 
boardwalk continues to the east and meets an intersection.

peaks, threatening to dislodge the lightest of sentries though a

There is a particularly good view here of the ravine road leading 
to the gates of Tur Edendor.

A Rock-Hewn, Wood-Panelled Room~
   The craggy black walls of this room are visible through some 
parts of the wooden slats that have been bolted in place, washed 
with a drab brown paint for some minor decoration. This room 
stretches from west to east and meets another wooden door in the 
roughly hewn rock wall. A number of torches and lamps have been 
hung from black iron pegs on the wall to shed ample light over 
the moderately comfortable room.

A Rock-Hewn Stable~
   A number of wooden stalls are set against the two parallel 
walls of this rock-hewn stable from east to west. Several black 
iron sconces and lanterns have been fastened to the craggy walls, 
casting ample light over the number of horses that are kept here. 
Straw lines the floor of nearly every stall and a wire mesh 
bucket on each door for food. The strong odour of horse manure 
is strong and wafts constantly through the area.

A Balmy Rock-Hewn Cavern~
   This underground cavern is dank, humid and musty. Water drips 
onto the floor from the craggy rock ceiling and forms in puddles 
around the room. The room is enveloped in darkness, only light 
from the above filtering in through a small wooden trapdoor. 
Numerous alcoves in the walls have been cut from the rock for 
storage and a number of sleeping pallets have been strewn around 
on the floor.

A Small, Cramped Shopfront~
   Shelves filled with merchandise nearly cover three walls of 
the inside of this tent. A single lamp hanging from the roof 
with a short length of chain keeps the place lit throughout the 
night. A small passage between the shelves on the southern wall 
leads to an inner room. The bare cobbles of the marketplace 
makes up the floor, but in this small area they have been well 
swept.
