A Hand-Dug Tunnel Forking at a Half-Buried Lead Pipe~
   A trio of diverse pathways merge here, forming a roughly 
recognizable intersection. Northward and southward alike lead 
two manmade tunnels, passages within the earth carved in a 
roughly square shape with the occasional wooden support. The two 
passageways seem to merge together just before the limestone 
passage to the west, which leads into an ancient, cobweb-claimed 
building, the downward slope of the passage obvious. The eastern 
wall has had a section dug out of it, exposing the upper half of 
a pipe which, judging from what is visible, must be at least half 
the height of a man. 
   The steady sound of dripping water can be heard to the north, 
while the occasional stirring of vermin or perhaps something else 
is audible to the west. Southward, the uninviting darkness 
echoes little more than silence.

Within a Cramped Lead Pipe~
   The cramped confines of this cold lead pipe lead both north 
and south, with a hatch in the ceiling leading westward. The icy 
waters are rather brackish, and smell of things far more foul 
than dirt and decay.

A Rapidly-Sloping Hand-Dug Tunnel~
   Supported by the occasional wooden archway, this tunnel 
quickly slopes downward toward the north and upward toward the 
south. The cramped confines allow all but the tallest humans to 
walk entirely upright, though it would only let perhaps two walk 
abreast without hindrance. The floor and ceiling are both 
hard-packed earth with the occasional scrabble, as are the walls, 
for the most part; however, occasionally a bit of masonry 
comprises a section of wall, giving merit to the idea that the 
tunnel was dug with preexisting structures in mind. 
   The tunnel slopes heavily downward to the north, where the 
steady drip of water is easily audible, while toward the south, 
it climbs to a roughly recognizable intersection.

Twisting Hand-Dug Tunnel~
   Being the result of hard labour of hands, spades, shovels and 
any other tool used for digging, this tunnel looks to have been 
dug-out rather recently, or at least been maintained. The cool 
air sits stagnant in the passageway as it makes a series of 
sharp, twisting turns that changes its direction from north to 
east. These numerous modifications seem to have been made in 
mind of existing structures, as pieces of stone masonry can 
sometimes be seen through the dirt walls.

A Narrow Ledge Around a Sheer, Dark Drop~
   An eerie, steady drip of some kind of brackish, blue-black 
water plummets through the center of the gaping hole in the 
tunnel here, landing with resonance in a pool at the bottom. The 
tunnel is supported by walls of limestone to both the west and 
east, as well as the ceiling--or what is left of it--being 
comprised of lime bricks. Upon closer inspection, the center of 
the ceiling above the hole has a gaping crevice in it: the source 
of the drip of liquid. The only way afforded to cross the hole 
in the floor is a narrow ledge along the eastern wall, perhaps 
the span of one's hand in width and over eight feet in length. 
The walls here are thick with sludge, and far worse smells than 
the decay prominent elsewhere waft up from below. 
   The tunnel's easiest, but likely least hospitable, path is 
straight down. The tunnel itself continues east and west; 
however, if one was brave or foolish enough to attempt such, 
numerous handholds in the shoddy lime wall could let one climb up 
to the hole in the ceiling.

A Rough-Walled, Hollowed-Out Vertical Tunnel~
   The wide tunnel here is literally vertical, leading straight 
down toward a pool of brackish, icy, stagnant water. The walls 
are slightly rough, offering the occasional handhold in the form 
of an outcropping of rock. Numerous holes exist in the wall, 
evidence that such handholds don't always work. 
   Below lies the reflective water of an icy pool, while upward 
the shaft continues.

A Stagnant, Icy Cesspool at the Bottom of a Shaft~
   The icy, brackish waters of this cesspool are covered in a 
filmy, sickening sludge of bluish-black hue. The odors put forth 
by the pool suggest a broken sewage line as the source of the 
pool, for far more pungent scents than the decay prevalent 
elsewhere are put forth by the pool. It goes down an 
indeterminable distance, though the pool's wall slopes and allows 
one to amble over it--presenting the option of following a dark, 
rather forboding tunnel northward, or retracing their steps or 
lack thereof upward.

Beneath the Water of a Stagnant, Icy Cesspool~
   The deep and frigid waters of the pool seem thick and 
sluggish, coating the skin and barely making way for one's 
swimming body. The taste, if one were so inclined to open their 
mouth underwater, is far more rancid than the smell, which is 
saying quite a bit. The rock-and-mud walls give way to the 
south, allowing access to an underwater alcove.

A Steeply-Sloping Tunnel Within the Earth~
   Set below the surface of the earth, this passage of hand-dug 
dirt and rock stretches north and south, sloping deeper the 
further south one goes. The occasional wall of stone protruding 
through the roughly- and hastily-dug passage reveal planning 
involved in its creation. Sporadically throughout the tunnel are 
wooden braces, suspending the ceiling of rough earth; however, 
their age and quality are questionable, as is the relative safety 
of the passage. Bootprints can occasionally be picked out of the 
settled dust of the passage, though they are few and far between, 
and many are likely fossilized prints of old. 
   Northward, the tunnel slopes gently upward, while to the 
south, it changes to rocky scrabble rather quickly. Southward 
one can hear the steady, eerie drip of water rhythmically 
resounding against the relative silence.

A Knife-Edge Twist in the Tunnel~
   Here, the dirt-and-rock-walled passage curves sharply, the 
angle less than ninety degrees. Several braces support the 
tunnel throughout its jarring twist, keeping the dirt ceiling 
from caving in on the trodden-dirt floor. The tunnel is tall 
enough for even the tallest of men to walk through without 
stooping or scrunching, though anyone taller than average would 
likely pass through the tendrils of silken cobwebs that hang from 
the ceiling in matted, knotted clumps and drift freely 
occasionally. The only sounds afforded in the tunnel are the 
steady, distant drip of water to the south and the occasional 
flutter of some kind of subterranean vermin. 
   The tunnel straightens out to both the east and the south.

Where a Tunnel and a Ruined, Desolate Street Meet~
   Set deep below the surface of the earth, a tunnel here opens 
in the wall of dirt to the west roughly five feet from the 
ancient-cobbled street that dominates this passage. At least 
twenty feet high, the ceiling above is impossible to see with 
conventional lights, though what can be seen on occasion is 
supported by ancient limestone columns alongside the street. 
Archaic, stained blackish-brown cobblestones, likely once a 
lustrous white, travel from the tunnel's impromptu end to some 
distance east. Aside from the columns and the street, not much 
is notable about this subterranean passage, save the fact that 
the dirt-walled, excavated tunnel itself is of questionable 
source and even more questionable usage. 
   The smaller tunnel, set into the wall roughly five feet from 
the floor, leads westward, while the street itself continues 
eastward.

A Hand-Dug Tunnel Ending at Two Ancient Stone Buildings~
   Here, a labor-made tunnel ends at a pair of buildings: one on 
the north side, and one on the south side. The one to the south 
has had its door excavated, whilst to the north, a slope of dirt 
leading downward allows one access into or out of a window, its 
panes of glass long-smashed, stolen, or nonexistant to begin 
with. Both buildings are rather tall, made of crumbling, 
decaying limestone bricks, both sinking into the floor and rising 
into the ceiling, showing no signs of their true height, nor 
showing any signs of ending any time soon. Aside from the 
passages into the buildings, the tunnel leads westward, further 
into gloom and dark, as well the stale air that threatens to 
choke one no matter which way they go.

Inside a Half-Collapsed, Ancient Stone Building~
   Long abandoned and long ravaged by time and, possibly, 
weather, this subterranean building bears little evidence of its 
time as a home; it is devoid of furniture, absent of tenants, and 
where once may have proliferated the sounds of a bustling market 
or children playing, there is naught but silence and the 
occasional skittering of vermin. The limestone-brick building's 
north wall has been long smashed, the bricks falling inward and 
polluting the floor, making progress difficult. Where once may 
have been wooden stairs, there is now a hole, though enough 
rubble lies below that one can make the journey up or down with 
relative safety. In the southern wall, a single window seems to 
lead outward, though not into daylight; this window now leads 
merely to more underground.

The Bottom Floor of an Exacavated Stone Building~
   Long sent into disrepair, this ancient building of stone 
bricks bears little to no semblance of what it once was. Stairs 
that perhaps lead upward now lead to solid rock and dirt, with 
tattered, crumbled rock and stone abounding throughout the 
building. The floor is of hewn stone, occasionally painted or 
stained in places. Dust and dirt blankets the ground, and stirs 
easily, spraying into a dank must when disturbed. 
   A cold, bleak hallway stretches onward to the east. 
Northward, an ancient door of stone has been fitted into place, 
sporting a fairly large and complex-looking lock, which has been 
irreparably jammed with a large chunk of iron.

one to even attempt such.

Within an Ancient, Half-Collapsed Stone Building~
   Messes of rubble and ruined bricks of lime populate the 
long-forgotten floor of this hoary building, hampering movement 
throughout it. The northern wall has been smashed in some time 
past, likely the source of much of the brick mess. This damage 
has also left a gaping hole in the northern wall, leading out 
into a well-preserved underground street. Throughout the room, 
bits of stone and ruined trinkets of yore can be seen, as well as 
the occasional random bit of skeletal remains. Near the 
southwestern corner of the room, much rubble has been stacked 
below a hole in the ceiling, allowing one relatively easy 
climbing upward.

Upon a Desolate Subterranean Street~
   Cobbled long ago, this street may have seen much use back in 
the days when Kings walked the streets of Osgiliath. Now, 
however, the skies do not stretch endlessly above one's head, but 
rather the ground itself crawls up from beneath to above and 
everything between. Roughly fifteen feet above, the "ceiling" of 
dirt and occasional plant root pays little homage to the 
obviously once-grand view afforded by this street. Northward, 
tall buildings, likely at one point guard towers or spires of 
kingly men, sprout from the ground like weeds, connecting ground 
to ceiling and likely having more than a little to do with this 
cavern not collapsing. Southward, a homely-looking building, 
long crumbling and its front long smashed inward, stands.

Between Buildings on a Subterranean Street~
   A smattering of ancient cobblestones underfoot proves that, at 
some point, this tunnel was actually a street. Perhaps cobbled 
in ancient times long past, the cobblestone is now worn and 
cracked, dulled and yellowed with time, and is in places so 
covered with refuse and dirt that it is impossible to see. 
Further proving the point, two ancient buildings border the 
street--one to the east, and one to the west. While the bricks 
of the western building bear no doors, windows, or even gaps for 
one to attempt to enter it, the eastern building possesses an 
archway, allowing one to enter it if they were so inclined. 
   The street itself continues northward, where it turns, and 
southward, where it ends at a ruined building.

A Wide Underground Street, Curving Around Tall Buildings~
   The ancient cobblestones of the road that runs through this 
tunnel have been worn smooth over time, the roots and vegetation 
that once tried to snake between whatever opening they could find 
having long died. The image of a delicate woman's hand or the 
blade of a forgotten warrior are just a couple of the scattered 
fragments of statue that one may find scattered alongside this 
road. As the passage widens for its curve, a small, circular 
fountain can be seen, an ornate yet shattered spearhead rising in 
its center. A slick muck rests inside the fountain, with 
tentacles of wet moss snaking outward along the road from the 
rim, threatening to slip up anyone daring to walk too closely.

Intersection of Underground, Ruined Streets~
   Here, deep beneath the surface of the earth, two 
long-forgotten cobbled streets within the confines of their 
tunnels intersect. One leads westward, while the other leads 
north. Supporting the cavernous passage, to the south, is a tall 
building of limestone bricks. Long forgotten and crumbling, the 
mausolean building's walls are crumbling, though an archway in 
the wall would allow someone entrance if they desired. Westward 
and northward, the passage continues through the dark, forboding 
gloom of the underground, where the air all about is 
lasceratingly thick and distasteful.

A Desolate Underground Street Curving South and West~
   At one time a grandiose street, the cobblestoned floor of this 
tunnel's passage has long since fallen into disuse, and thus, 
into decay. The cobblestones are cracked, much like shattered 
teeth, in places, and in others, missing entirely. The street is 
enclosed on all sides by rough-walled dirt tunnel, supported very 
sporadically by a tall truss, arcing high into the darkness above 
to support the ceiling some twenty feet up. The tunnel itself 
arcs a gentle curve, sweeping from west to south and vice versa.

The End of a Long, Dark Stone Corridor~
   Perhaps once a manor's hall, or even a hall once walked by the 
kings of old, this corridor has long fallen into ruin and decay. 
The walls, of limestone blocks, seem to absorb the light around 
them, spreading their gloom. They bear cracks and are missing 
chunks in places, shards of dislodged lime littering the floor 
like broken teeth. The corridor continues westward and opens up 
southward with a grandiose archway.

A Large, Well-Maintained Subterranean Chamber~
   Large and hoary, this ancient room was likely, at one time, a 
grand ballroom, or perhaps a throne room in ages long past. 
Whatever it was, it has long since lost function and likely use, 
though age has been kind to it. The walls all remain intact, as 
does the vaulted, domed ceiling. Spiderspinnings dangle from the 
ceiling and from the fluted ledge that wraps around the entire 
room, roughly the height of an average man's waist. The floor is 
littered with vermin droppings and dirt, bearing a few footprints 
but little else in the means of interest. 
   The western, southern, and northern walls all bear symmetrical 
archways, leading into respective tunnels.

   Here, the pipe intersects in three directions: to the north, 
the open pipe allows one to simply follow the current, which 
dictates that you'll move at a rather swift speed northward. 
Toward the south, where the water is flowing from, the pipe is 
cut off by a thick iron grating, which, in spite of much 
pounding, just won't budge. Westwards, a similar pipe leads, 
though it comes swiftly to a dead end.

A Rapidly Sloping Stone-Walled Tunnel~
   This narrow corridor stretches between the darkened depths of 
the buried building it belongs to and a simple hand-dug tunnel 
that has been constructed to the east. The point at which the 
walls connect with the ceiling is layered with thick, matted 
cobwebs that crawl over the ceiling, leaving eerie tendrils to 
hang down in the path of anyone passing through. A musty smell 
of decay and rot is prominent throughout the passage, which 
slopes heavily downward to the west. The limestone walls and 
floor are cracked and dislodged like shattered bones, connecting 
seamlessly to the handmade tunnel's walls eastward.

A Jarring Turn in a Subterranean Passage~
   A ceiling, floor, and pair of walls all of limestone seem to 
absorb the light of this musty, dank passage. Cobwebs abound, 
claiming the entirety of the passage's corners and angles. Here, 
though, the passage turns sharply, moving from the east to the 
north, narrowing viciously in the process--the passage to and 
from the north, though bearing no door, must once have, for it is 
scarcely wider than a heavily-built man. Eastward, the passage 
slopes upward, leading further through a similar passage.

A Twisting, Tight Subterranean Hallway~
   Here, the crusty stone walls twist and turn numerous times. 
The bends of the passage bear no curve; rather, they are simple 
ninety-degree angles, sharp twists and turns to the cardinal 
directions. Heavy, large doors of marble are set into the walls 
at regular intervals, though all are far too old or massive to 
open. Two have fallen from their resting places to rest in 
shattered splinters on the stone floor: one of the doorways leads 
to nothing more than a solid wall of dirt and rock, while the 
other affords egress into another passage. 
   The only open door allows egress eastward, while the passage 
itself leads only southward.

A Dank, Tight Subterranean Hall~
   Made of ancient, niter-encrusted stone, this perfectly square 
passage slopes heavily upward to the west and downward to the 
east, where it levels off and ends. The cramped corridor only 
affords berth enough for three people to walk abreast, scarcely 
tall enough for men of medium height to walk without stooping or 
cocking their heads. Scatterings of bone are scarce but 
definite, with cobwebs and ancient gouges in the stone much more 
prevalent. The occasional skittering of a subterranean creature 
or a piece of stone falling in the darkness can be heard, from 
time to time. 
   The sloping passage continues upward, to the west, but levels 
off and opens with a worn sandstone arch northward at the other 
end.

statue. Apparently, at one point, a soldier in arms, the 
numerous pieces lie askew in shattered memory of what once was: 
half a helmed head here, what may have been a thick broadsword 
there. Littered sporadically throughout the room are a small 
number of bones, long claimed by dust and cobweb. Open archways 
set into the northern, eastern, and western walls likely afforded 
passage to the outdoors at one point, though now no fresh air 
breaks the stagnancy of the musty room, and no access is provided 
save for a sandstone archway leading south, and a hole knocked 
into the eastern wall, leading into a hand-dug tunnel.

An Ancient, Decaying Stone Crypt~
   Obviously ancient, and crumbling beyond repair, this mausolean 
room's walls of limestone brick enclose it in a half-circle, 
using the door as the epicenter. The ceiling is domed and matted 
with dust-covered, long-disused spider spinnings, some spiraling 
downward, though few reach head-height of the average human. 
Several pipes, most roughly the thickness of one's forearm, 
crisscross just below the end of the ceiling's slope, just above 
the heads of the tallest of men. One of these has rusted 
through, and now spills its putrid, crusty, and sludgy water out 
onto where the floor would be; however, the floor long gave up in 
this struggle, and a massive hole lies where the water would 
drip, allowing the fluid to flow straight down a considerable 
distance before reporting with a quiet, distant drip. 
   One could follow the water's path, if they were so inclined, 
or if they weren't paying direct attention to where they were 
walking. Northward, the only door out is of ancient, 
indeterminable rotten wood.

A Circular Room of Cracked Marble~
   Perfectly circular, save for where it has fallen into 
disrepair, this room's marble walls have certainly withstood the 
test of time for a good while. While cracked, it seems to have 
been built sturdily enough to have remained in the fairly good 
condition it currently is in. In fact, a marble staircase, still 
sturdy, built into the curving wall, allows one to ascend to the 
balcony, if they wished. Open doorframes, the doors long rotted 
and gone, lie northward and southward. The floor is cluttered 
with useless bits of rotting bone and ancient useless trinkets.

A Semicircular Balcony Ending at a Staircase~
   In this circular room, one can see a floor below from their 
vantage point on the balcony. Obviously by design and not by 
destruction, the hole in the center of the floor lets one view 
downward, providing there is sufficient light there. If one were 
so inclined, they could utilize the stairs at the end of the 
balcony to curve with the wall until they reached the lower 
level. The walls of this circular room are of niter-encrusted 
marble bricks, ancient and decrepit, and, in most places, 
crumbling hazardously. 
   Set into the northern wall of the circle is a stone door, 
breaking the smooth roundness of the walls.

The End of a Long Crypt Passage~
   This corridor narrows down into a most uncomfortable width, 
leaving little room for manueverability. Slivers of brittle bone 
crunch underneath the feet of passersby, leaving piles of dust. 
The stone walls are frigid to the touch and the ceiling hangs low 
overhead. The cramped space tends to drown out whatever noise is 
being made, whether it be the sound of breath or footsteps close 
behind.

A Bone-Littered Crypt Intersection~
   The scattered human remains become denser around the corners 
of this intersection, forming in large piles with the occasional 
skull visible. As the passage opens up and becomes less cramped, 
ominous shadows are cast against the walls and the crunching of 
the brittle bones underfoot echo down the northern passage 
instead of fading into the stone walls. The environment is cold, 
but holds little moisture, inclining one's exposed skin to itch.

The End of a Bone-Littered Passage~
   The cracked stone ceiling of this narrow passage is low and 
cramped, giving it a claustrophobic feel. A stale, dry smell 
permiates the area, the source being a myriad of bones littering 
the corridor. The scattered remains crack and crunch underfoot, 
making a dull echo sound off the walls in return. A door made of 
rotten wood and threatening to fall from its hinges seems to be 
the only exit from the tight passage. The only other choice is 
to continue on deeper into its stone cold darkness.

Passage Bordered By Doors and Skeletal Remains~
   Stretching far north and south, this passage through the 
crypts bears the rancid stench that can only be produced by 
combining decaying, rotting flesh and putrid days-old human 
refuse. The sources of these two odors are obvious: stacked all 
upon the eastern and western walls are shelves, floor to ceiling, 
bearing corpses and skeletons, while above one's head, just below 
the ceiling, stretches a pipe about the thickness of a grown 
man's thigh, bearing a fist-sized hole just as it meets the 
eastern wall. Sludgy, sickeningly thick "water" drools its way 
down the wall, coating some of the bones and corpses and puddling 
by the wall. 
   Westward, a door of heavy, carved stone allows one to enter a 
small burial chamber, while the passage itself continues 
northward and southward.

Archaic Tomb Claimed by Dust and Cobweb~
   Obviously in a state of relative disuse, this small tomb is 
devoid of the corpses stacked elsewhere, the only corpse possibly 
in the sarcophagus in the middle of it. Probably kept hallow 
since its consecration, in no small part thanks to its perfectly- 
fitted lid, the stone sarcophagus bears difference from the room 
itself: it can be assumed, given all the bootprints in the dust 
and the littering of objects, that this room is less than hallow 
by now.

Ancient, Cobweb-Claimed Crypt~
   Lined with shelf upon shelf set into its lime-brick walls, 
this crypt passage bears signs of decay and disuse, though some 
fresher corpses dictate otherwise. Dust glazes the floor 
thickly, cobwebs matting the ceiling and dangling in spindly 
tendrils, wafting on unseen currents and clinging to whatever 
they touch. Corpses and bones litter the area, most decayed or 
decaying, all dirty or cobweb-covered. 
   To the east, a door of rotten, ancient wood stands, the boards 
flimsy and greenish. North and south, the passage continues.

A Decrepit Crypt Room Littered With Remains~
   Large, crumbling slabs of marble enclose this large chamber in 
an octagonal shape, swabbing the room in a bleak darkness even 
when lit. Obviously a burial chamber of some sort, this room is 
rather barren, save for a dozen or so stone sarcophaguses and a 
small littering of human remains on the limestone-cobbled floor. 
Numerous runic words have been carved into the walls, though 
through the weathering and crumbling upon the ancient stone 
walls, they would likely be indecipherable to any who even knew 
the script. 
   The only exit seems to be westward, through the ancient, 
rickety door of rotted wood.

The Crypts Angling Around A Bend~
   As the catas angle sharply further and further through the 
earth, the air is immediately overtaken, once one rounds the 
bend, by the despicable, rancid stench of rotting flesh, decaying 
viscera, and molding clothing, for all of these things and more 
are stacked amongst the skeletons and corpses upon the shelves 
along the limestone-brick walls. Leading with a gradual decline 
southward and levelling off eastward, the further down one goes, 
generally, the heavier and mustier the air gets, and the more 
noxious the odors become. 
   The crypts angle east and southward.

The Bottom of a Circular Stairwell in the Crypts~
   Crypt passages continue here as they seem to both upwards and 
westwards, lined with shelf upon shelf of skeletal remains and 
nearly-decomposed corpses. The occasional empty-socketed human 
skull peers outward from its resting place, bathing the area in 
unearthly chill and causing an uneasy feeling in most squeamish 
or easily-frightened folk. Limestone bricks comprise the walls, 
floor, and ceiling, the latter of which gives way here for a 
towering spiral staircase of chipped, worn marble, allowing 
access upward. 
   The crypts continue westward, while the staircase provides 
access to the floor above.

Crypts At The Top of a Spiraling Stone Staircase~
The crypts here come to a gradual end, their shelf-lined limestone
bricks ending at a narrow stone archway, long chipped and crumbled
in places. Shelves lined upon the walls are stacked, floor to ceiling,
with corpses and skeletal remains, the occasional bone or rotten
appendage lying out openly on the floor, all claimed by cobweb and
dust--these crypts, however, seem to still be in use. Past the
archway is a tall, spiraling staircase of old stone, cloven and
cracked in places but nonetheless serviceable and sound.
  Westward the crypts continue, though the staircase downward affords
easy egress.

Musty, Niter-Encrusted Intersection~
   The crypt comes to an intersection here, the stone tunnel 
opening at three passages of limestone. Dank, musty air sits 
heavily amongst the niter-encrusted stone, the silk spinning of 
spiders crisscrossing the floor and walls, and little sound 
penetrates this far removed from the surface. On the north, east 
and west walls of the crypts, five sections have been cut out 
from the stone, and stored within there are innumerable ancient 
skulls, femurs and ribcages. To the south, the air becomes 
slightly fresher, the tunnel stretching out in that direction.

rubble. A near solid wall of cobwebs and dust that spreads out 
from every available surface hampers progress through the crypts. 
The bones of those who died many years ago are stacked up in 
alcoves cut from the stone walls, countless remains of people now 
stored below the surface. To the north, the tunnel continues 
further.

   From shelves cut into the stone walls the bones of the human 
body lie, organised by type and all carefully positioned to 
maximize the amount of storage space available. Each and every 
single bone within the human body has been stored in the crypts 
here, some a dark yellow in colour, others lighter, but all are 
free of any organic remains. There is surprisingly little dust 
or cobwebs in this section of the catacombs, obviously still 
being in use. Stale air rises slowly from a staircase located at 
the end of this tunnel, while fresher breezes can be felt from 
the north.

Entryhall of the Crypts~
   The stone architecture of a design and construct to an age 
previous to the current, the crypts are still very much in use 
and operation. A narrow tunnel, wide enough for perhaps two 
people to squeeze past side to side, runs a straight course north 
and south. Five long spaces have been cut out from the stone in 
both the east and west walls, and stored in them are countless 
human bones. Skulls peer down with empty sockets at those who 
walk through the crypts, while a distance down the bones of the 
human arm have been stacked neatly in their alcoves. A stone 
door opens to the north, while the building continues to the 
south.

Corpse-Ridden Section of the Crypts~
   Rancid stenches assail the nostrils with little reprieve in 
this small tract of crypt passage. Limestone bricks comprise the 
walls, floor, and ceiling, the passage gradually declining to the 
west and inclining to the east. Corpses here are likely the 
source of the putrid odors, since they have been piled in various 
states of decay from floor to ceiling in shelves built along the 
walls. Many consist of rotting flesh and decaying muscle, but 
most are to the point where they are simply yellowed bone at this 
point. 
   The passage continues westward and eastward, sloping as it 
goes.

Crypts Angling East and South~
   This twisting passage of crypt meanders its way through the 
underbelly of the city. The turns here are sharp and the 
corridor travels at a consistent declining grade toward the 
south, rising back upward to the east. Several rusty, unusable 
lanterns are placed at regular intervals along the wall and hint 
that this corridor may have been well travelled at one time. 
Now, only the copius amounts of skeletons and corpses in the 
various stages of decay remain, cobwebs long having claimed them 
and clinging desperately to the rare passerby. 
   The crypts continue southward, where they gradually slope 
down, and east, where they gently incline.

Dead End of an Archaic, Skeletal-Lined Passage~
Coming to an abrupt halt here, the passage of crypts both levels
out and stops short on its progress southward. The walls are lined
with countless shelves, most stacked with corpses in various
stages of decay or yellowed skeletons. The room's dank, musty
smell is sometimes accented with the sharp stinging stench of
death and rotting flesh, kicked up by movement in just the wrong
manner.
   To the north, the limestone passage gradually inclines toward
a turn in the passage.

A Metal-and-Stone Sewer Passage~
   Built into the southern face of a cavern's wall, this small, 
rickety platform of iron sways gently when in use. Leading 
originally from the hole in the westward limestone wall to some 
place further eastward, the grated, mesh-iron platform comes to a 
sharp halt to the east, having rusted and fallen apart long ago. 
Far below, one can hear the running of water, not an altogether 
inviting sound. Further eastward, one can just make out a 
crumbling wall of limestone on the other end of the chasm, though 
the jump is far beyond the distance any mortal could make. 
   Eastwards, one could leap for the doorway, but would likely
wind up in the icy pool below. Westwards, a hole in the
limestone-brick wall allows access to an ancient statue room.
A lone pipe emerges from the cliff wall and ends just before
the end of the grating, apparently in disuse.

A Small, Limestone-Walled Entry Hall~
   The stone walls of this short, rectangular entry hall are of 
the same hewn lime bricks as the rest of the catacombs, though 
they have obviously been taken care of to a much greater extent, 
and perhaps refurbished in the not-so-distant past. Despite 
this, numerous cracks and small patches of crumbling brick are 
evident. What may have once been windows on the northern and 
southern walls have been filled with lighter-colored, more recent 
bricks of lime, giving the walls a gaudy, garish feel. 
   The entry hall opens up to the east, while to the west, a 
seemingly new door with bands of iron reinforcing it stands 
strong. Near the door, int he northwestern corner of the room, 
is an ancient, rusted lever, the handle made of fresh rowan wood.

A Wide, Unmoving Cesspool~
   Warm and stagnant, this pool of water lies at the bottom of a 
small chasm. Roughly twelve feet deep, the pool of water is 
extremely tranquil, absolutely unmoving save for disturbances, 
like a person swimming in it. The cavern resonates all speech 
and sound, the walls rounded and worn smooth, affording no 
handholds or footholds upward. Above, one can see a small 
metallic catwalk leading from a chamber to the west to a door to 
the east. A piece of the catwalk is missing, however, and it is 
doubtful that one could even leap to the door, were it open.

Top of a Narrow, Archaic Stone Stairwell~
   More or less simply a nook in the wall, this roughly 
five-by-five enclosure leads directly to a spiral staircase of 
ancient limestone, obviously built whenever the building itself 
is. Cobwebs, matted and thick, drape from the ceiling like 
streamers, with whatever dust that hasn't settled in the unused 
corners of the room clinging to the ancient spider spinnings. 
The floor and walls are of limestone bricks, as is the ceiling, 
wherever visible. The staircase itself seems sturdy enough, and 
while crumbling in places, seems to see enough use to testify to 
its durability. 
   The staircase leads downward, whilst southward, the main hall 
opens back up.

A Refurbished, Subterranean Gathering Place~
   Kept in liveable and even hospitable conditions, this room 
bears difference to most of the others before it. It has 
obviously been refurbished in the not-so-distant past, the walls 
panelled with oak, which has been given a rough and uneven coat 
of stain. The floor is of hewn limestone, ground smooth and worn 
over time by the constant trampling of the feet that so obviously 
utilize it even to this day. Scattered about the room are 
various chairs, tables, and other bits of furniture, about which 
linger a small number of people, mostly those sitting in the 
corner, gambling. To the west, the hall narrows sharply, into a 
small entry hall. The northern wall is graced with a small nook, 
inside of which resides an ancient, spiral stone staircase. 
Eastward, an obviously unplanned archway allows access out of 
this civilized place and into a small dirt cavern--as does a 
similar hole knocked in the southern wall. 
   All four cardinal directions are open, though all seem less 
hospitable than staying here.

A Narrow, Twisting Dirt Passage~
   Being the result of hard labour of hands, spades, shovels and 
any other tool used for digging, this tunnel looks to have been 
dug-out rather recently, or at least been maintained. The cool 
air sits stagnant in the passageway as it makes a short, sharp 
turn that changes its direction from north to west. This route 
seems to have been made in mind of existing structures, as pieces 
of stone masonry can be seen in places through the southern wall.

occasional crate or box holding various trinkets or equipment 
lays about haphazardly. Boot prints are numerous in the dusty 
dirt floor, most coming from or going through the tunnel 
eastward.

Base of a Set of Archaic Stone Stairs~
   Merely a small recession in the wall, this alcove of limestone 
has long been the subject of the rigors of time. Obviously, a 
life buried underground is not a comfortable life, as the walls 
seem to be crumbling in numerous places, and while they may 
threaten upon some to come crashing down, they bear no signs of 
this occurring in the near future. The stone staircase in the 
niche spirals its way upward, leading up to a visible balcony 
above. Through a pair of supportive, chipped, and worn pillars, 
the way south leads to what one could discern to be a barracks. 
A much less ornamental passage--that is to say, a hole knocked in 
the wall--leads eastward, into a chamber of dirt surfaces.

   At one time, this barracks may have been a glorious room in a 
manor, or perhaps a dining room in a kingly hall. Now, however, 
through obvious decades of disuse, its limestone walls have begun 
to crumble in numerous places, though the rubble is nowhere to be 
found. The room has been renovated into a rough barracks, with 
numerous crude bunk beds assembled in a row along the western 
wall. 
   Archways set in the center of the northern, eastern, and 
southern walls allow egress in those directions.

A Forge-Turned-Kitchen, Deep Underground~
   Perhaps once a forge for the town smithy, this room is an 
ancient, hoary chamber full of dulled metal surfaces and an 
archaic, massive forge, long in disuse. However, the forge's 
midsection has been severely retooled, making it look more like a 
stove--and function like one, one would discover--than a forge. 
The forge-room has apparently become a kitchen, from the small 
number of utensils and ingredients scattered about. 
   The only way out is the only way in - the western archway.

A Small, Limestone-Brick-Walled Office~
   Small and cramped, the limestone walls of this demure office 
seem to be built too small for the amount of furniture within it; 
with all of the furnishings, it is difficult for one to move from 
one end of the room to the other, and impossible for one to open 
the door all the way. The walls, crumbling as they are, bear no 
windows and no paint, giving the room a rather bland, drab feel. 
The floor, however, is carpetted rather ornamentally, which lends 
a more homely sense to it. 
   The only exit is the door, northward.

Narrow Tunnel Bordered by Tiny Cells~
   Supported in numerous places by trusses of oak and iron, this 
short passage stretches from east to west for only ten feet or so 
before coming to a dead end. At the end of the hall is a door 
made of iron bars, two similar doors between trusses on either 
the north and south sides of the tunnel. A single, battered heap 
of a lantern, hung from a truss, keeps the area dimly lit.

Tiny Cell~
   Walled in on all sides except one by dirt, this tiny cell's 
only entrance and exit is the door of iron bars to the south. 
Extremely cramped, this cell is far from hospitable, let alone 
standard size. Rancid stenches drift from one of the back 
corners of the room, obviously the makeshift lavatory, where 
different molds and fungi are growing. Through the bars of the 
door, one can see a small room, with at least two other cells 
leading off from it.

A Rough, Dirt-Floored Fighting Pit~
   Lit all about its walls by torches staked into them, this 
roughly circular chamber seems to have been nature's own 
creation, though man seems to have taken a liking to it and 
helped nature to some extent. A wide pit, nearly a foot deep, 
resides in the center of the floor, surrounded on all sides by 
stools and benches. Through the ceiling, arm's length above 
one's head, sprout numerous scraggly and almost ethereal flexible 
finger-like appendages, which, upon further inspection, seem to 
be roots of some kind of subterranean plant. Westwards lies the 
common area.

A Cramped, Shadowy Tunnel~
   Here, a demure tunnel of dirt walls, floor, and ceiling 
stretches from south to west. To the west, one can hear ebbing 
water, while to the south, the steady drip of it resonates 
rhythmically. In both directions, the tunnel opens up to wide, 
sweeping, water-filled chambers. The tunnel itself is merely 
twenty or so feet long, small enough to force grown men 
single-file in a crouch to progress as it arcs west and south.

A Cold, Stone-Walled Landing~
   A set of stone spiral stairs snake away from the stone floor 
here, leading downward. The air is musty and a bit chilly, and 
the moisture inclines one's skin to itch. Dirt abounds on both 
the staircase and landing itself. The only other exit is a door 
to the west, which has been made of stout, dark-hued wood and 
banded time and time again with iron.

Cold Hall at the Base of a Stone Stairwell~
   This dingy, dank stone hallway angles downward toward the 
south, flanked on both sides by doors set into the walls. Torch 
sconces, many abandoned, proliferate upon the walls. Toward the 
eastern end, seven dirty stone steps leads downward and east, 
ending at a solid wooden door, reinforced with iron bands. 
Westward, the hall ends at a door of pure granite, massive and 
heavy on a pair of huge iron hinges. Southward the hall 
continues into the bleak, oppressive silence. A spiral staircase 
leads upward here.

An Ancient, Stone-Walled Meeting Room~
   Kept in far more hospitable conditions than the path used to 
arrive to it, this meeting room bears evidence that is still used 
fairly regularly. Torch-sconces in the four pillars that support 
the room give ample lighting. The limestone floor, matching the 
walls, is kempt and apparently swept fairly regularly. A table 
stands in the center of the room, apparently the conducive center 
of the chambers. Northward, a single doorway leads outward.

A Hoary Crypt's Tomb~
   Obviously in a state of relative disuse, this small tomb is 
devoid of corpses or remains, the only corpses possibly stored in 
the dozen or so sarcophagii that occupy the floorspace. Probably 
kept mostly hallow between consecrations, in no small part thanks 
to their perfectly-fitted lids, the sarcophagii bear difference 
from the room itself; it can be assumed, given all the bootprints 
in the dust, that this room is visited fairly often.

room, packed with various trinkets and seemingly-worthless but 
probably sentimental objects.

   This tunnel looks to have been hand-hewn and continues in a 
general southerly direction, sloping downwards and to the east at 
the same time. The walls are relatively smooth, the ceiling 
easily high enough for a tall person to walk along without having 
to duck. The floor is semi-rough in some places, and has steps 
cut into it, leading further downwards in a long spiral.

A Solid Stone Sewer Passage~
   Made of rectangular, well-tended blocks of limestone, this 
passage through Osgiliath's sewers has likely seen better days. 
While the walls are solid and none of them bear signs of wear, 
the numerous pipes that stream along every cranny of the ceiling 
tell different stories. In fact, they speak volumes about the 
wear they've gone through: many rusty, jagged shards have fallen 
loose on the floor, their iron points worn and ancient, and some 
pipes spill refuse onto the floor, though it is, for the most 
part, avoidable. A single grating set into the ceiling allows 
one to resurface, splinters of light glaring through it during 
daylight hours. A staircase allows one to go further down, while 
a hole knocked cleanly into the northern wall allows one to take 
a long, curvaceous passage northward.

A Wide Chamber Knee-Deep in Water~
   Long and rectangular, this chamber is fairly wide, too wide 
for torchlight to illuminate both ends at once. While the 
ceiling is supported by trusses and made of limestone bricks, the 
walls are coated in a thick, goopy, rancid sludge that makes 
whatever the walls happen to be made of a mystery. Across the 
entire floor, a pool of stagnant, murky brown water. Every small 
stirring of the kicks up clouds of dirt within the lukewarm 
liquid, also churning up less-than-pleasurable odors. A 
staircase allows one to climb out of the water, set into the 
southwestern corner, while a door is set into the eastern wall.

means. The niche opens up westward to a much wider cavern.

   A wide flagstone path leads southward from the street, gently 
meandering through the small, grassy yard toward the house to the 
south. At its termination, the roof of the house extends to 
cover a small porch surrounded by wrought-iron railing. The yard 
itself is bordered by man-high, dark green hedges, each 
meticulously trimmed. A gated opening in the hedge to the east 
opens into a small garden. The porch is accessed through a gap 
in the railing, and a set of double doors flanked by circular 
windows allows passage into the building.

slate blue and is accented by the decorative mahogany table 
nestled against it. Across the hall its counterpart is matching 
in color and is hugged by a large oaken staircase with a polished 
banister supported by wrought-iron spindles. A large, 
semi-circular archway has been set in the southern wall, over the 
top of which a catwalk runs from west to east, accessible from 
the stairs and overlooking both this room and the one adjacent to 
it. The northern wall is dominated by a pair of large, dark 
wooden doors, on either side of which is a circular window.

the grey stone mantle stretching nearly all of the way across the 
slate-blue painted wall. A large, soft grey woolen rug covers 
the majority of the richly-stained oak floor. To the north, a 
semi-circular archway is set into the wall beneath a catwalk 
which stretches from east to west atop the wall. A pale oak door 
stands in the eastern wall, and through a doorless frame in the 
western wall can be seen a large dining table.

been touched up with a light coat of stain. Occupying the 
eastern wall is a sizable window, though it shows little more 
than the dark green hedge running just outside. A heavy, grey 
woolen curtain can be adjusted to either shut the light out or 
allow it in. To one side of the room is a bed, beside which, on 
the wall, the lamp hangs. To the west, an oaken door leads out 
of the bedroom.

leads into the servant's quarters. A trapdoor stands in the 
southwestern corner of the room.

A Stone-Walled Bathroom~
   This rather small room is made almost entirely of flagstone. 
Though mostly clean, small bits of mold can be seen growing in 
some of the deeper cracks between rocks. On the northern wall is 
placed a small, oval mirror, beneath which is a small copper wash 
basin set on top of a pedestal. In the southeast corner of the 
room is a squat metal stove for the purpose of heating water for 
the bathtub. A door to the west opens into the kitchen.

A Small Dormitory~
   Pale yellow paint covers the walls of this small yet cheery 
dormitory. A small, circular window is set in each the western 
and southern walls, covered by green woolen curtains. The floor 
of this room is made of unstained maple and bears small scratches 
in a couple of places. Two small beds are placed in this room, 
one beneath each window. A green curtain hangs over the doorway 
to the north.

A Straight Catwalk Above Two Rooms~
   This catwalk runs east and west, perched on top of a sturdy 
wall that divides two rooms. Peering over the wrought-iron 
railing to the north, one can observe the entry hall and the 
large double doors that lead to the outside of the building, 
while to the south is a spacious living room, its southern wall 
dominated by the stone of a massive fireplace. The floor here is 
carpeted, the wool a dark midnight blue. A staircase descends 
gradually as it moves northward, and there are doors at either 
end of the catwalk.

A Cozy Bedroom~
   The oak-paneled floor in this room is softened by the large, 
plush, light blue woolen rug that occupies the room from nearly 
wall to wall. The walls that enclose this medium-sized bedroom 
have been painted a creamy yellow. Two mahogany-framed, circular 
windows occupy the eastern and southern walls, the bronze curtain 
rods above them holding soft yellow curtains. The bed stands 
against the northern wall, and a doorway lies to the east.

Each of the four walls has been painted a light creme color, with 
a dark blue border running along the top where the wall meets the 
white ceiling. The floor is of darkly stained oak planks, shined 
to a glossy finish. Upon a large rug with its headboard against 
the middle of the southern wall as it extends toward the center 
of the room is a large canopy bed. An open doorway lies to the 
south, while two doors lead west and northward.

chair. More than two people could not fit comfortably inside of

splits into two more which run perpendicularly to it, effectively 
dividing the small, hedge-surrounded garden into three manageable 
rectangles. In the center of the garden, at the meeting of the

a large rosebush.

walls bear a coat of semi-fresh paint, the floor is made up of 
sturdy wooden planks which are in good condition, and the

Frugal Living Quarters~
   This room is spacious yet remarkably plain and senescent. The 
air here carries a dampness to it, accompanied by the faint smell 
of mold and rotten wood. The smell is far from overbearing, 
however, and in fact the room is quite functional. A coat of 
whitewash covers the plain walls of the room and has obviously 
been touched up in some places. Set into the northern wall is an 
obviously old yet sturdy door, while set into the floor of 
well-fitted planks is a trapdoor fixed with an iron ring. A 
doorway is set into the eastern wall, through which a small 
kitchen can be seen.

   This room is rectangular in shape, allowing enough room for 
one or two people at most. The various trappings of a kitchen 
are present: cupboards, cabinets, shelving, and a stove, leaving 
room for little else. The walls here bear signs of moderate heat 
damage, likely a result of open-flame cooking in such a confined 
space. The floor is rather worn, and in places nails can be seen 
protruding from loose planks.

A Forgotten Library~
   Smelling of must and mildew, this ancient room looks, for the 
most part, undisturbed since its burial ages ago. Scraps of 
parchment litter the floor, some bound to tattered, moldy leather 
covers and some shredded beyond recognition. Mold crawls up the 
walls, along with lichens of various sorts, and the air holds a 
heavy moisture to it. 
   The remarkably-intact limestone walls bear a door to the east, 
while a lebrethon staircase leads up to the ceiling.

   Though stone dust, mold and cobwebs mar the once pristine 
beauty of this corridor, even now in its ruin it remains a 
majestic sight. Fluted columns of dusky limestone run the length 
of the hall, rising into the darkness to meet a ceiling hidden 
from view. Set in intermittent alcoves along the wall are busts 
of ancient men, most pocked and worn. The tattered remains of a 
rat-chewed rug runs the length of the corridor, its swirling 
haradaic patterns barely recognizable.

   The lebrethon wood of this balcony has given away to the east, 
succumbing to the ravages of time and, more accurately, the 
blue-black liquid dripping from a man-sized hole in the pipe 
above it. Vines choke the wall here, letting even a novice 
climber get a good grip and haul themselves upward, perhaps into 
the pipe if they so desired. Downward, through the shadows, one 
can perceive the ground, or perhaps just a wide ledge. 
   The steady drip-drip-drip of the liquid echoes from below, 
while a worn doorframe with no door to speak of leads northward.

hundreds of thick, bristly vines mesh as they creep up the 
limestone wall of the building to the north. Above in the 
shadows one can perceive a half-collapsed balcony, one which even 
a novice climber could likely reach with no problem. Here and 
there, a patch of moss dots the wall, giving it a slick spot. 
Vermin and their nests linger about the base of the wall, 
obviously claiming it as their home. 
   A putrid odor wafts in from the east.

Inside an Ancient Damaged Pipe~
   Large enough for a tall man to walk through with head bent, 
this ancient lead pipe seems to have once carried sewage. 
Although the sewage is long since gone, mold grows on several 
rocks jutting out of the floor while a layer of grime covers 
everything, making the pipe truly unpleasant and choking the air. 
Not far away, a gaping, sharp edged hole exists where the metal 
has corroded, allowing egress.

notable feature of the building is the large, stained-glass 
skylight, likely once projecting glorious and majestic images and 
colors into the room below. Now, however, the skylight sees only 
the dirt and slate of the cavern rooftop, as well as the 
occasional dangling root or two. Large pipes made of lead and 
steel snake overhead; one large enough to let a man walk almost 
upright leads southward, with a gaping hole allowing one to go

An Irregularly-Shaped Sewage Tunnel~
   The walls of this tunnel seem angled strangely, as if built 
around something; the ceiling has an odd shape, curved on one 
side and flat on the other, creating a somewhat irregular bulge. 
The passage itself widens here, the two walkways attached to 
either wall coming together at the farthest point to form a 
bridge above the slowly flowing river of sewage that takes up the 
center of the passage. The foul smell that hangs in the cold air 
seems to be rising from the thick liquid, though it is much worse 
the closer one is to the floor.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   A narrow walkway is attached to each wall of this tunnel, 
allowing passage above the river of sewage that flows through 
here. There are no handrails, and the stone floor is slick with 
moisture. Thin streamers of spider's web cling to the corners of 
the ceiling, the strands black with dust and grime. Hanging in 
the cold air is the stench of refuse and of rotting things, which 
seems to be coming from the putrid liquid below.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   This tunnel is roughly rectangular in shape, with two narrow 
walkways, each attached to one side of the passage. Between them 
is a slowly flowing river of dark brownish water, the putrid 
liquid reeking of rotting material and other worse things. The 
gray and black stones that form the walls and ceiling are covered 
in and grime, making their original color impossible to tell.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   Attached to each wall of this tunnel is a narrow stone 
walkway, built well above the river of thick brownish water 
flowing slowly down the center of the passage. However, dark 
stains cover the floor, suggesting that the putrid liquid has, at 
times, overflowed and flooded this area. The entire place smells 
of refuse and rot, and of much fouler things besides. The air is 
cold, and the cobwebs that hang from the ceiling are coated in 
dust and grime.

A Bend in the Tunnels~
   The stones of this tunnel are slick with moisture, the grime 
so thick that the dampness has little effect on the gray-black 
walls and floor. From the ceiling hang thin streamers of 
spider's web, their strands catching only dust. A river of 
brownish liquid flows down the center making the bend of the 
floor, going west to south, and narrow walkways are attached to 
the walls above it, providing solid footing in those directions. 
Thick metal rungs set onto the stones provide access to a large 
circular opening in the ceiling.

of refuse and other rotten things. Two walkways, one attached to 
each wall, provide a path above the putrid brownish liquid, 
though the dark stains that cover the floor indicate that, at 
times, it has not been high enough to avoid flooding. Grime 
coats every stone of the passage, giving it a dirty grayish 
color. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling and cling to the corners, 
catching only dust in the cold air.

A Damp Corner Of The Sewers~
   This damp corner of the sewers smells of refuse and other 
rotten things. The air is cold and somewhat humid, though the 
moisture on the walls has little effect on the layers of grime 
covering the gray-black stones. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling, 
their strands clumped together, catching only dust. The floor is 
slick with some slimy, unidentifiable substance, making it 
somewhat tricky to tread upon.

somewhere nearby.

   The cold air is thick with the smell of refuse and possibly

flowing water, though this part of the sewer seems rather dry. 
The passage slants downward here; in one direction it appears to 
lead to a lower level, while the opposite way goes up, ending in 
a flat stone wall, unremarkable save for the lack of dirt 
covering it. Indeed, most of the nearby surfaces are coated in 
layers of grime, indicating that this particular section may have 
been worked on relatively recently.

A Low, Slanted Tunnel~
   The stench of this place is rivalled only by the cold and the 
damp. The grimy, gray-black stone walls curve together to form a 
low arched ceiling, making standing upright difficult for all but 
the shortest of people. The ground slants downward here, going 
perhaps to some lower level of the sewer. In the opposite 
direction the passage connects to a somewhat larger tunnel, from 
which the sound of running water is clearly audiable.

A Half-Submerged Sewage Tunnel~
   This half-submerged passage appears to branch off from a much 
larger one, the opposite end disappearing around a corner. The 
ground is completely hidden beneath the putrid brownish water and 
a thick layer of foul-smelling sludge, making it impossible to 
see the floor. The stench that rises from the muck is made worse 
by the damp and the cold; it clings to everything and gives the 
air a bitter taste. Several pipes set into the ceiling spew 
forth a constant stream of liquid, most of which gushes out of 
the chamber through another, much larger pipe to the south.

At A Fork In The Sewers~
   The tunnel here widens considerably, with a dryer tunnel 
branching off of it to the east. The river of sewage flows north 
to south, getting narrower as it goes. Where the passage 
branches off, a walkway on either wall converge to form a sort of 
bridge above the putrid liquid, supported from below by brick 
arches. It provides a way across to the walkways in the tunnels 
heading east and west.

someone to hop across, though the slick surfaces could make it

a river of sewage, its surface covered in a thick layer of 
sludge. The air here is cold and reeks of waste and rot, and the 
slightly arched ceiling is coated in grime and old dusty cobwebs.

but more often it disgorges run-off from the streets above.

Lonely Rath Ereth~
   Destitute peasants wander this road with care, looking 
frequently over their shoulders toward the shadows at either side 
of the poorly-lit pathway. The cobbles that mark the passage of 
the backstreet are worn so far into the dirt that they are nearly 
undetectable in some places. Hovels along the northern edge of 
the road squat somberly under the shadow of the towering Third 
Circle wall, the occasional abandoned storefront or crumbling 
stone building interrupting the slump of shanties along the road 
to the south.

Rath Ereth Creeps East And West~
   The grimy back street continues its crawl here, under the 
shadow of the high Third Circle wall. It is dim even during the 
day, although midden fires and torch-bearing peasants light the 
way intermittently. Vermin skitter to and fro, competing with 
grubby-faced children and old women in rags for the scraps left 
by others. To the north and south, sad little hovels line the 
road.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   The walls and ceiling of this tunnel are coated with grime,

side, provide a path above the river of sewage that flows through 
the center of this passage. The surface of the liquid is covered

foul things. Above, cobwebs cling to the corners and hang down 
in the chill air, their delicate strands catching only dust.

Where Rath Ereth Meets A Dark Side Street~
   Rath Ereth widens here like a rat egg in the belly of the 
snake that winds its way along the bottom of the Third Circle 
wall. There is a small press of humanity at most times of the 
day, the poor and infirm who dwell on Rath Ereth creeping from 
their hobbles to take advantage of the stone well at the south 
side of the cracked cobble road. Somber eyes stare out from 
wrinkled faces as the inhabitants go about their daily routine, 
the most desperate among them sorting through midden heaps at 
this crossroads where the occasional hanging lantern struggles 
against the darkness. To the north, the blackness of the shadow 
beneath the wall swallows up a dirt alleyway leading away from 
the road.

A Dark Side Street Before Rath Ereth~
   This cramped dirt pathway wanders north toward the massive 
Third Circle wall, hemmed in by the decaying hulks of the 
shanties populating most of this section of the slums. Refuse 
and scraps of clothing and other less savory material is trampled 
in with the dirt, rats and mangy street animals prowling hungrily 
about in the shadows to pick at whatever a scavenging human may 
have looked over or discarded as too unpalatable. The way widens 
slightly to the south, opening up onto Rath Ereth. To the east, 
a narrow alley limps into the darkness.

A Squeeze Of Hovels Along Rath Ereth~
   Although it widens somewhat to the west, here the lonely back 
street is pressed in tight among the makeshift hovels that line 
it, which seem to edge closer and closer to the road as more crop 
up. Most of the homes are little more than slivers of wood 
tacked together with rope and rusty nails, with the occasional 
slab of cracked stone hitched up against a hole in a wall. At 
all times of the day and night small campfires burn along the 
side of the road and dirty children play in the street.

A Dismal Alley Behind Rath Ereth~
   Though the occasional wary slummer crosses this way on some 
personal errand, this alley is a desolate place. The smell of 
midden and human waste is stronger here than in other parts of 
the slums, and the few forsaken hovels that line the pathway here 
seem almost a part of the accumulation of rotten garbage that 
gives this place its character. The bare path continues eastward 
into the darkness, while a gap between shanties at the north side 
of the alley is wide enough to squeeze through.

A Midden-Clogged Dead End~
   The alleyway stumbles to an abrupt halt against the rotted 
walls of hovels to the east. A large, foul smelling muckheap 
draws flies and overwhelms the senses, swarmed by sickly, 
scavenging rats and insects. To the west the alley creeps back 
into the slums, winding its way among the hovels under the shadow 
of the Third Circle wall. The ground underfoot is mingled dirt 
and trash, and a large stack of crates have been tossed atop a 
midden heap that is piled in the northeastern corner.

A Blind Turn Curving Along The Wall ~
   The alley deadends here against the great wall of the Third 
Circle, cast in perpetual darkness under its wide shadow. Few 
commoners wander into this gloomy tributary, though vermin are 
always present, peeping jealously from the stinking piles of 
garbage that choke the pathway. A handful of lonely, sad little 
hovels hunch in the darkness here, their inhabitants rarely seen 
except through splits in the rotted timbers used to construct 
them.

Knife Twist In An Alley Leading Into The Deep Slums~
   Visibility is abysmal as this alley jerks suddenly between 
east and south, makeshift hovels lurching at odd angles over the 
dirt pathway. The vermin that mingle with slum inhabitants in 
other areas are scarce here, and a certain unnatural quiet looms 
over the alleyway. It is rare to see a human face among the 
garbage and rotted shacks, and those that do creep about in the 
darkness are invariably skittish.

Wooden Gate At The Bottom Of A Refuse Pile~
   The lonesome alleyway plunges down a steep mound--composed of 
a heterogeneous sprawl of refuse, broken furniture, and dirt--as 
it moves eastward, eventually butting up against a rickety, 
whitewashed fence with a rust-hinged gate. The pathway is dark 
and empty on this side, but flickers of torchlight can be seen 
between fence planks, and the muted sounds of life occasionally 
waft over the thin barrier. To the west, the alley creeps into 
further darkness.

A Fenced Square Swarming With Vagrants~
   This square looks as much dug out of the disintegrating shacks 
that surround it as anything, cast in deep shadow by the great 
stone wall of the Third Circle. The few gaps between hovels are 
sealed with fencing which has been whitewashed in the recent 
past, and masses of garbage seem deliberately piled against them 
to reinforce the barrier. In the center of the dirt square a 
small camp has been set up, and rough-looking vagrants mill about 
at all times of the day, eyeing outsiders with predatory 
attention. Some carry weapons and stroll the square with hawkish 
eyes, while others congregate in small groups to talk or trade in 
small quantities.

A Long, Dismal Stretch of Rath Ereth~
   The hovels at either side of this dismal stretch of Rath Ereth 
are sunken and charred, obviously the casualties of a horrific 
fire at some time in the past. Beyond the homes at the southern 
edge of the road, one can just glimpse the backs of more sturdy 
buildings, some of them stone, which face out onto Rath Daelond 
beyond. The cracked cobbles wind east and west into the 
distance, frequently lost among the blackened remains of 
makeshift dwellings. The only illumination is the dim light of 
lanterns on Rath Daelond as it squeezes between the broken 
buildings here, and the occasional slummer carrying a torch.

On Rath Ereth Before A Flophouse~
   The unevenly-cobbled street is not so lonely or so dark as in 
other places. Greasy lanterns at the four corners of this 
makeshift square bathe the area in a dim yellow light at all 
hours of the day and night, and the destitute inhabitants of Rath 
Ereth mill about, many of them coming and going from the 
flophouse at the north. To the south, rickety wooden hovels give 
way to the shadowed backstreet as it winds through the slums, 
tapering to little more than a narrow stone path.

Rath Ereth Curling Through Squat Hovels~
   Makeshift homes of every description line the back street 
here, most composed of a collection of junk and splinters of 
rotted wood thatched together with rope and rusty nails. The 
cracked cobbles that mark the path of the road occasionally 
disappear under newly-constructed hovels which inch closer to the 
center of the street with every passing week. Cooking fires are 
a frequent sight and offer much of the illumination that is to be 
found here, though the winding, cramped nature of the road make 
visibility beyond one's immediate surroundings rather poor. 
Poorly-clothed commoners of all ages mill about here during all 
times of the day.

Rath Ereth Choked By Debris~
   The road comes to an abrupt stop here, piles of midden and the 
soggy remains of burnt-out hovels blocking progress to the east. 
Few commoners venture down this way, and Anor's light utterly 
fails to surmount the giant Third Circle wall to the north. 
Underfoot, the cobbles, cooled by the shadow of the wall, are 
cracked and rubbed flat by feet that no longer travel them. Rath 
Ereth disappears westward into a mob of squat hovels, where 
flickers of light burn in the distance. To the south, a rickety 
fence separates Rath Ereth from an alley off of Rath Daelond, its 
timbers rotted and leaning.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   A slowly flowing river of dark brownish-green water runs down 
the center of this tunnel, its surface covered in a thick layer 
of sludge. To either side, attached to the grimy gray walls, are 
two narrow walkways; they provide a solid surface upon which to 
tread, though the space between them is not very large. The 
stones from which this passage is crafted are worn from age and 
the constant moisture of this place, but they still appear to be 
strong, with only a few cracks here and there. From the low 
ceiling, the occasional cobweb is visible, though all they seem 
to catch is dust.

A Sewage Outflow Chamber~
   This large, nearly-circular chamber is built of huge stone 
blocks and smells of human waste and other rotten things. The 
majority of the floor is taken up by an enormous pool of putrid 
brown water, its surface covered in sludge. There is a narrow 
walkway around the perimeter, and bridges crossing the gaps 
created by the three tunnels that branch off from this room. 
Only the western passage appears to lack solid footing; it 
provides an egress for all the sewage flowing in from the other 
two, though the amount coming in from the southern tunnel is much 
greater than from the eastern one. Dark stains on all the nearby 
surfaces indicate that, at times, there may have been flooding.

surfaces as the sewage flows down the passage.

   This long, wide tunnel is half submerged in sewage, the putrid 
liquid gushing in from several pipes near the ceiling. At the 
far western end are metal rungs set into the wall, leading up to 
what might be a another passage. However, there is a sturdy iron 
grate covering the opening far above. Much of the foul water is 
flowing around a bend to the east, though a great deal of sludge 
has accumulated on the surface, probably due to how slowly it 
seems to be moving.

Inside a Ruined House~
   What remains of a collapsed house has been cleared out, the 
floor is brick partially clad with boards. The walls are stone 
or just rubble and debris. Still somehow the roof above remains 
so perhaps there all walls all way around, just hid behind what 
has been piled up along them. There are doorways visible both 
west and east but both are filled with tightly packed debris, 
bricks, stone and tiles, indicating that perhaps the roof at 
least partially is collapsed. 
   The air is thick with smoke trailing up from the room below 
along the stairway and then caught with no escape but perhaps 
small cracks and glimpses between the stones and a small hole 
hacked out in the corner high up on the south-western wall.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   Two narrow walkways, attached to either wall of this dank 
tunnel, provide a path above the river of sewage that flows 
through the center of the passage. The surface of the liquid is 
covered in a layer of thick brown sludge and other bits of 
floating debris. Though it moves slowly, the all the wastewater 
going through here seems to be travelling at a steady pace.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   The walls and floor of this tunnel are slick with moisture, 
and the air is damp and cold. Two walkways, one on either side 
of the passage, provide a path above the river of sewage that 
flows through here. The surface of the liquid is covered in a 
thick layer of brown sludge and other floating debris. The 
occasional rotten bit of wood or dead rat are visible, and the 
smell that rises from the muck is strong and putrid.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   The stench that rises from the river of sewage flowing through 
here is made worse by the damp and the cold; it clings to 
everything and gives the air a bitter taste. There are two 
walkways, one on either side of the passage, which provide a path 
above the putrid liquid.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   The walls and ceiling of this tunnel are coated with grime, 
giving them a dark gray color. Two stone walkways, one on either 
side, provide a path above the river of sewage that flows through 
the center of this passage. The surface of the liquid is covered 
in a layer of brownish sludge, and smells of refuse and other 
foul things. Above, cobwebs cling to the corners and hang down 
in the chill air, their delicate strands catching only dust.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   This tunnel is roughly rectangular in shape, with two narrow 
walkways, each attached to one side of the passage. Between them 
is a slowly flowing river of dark brownish water, the putrid 
liquid reeking of rotting material and other worse things. The 
gray and black stones that form the walls and ceiling are covered 
in and grime, making their original color impossible to tell.

A Damp Intake Tunnel~
   This dank room reeks of human filth, positioned as it is at 
the veritable headwater of a river of waste. Just to the north, 
a massive grating pumps cold water and human waste into a deep 
channel, which flows turgidly off around a bend. The ground here 
is made of solid limestone blocks, and is constantly damp, 
moisture hanging in the stale air and coating everything in a 
thin sheen of mist. An archway leads off to the east, into what 
looks like some sort of storage facility.

A Forgotten Storage Area~
   This small storage facility is cut from square blocks of 
limestone, its walls lined with empty and half-rotting crates. 
The air here is stale, and reeks of something foul whenever a 
cold gust blows in from the west. A wrought-iron grate cut into 
the northwestern corner of the room provides dim light during the 
daytime, and perhaps a glimpse of the moon at night. It's 
obvious that whatever purpose this facility was used for 
originally, it is now nothing more than one of the forgotten 
places in the vast sewers of Minas Tirith. Footprints in the 
layers of dirt which lie atop the limestone flooring hints that 
someone, at least, remembers that it is here.

A Small, Neatly-Organized Storage Room~
   Deep in the sewers as it is, this room is surprisingly 
well-kept, its walls and floors cut from limestone, cold to the 
touch and slightly damp. The air here is stale, and whiffs of 
human waste can be detected any time a cold breeze - surprisingly 
frequent underground - blows in from the north. A few crates are 
stacked against the southern wall, and shelves mark the western 
and eastern walls. An empty bracket hangs, where a lantern or 
torch might be situated, by the narrow arch that opens back out 
into the rest of the sewers to the north.
