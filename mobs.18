trog Lovely lichen fleshed creature gnarled quashed features XXMT_SEWERS~
a lichen-fleshed creature of gnarled, quashed features~
A lichen-fleshed creature of gnarled, quashed features lurks here.~
   This creature, perilously thin, moves in a nigh on permanently 
hunched over posture. Its eyes and cheeks are sunken around its 
features, making its appearance skull-like, the whites of the 
creature's eyes strangely bright in relation to its ashen, 
sickly-looking skin. Several parts of this vaguely human-shaped 
creature seem to be a housing place for several types of low, 
dull-green lichen, it growing over the person's filthy skin. 
Their arms and legs are stick-thin, the muscle there lean and 
wiry. The creature itself seems to move with an almost 
insectile, ungraceful manner, tongue frequently slipping from 
between slit and cut lips to test the air, snake-like.

Baby Doll trog-child emaciated sunken featured child XXMT_SEWERS~
an emaciated, sunken-featured child~
An emaciated, sunken-featured child is here, crying quietly in the dark.~
   This child, at first glance, looks like nothing more than any 
emaciated, starved child. Whenever the little being breathes, 
her ribs become lightly visible, and her features are gently 
sunken as she looks about. Her eyes are a round, clear blue, and 
she has a mop of blonde hair that'd almost be pretty, were it not 
for the pieces of gunk and muck stuck inside it. Her little 
limbs are wraith-thin, from skeletal fingers to narrow little 
ankles. It'd take one of keen eyes or close inspection to detect 
some of the muck about her fingers is dried, congealing blood and 
the child-like gleam in her eyes is bloodthirsty.

trog Mommy hunched over humanoid filthy skeletal frame bloody features XXMT_SEWERS~
a hunched-over humanoid of filthy, skeletal frame and bloody features~
A hunched-over humanoid of filthy, skeletal frame and bloody features lurks here.~
   This creature looks utterly human at first glance, merely one 
of wraith-like thinness and of emaciated build. Were it to stand 
straight upwards, it'd be as tall as your average Gondorian man, 
and has plain enough features, at a glance. Were one to take a 
closer examination of its face, however, they'd see that there is 
a layer of caked, dried blood all about the creature's mouth, 
matching the entirety of its filth and dirt-stained attire. It 
moves in almost permanent hunch, its fingers malnourished to the 
point of being claw-like and its teeth sharp from long use and 
apparent filing. It looks on almost all that moves, even its own 
kind, with a weighing, assessing hunger. The creature's sunken 
eyes in its skull-like head are quick, darting, and strangely 
white when compared to its ashen complexion and filthy flesh.

a tall, brutish woman~
A tall, brutish woman with a black braid is here.~
   Standing taller than most men, her weather-beaten face is 
marred by several scars, and her eyes, a deep emerald green, peer 
out at the world over a broken nose. A single, thick braid of 
black hair falls over her shoulders reaching nearly to her waist. 
Those shoulders are broad enough to belong to a man, but a very 
ample bosom and wide hips make it plain she is a woman. Strong 
arms, heavy legs and calloused hands show that she is no stranger 
to hard work.

a pitch black, thick-coated Wuldane~
A pitch black, thick-coated Wuldane stands here alertly, its muzzle kept low to the ground.~
   This fierce-looking Wuldane has a narrow chest with a powerful 
back and legs. His paws have a slight webbing between each toe 
and blunt claws to enhance grip on slippery surfaces and other 
kinds of rough terrain. A thick and bulky coat of black-bristled 
hairs consist of what looks like two layers, one made up of tough 
guard hairs that repel water and dirty whilst the second is a 
dense, water-resistant undercoat that insulates. A pair of 
yellow-gold to orange irises watch their surroundings and a 
pointed muzzle sits below with large teeth that distinguish this 
well-trained adult Wuldane from other canids.

Cabbage old wiry bloke oversized ears **PLOTNPCBYHAWKES**~
an old, wiry bloke with oversized ears~
An old, wiry bloke with oversized ears sulks here.~
   Despite being a few years past his prime, this man is still 
quite tall and for the most party healthy, gangly arms and legs 
give him a lanky appearance. His features have taken the worst 
of his long years, overly large ears give him almost comical 
look, gnarled lips curl often in a snarl or frown, this does 
little to hide the fact that he misses nearly half of his 
yellowed teeth. In spite of his awkwardness his manner and 
movements suggest confidence.

Bowser heavy thick set brute balding sparse **PLOTNPCBYHAWKES~
a thickset brute with sparse hair~
A heavyset brute is here, balding.~
   Fat and heavy, this bruiser of a man is little more than a big 
slab of fat and muscle. From his stoomped and slouched, not to 
mention broad, posture, to his barrel-like chest. His features 
are blunt, with a wide pug-nose and double chin. What little 
hair he has left has been stuck down across his his scalp in a 
horrid comeover. He moves slowly and can be heard muttering and 
grumbling through thick lips.

Hawkwind horse destrider white sleek UNIQUE_POIMRI~
a sleek, white-maned destrider~
A sleek, white-maned destrider stands here.~
   Of average bulk and graceful tone, this creature's coat and 
mane are well-groomed and cut, hinting that it leads a life of 
domestication rather than one in the wilderness. Standing tall 
on four muscular legs, there is no hesitancy or fear detectable 
in this horse's posture, seemingly ready to spring into a flurry 
of action and motion at a moment's notice.

a short and stocky black-haired man~
A short and stocky black-haired man is here.~
   Shorter than average men, but very stocky in build, this man 
is powerfully built. Very short-cropped black hair and molasses 
brown eyes join a hooked nose on his somber face. A short beard 
and a trimmed moustache cover his lower face. A barrel chest, 
square shoulders and hairy arms add to his physique. Thick legs 
support him well, but it is apparent he is stronger than he is 
fast. A jagged, white scar winds it's way across his chest, and 
is partially visible on his right shoulder.
