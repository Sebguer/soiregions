A Cluttered Workroom~
A pair of dimly-flickering fluorent tubes sway gently in a
metal-paneled enclosure hung from the ceiling by thin, black
chains. The floor below is home to a large variety of objects,
most appearing to have wires of terminating somewhere on or within
them.

Ruath's Study ~
   A small room, the walls covered in bookshelves tightly packed 
with old and musty tomes.  The floor is of some dark, polished 
wood, and bears faint traces of chalk marks across its surface.  
All manner of strange things rest untidily on the various 
surfaces: the tooth of some vast animal, a small glass jar full 
of murky liquid with something floating inside, a tarnished, 
engraved silver dagger and an astrolabe being among the more 
recognisable artifacts.  In one corner is a wooden desk and 
chair, a great map of Middle-Earth hung just over it.  A small, 
glowing ball of light hovers just over the desk with no visible 
support, and provides the room's only illumination.

Dyanne's Casita Sobre un Gran Arbol~
   Esta casita alegre y acogedora fue construido con cuidado de 
tablos fuertes de roble, juntado con la exactitud de un 
rompecabezas perfecto.  El anden principal sirve como la 
fundacion, cubriendo de lo alto del arbol en una manera en que 
varias ramas entran a hurtadillas y salen por las aberturas 
dentro de los muros de madera.  En medio de una alfombra borrosa 
y azul, un futon comodo con almohadas lanosas y una mesita baja, 
hay una libreria que da carpetazo de montones de libros a lo 
largo de una de las paredes, varios discos compactos de musica 
folk al lado de un estereo caro que esta en el rincon, y se 
culgan muchos dibujos surrealisticos en las paredes.  
   Varias velas se han estado puesto a la redonda, proveer la 
sola luz durante los dias encapotados y las noches oscuras.  Es 
evidente que este cuarto es un lugar para descansar.  
   Una escalera se descende del piso hacia lo que aparece ser el

At the Base of a Great Oak~
   Chunky pieces of root jut out from beneath the grassy ground 
at the trunk of this grand oak tree.  A few stones poke through 
the surface of the ground and occasionally a grasshopper or small 
frog is seen leaping above the taller patches of grass, perhaps 
indicating this spot's closeness to a swamp or marsh.  The 
ground is soft and slightly deeper just at the tree base and 
along some higher bits of root where one might lean against when 
seated on the forest floor.

sparkling crystal figurines. Tall maplewood bookshelves form a
semi-circle on either side, their contents organized neatly in
alphabetical order. Several thick maroon candles burn smokelessly
in silver candelabras, providing light and giving the room a
faint floral fragrance. The floor is covered by plush dark green
carpet which gives way to dull grey flagstones by the fireplace.
   On the north wall a mahogany archway allows passage into

   With old, crumbling stone walls with moss and ivy crawling all 
around, this ancient tower has clearly seen better days.  
Despite its age, the inhabitant appears to use it a great deal, 
judging by the mess.  The floor, also of stone is covered with 
an ancient carpet depicting some ancient legend.  Sitting square 
the the centre of the tower is an ancient hardwood table, heavily 
carved with ancient runes and strange characters.  It is covered 
with various scrolls, tomes of forbidden lore and intricate glass 
beakers.  Covering the eastern wall is an old, moth-eaten 
tapestry, depicting the fall of the fabled isle of Numenor.  
   There are no visible exits, but a strange, silvery-blue portal 
shimmers in the air.

   This shaded, cool forest glade is the sacred dwelling of Vala
Orome, the Lord of Trees, also called Aldaron in the ancient
language of the Quenya.  A narrow, crystal-clear brook runs
under a cluster of bending weeping willows, making a soft, trickling sound that soothes the senses of those fortunate enough
to find shelter here.  The chirping of multi-clored songbirds
echoes merrily among the high branches of the golden mallorn
trees, and the fragrance of wet grass and lovely asphodels and
eglantines fills the air.  An aura of peace and tranquility
pervades this sacred place.

The Chamber of Weeping Angels~
   Deep within the catacombs this place of ancient prayer 
contains many pools of greenish hued water towards the center of 
the room which are filled by rock formations on the ceilings. 
The stalactites and stalagmites reach each other in 4 places in 
the room forming a square around the pools, they come to form 
what almost appears to be a pillar. Adorning each of those 
'pillars' is a statue of what appears to be a weeping angel, each 
facing the center of the room in cold mourning. This chamber is 
entirely quiet outside the dripping of water in the pools. At 
the very center of the room is a paved circle which is made of 
red sandstone. The room is lit by four braziers eternally lit by 
magical green lights that cast a dull haze upon this place of 
meditation.

Club Endore~
   The walls of this chamber, tastefully panelled in rich, dark 
mahogany, lend the area a sophisticated, intimate feel. Tables 
are scattered about in the slightly lowered pit in the room's 
center, and large picture windows set into each of the walls look 
down over the virtual Middle-earth, far, far below. Muted 
laughter and conversation mingle on the air with the soft, 
drifting jazz melodies woven by the four-piece set playing on a 
raised stage in the southwestern corner. A long, polished bar of 
ebonwood runs along the northern wall, and the bartender directs 
the efforts of various servers who drift about the room over the 
dark, plush carpet, dressed in costumes resembling everything 
from bloodthirsty Orkish raiders to mithril-clad Elves.

A Spacious Cavern~
   This cavern is large and spacious with a curved vaulted roof 
that is occasionally interrupted by dripping stalactites. The 
stalagmites have all been removed, crushed, and piled in the 
western corner. Most of the floor has been filed down to a 
smooth surface; a narrow path, covered in a soft rouge velvet 
carpet leads from the south to a polished lapis lazuli stand in 
the center of the cavern.

A Cozy Dwelling of Packed Mud and White-washed Wood~
   This place is rather cozy and warm, due to the warm fireplace 
of gray stone Implanted in the western wall, and the new 
white-washed planks underfoot. The roof has been supported by 
four beams of the same white-washed wood, towering over the room 
in each of the four corners. A giant oval window allows a look 
into a fresh, verdant garden from the northern wall, vegetables 
of all types burgeoning in the bright sunlight which always 
filters into this homey room.

Where Chaos and Form Meet~
   Here is the exact spot where the chaotic tendrils of 
nothingness wrap their grasp around form. Colors clash into a 
small spot that looks enormous enough to swallow worlds, yet 
small enough to not exist. Sounds pass by quicker then light, 
moving slower than the eye can even follow. The dark walls of 
colorful nothing flow seemlessly, futher then possible, yet still 
existing in an almost ethereal web of vibrancy. The Song of Eru 
and the Ainur begin to vibrate form from chaos.

Arval's Farm~
   Floored in elegant, scroll worked mahogany, this circular
office has been built and designed in great taste. Rows of lights
set on a dimmer switch have been embedded into the ceiling,
providing a constant light that can be changed from various controls
around the room.
   Just under the ceiling, two immense bookshelves form each a 
semi-circle along with the contours of the room. Crafted from the
same wood as the floor, they hold book after book. One set stands
into the eastern wall, the other into the west.
   A rounded window follows the features of the southernmost wall,
looking out and down onto Middle-earth from quite a distance.
   To the north, two large, ironbound doors are bound to a light
stone archway, offering a passage to the tower's stairway.

   Winding upward into a dismal gloom, a solid black stairway
starts its trek counterclockwise. Crafted with the utmost care to
detail, an inner wall spirals along with the stairs to one side,
while the outer wall is made of a black-glass window.
   On the eastern wall, a gruesome painting of some sort of ritual
is affixed to the wall, its eyes seemingly staring with an unreal
gaze.
   Hung from the ceiling to the north, a black banner edged with
gold depicts a frightful dragon, its wings spread.

The Hall of Mists~
   The Hall of Mist is a hall unlike any other. The wall seems to
shift and change making it difficult to tell they are even walls 
at all. The boundaries of the walls expand to fit the needs of 
space of the occupants of the room. The western wall is clear 
showing an image as if in a still, clear pool of the planet from 
low orbit. At a single word, it is possible to see anything that
is desired on the planet below. Mist covers the floor and swirls 
about at the feet of those that walk the room, yet beneath it can
be seen that the floor is of polished black marble. The roof is 
the same as the walls.

The Southern Spur~
    Tough wiry grass covers much of the landscape here, broken up
with small clumps of swordweed. Small channels run through the
grass where water welling up from the many springs on the
mountainslope has carved out minature river beds from the thin
layer of soil, baring the unyielding rocky ground beneath.

On the Saddle of Mount Jagungal~
   To the west the ominous crags and rocky pinnacles of the very 
peak of the mountain rise upward like deformed fingers, 
stretching for something just out of reach. Small dark shapes 
fly high over the summit, wheeling and spiralling through the 
air. Away to the east another ridge descends steeply to the 
treeline and beyond to the lake strewn highlands far below. But 
here on the saddle no trees grow, and only the huge boulders 
standing alone or forming great piles of rock offer any cover 
from the weather.

Atop the Peak~
   The view from the summit is spectacular. Rugged mountains
extend as far as the eye can see in every direction save to the
south, where the high moors with their mountain streams and lakes
make up the landscape. Eastward, beyond the saddle, lies the
second, smaller peak of the mountain while to the north a deep
valley filled with thick undergrowth and dark, twisted trees
shrouds the lower slopes. The western side of the mountain drops
in a sheer cliff for many feet below the summit and the rocky
ledges of the cliff are home to many birds of prey who hunt these
ranges. High overhead fly three hawks, small brown specs against
the sky. Their harsh cries sound faint from so far away, as they
circle on the thermals, searching for their next meal.

Oblivion~
   No floor, no roof, no walls. Nothing to stand upon, yet there
seems to be some purchase here. There is no darkness, yet nothing 
to see either. To contemplate the colour, the background, the 
boundaries causes the mind to slip away in a pleasant pink haze. 
There is no sound, no light. Nothing to smell, touch or hear at a 
natural state here. Only the feeling of burning cold alerts one 
that they are here at all, and what comes from the mind to battle 
the utter nothingness.
   A blemish in the grey landscape, a shred of reality in this
unreal plane, can be felt more then seen far above.

Warton Field~
Stretching to the horizon in all four points of the compass, this
field is bordered all round by distance mountains, just visible 
where the sky meets the land. Flora and fauna are sporadic around
the area, patches and clumps of trees and bushes scattered here
and there, and the odd bird and mammal can be seen also. Much of
the grass is crushed, withered, blackened or browned, or 
otherwise littered by the wreckage that covers this field. 
Bodies, pieces of artefacts, gigantic mechanical creations, 
bubbling chemical spills all mark the plain, and in the distance 
the clang of arms can still be heard.

   Black obsidian walls, roof and floor make up this room, the
light, coming from nowhere corporal, moving in odd patterns
along the surface. Along this hallway are dozens, scores,
hundreds of shelves and boxes, containing all sorts of items
and materials. Stretching as far as the eye can see, or perhaps as
the brain can understand, a light breeze flows through here,
bringing with it the smell of crushed grass.

A Hazy, Smoke-filled Flat~
   Small and dark, this chamber is laden with a rich, heady smoke
that seems to cling to every available surface as well as the open
air. Compromised of two walls covered in bamboo panelling, reddend
brick and mortar make the eastern wall and the northern consists
of a length-spanning yellow-tinged window. Past it, one may see
an urban view of night in St. Louis from a few hundred floors up.
Dark and dreary, the skyline is dotted with the beacons and lights
from nearby skyscrapers as well as several lines of white and red
ants marching to and fro upon the interstate. The ceiling, amazingly,
is vaulted and rather Byzantine in appearance. Tastefully sculptured
minarets and spires twist down from the domed ceiling, their glass
surface luminescent and softly churning in different colors. Made
of dogwood the polished floor is glossed to a high shine, its
surface redounding the only light source in the room, the varied
blurs and swirls of color from the ceiling. In its dark and dim
atmosphere, the only missing piece is that there is no door.

shelves~
A series of massive, sagging bookshelves line this wall, most of 
which seem to be gradually bowing under the heavy load of books
that are crammed into every concievable inch of space. Virtually
no organizational system is appearent and the topics of the works
range from Linguistics to Philosophy. An entire row seems dedicated
to a complete folio set of The Collected Works of St. Augustine,
all bound in contemporary calf and bearing an incunabulistic date
of publication. Directly beneath them is a full row of textbooks
on Japanese linguistics, with random Kanji cards shoved in at uneven
intervals. Other works of note include Machiavelli, Hobbes, Doyle,
George Martin, Tolkien, Savanarola, Murasaki, Brendan Behan, Joyce,
Gaiman, Nietzche, Tolstoy, and cache of pre-15th Century shipping
manifests marked with the stamp of the Knights Templar.

desk~
This desk is carved of solid oak and seems to dominate much of
the room with its prodigious size. In the center of the desk is 
a battered, smoke-stained computer monitor, its dull glow penetrating
the dim haze of the room like some luminescent island in a swirling
sea of folders, files, papers, paperbacks, and overflowing ashtrays.
One side of the desk holds a sprawling wooden piperack, each slot
neatly filled. The pipes within encompass a broad spectrum of styles
and makes, ranging from Savinelli tulip briars to Ser Jacopo Palo 
Ortos, hitting GDB, Dunhill, Alpha, and Brumsfield down the line.
The area next to the terminal is lit by a small, covered student
lamp. The lamp's dim glow further reveals a tarnished St. Cristopher
medal to be dangling from the stem.

A Dark Chamber~
   Sand, as dark as a moonless night, smothers the stone floor as 
a thick blanket. Muted flashes of colour lay strewn throughout 
the languid black, dyed granules of sand, while scattered 
fragments of opaque obsidian disrupt the pervasive shroud with 
their sinister sheen. Swathes of dark cloth envelop the walls 
consuming their form completely leaving only a vague impression 
of the rectangular depth of the chamber. The tenebrous hangings 
mute the distant din of the 'rinth to a barely audible whisper, 
perceptible only in the thickest of silences. The oppressive air 
is thick with the pungent smell of lingering clove incense vainly 
attempting to overpower the underlying stench of decay and rot.

A Marbled Office~
   Made of solid white marble, the steadfast floor is refined 
with a lustrous polish that gleams in the pale light of the glow 
crystals. Rising with perfectly straight posture, the protective 
black walls stand guard all around the chamber eternally vigilant 
in their duty. A desk made of deep maroon wood and topped with 
an onyx surface reigns from its position before the eastern wall. 
A comfortable chair padded with black suede rests with stately 
poise behind the desk, while two slightly smaller chairs sit 
before it. In each of the corners an obsidian candelabrum rises 
alertly, casting their watchful pale gaze over the chamber. The 
walls are lined with banners made from woven silvery linen, 
emblazoned by raging red scorpions and paintings depicting scenes 
of glorious battle. A deep archway resides within the powerful 
western wall, providing a soldier's guard for the stout wooden 
door. In the southern wall another archway leads out onto the 
roof, a lattice of oak and pine forming the entry.

   Soft blades of grass form a seductively dulcet carpet that 
spreads across the ground in a sculpted rectangle. Small stones 
of black, jagged and rough mark the boundary by their silent 
guard. Smooth cobblestones form the rest of the courtyard, 
broken only in two places by the gnarled trunk of huge, towering 
trees. The brownish grey bark twists and curves with ancient 
growth rising with majestic grace to spread its massive branches. 
Subtle hues of green depict the twisting of leaves, catching the 
faintest breeze to rustle calmly.

The Sanctuary of Telperion~
   This cavernous chamber's vaulted, arched ceiling fades away 
above the observer into clinging shadows, and sounds echo with a 
deep resonance throughout the area. Hewn of solemn charcoal grey 
marble, the floors glimmer with reflected torchlight. A huge, 
breathtakingly detailed stained glass window has been set into 
the northern wall, its colors ablaze with the perpetual twilight 
of Telperion's radiance. A large, stately desk has been 
positioned directly beneath the scintillant vista, facing the far 
end of the Hall, barely visible in the gloom. The cold stone 
walls are covered by filled, ancient bookshelves of immense 
stature, the sea of tomes occasionally broken by a large tapestry 
or mural depicting some long forgotten historical scene.

   These incredibly vivid tapestries, woven solely of the

and other less-identifiable presences that one can only
surmise to be Valar lend the Sanctuary the weight of the
ages, and any who pass into this place beyond time the
impression of history's panorama as a frozen moment.

sheaves of parchment, tablets, and many other even more
eclectic trappings. Every now and again you spot something
even far more unusual, hinting at the purpose of this room's
primary occupant; strange, glowing sigils, indecipherable
strings of 1s and 0s, mysterious platters of a distinctly
mirror-like substance, and others, even less identifiable.

The Room o' Outfitting~
   By being here, you, the player, are no doubt currently being 
customed outfitted by an immortal. What is meant by that is the 
generic starting equipment is deamed not quite right for your 
char, and a few things need to be changed. 
   Don't be afraid to ask for something, or make your own 
suggestions! However, asking for a full suit of mithril plate 
mail or a flaming magical sword will probaly earn a spot of 
smiting. Please remember that we try to make characters balanced 
from the start. 
   Also, if you have any problems with your skills, descriptions, 
statistics or anything else now is definently the time to ask. 
Thank you, and prepare for the world of SoI. - Zapata

The Hallway of Rogues People~
   Here is a list of the NPCs in this room. Use at your own 
will, but leave a note on the Rogues_Org board. Thanks. 
   a twitchy, aqua-eyed man - Ianon is a general thief with some 
basic lockpicking skills, rather cowardly. 
   a malnutritioned teenager with green eyes - Brea is a general 
thief / catburgular who's extremely street smart and good at 
surviving. 
   an unwashed kid with mousy hair, a stringy youth with dirty 
blonde hair and an auburn-haired, agile child - 
   Turps, Challish and Ember are three of Albero's messengers. 
They don't have many other duties except to look for information, 
and are moderate pickpockets and sneakers. All run from trouble. 
   a weather-beaten man - Names Hart, currently wanted by the 
guard for smuggling. He's lived an awful long time in his 
profession and has little mercy. 
   a rat-faced, ebony-haired young woman - Nera is the fellowship 
rat to the Minas Tirith guard. Nervous, and only gives out 
information at the latest moment of useful use.

The Quiet and Serene Sanctuary of Chade~
   Stained oaken walls and glossy floorboards add a feeling of 
warmth and coziness to this room. A long book case, packed to 
the brim with novels and tomes that line the northern wall, as 
well as a large, oaken desk sitting in the middle of the room 
suggest that this is a study. Sconces holding flickering candles 
light the room, basking it in a natural glow and casting odd 
shadows. A huge fireplace dominates the eastern wall, roaring to 
life as light fingers of smoke billow up its chimney shaft. A 
blue silken curtain drapes across the western wall, separating 
this study from the next room.

Chade's Playboy Mansion~
   The walls and ceiling of this room have been painted a plain 
white colour. Plush red carpeting lines it, extending to the 
narrow skirting boards. Silver chandeliers hang from the 
ceiling, bathing the room in a bright, golden glow. Naked woman 
parade about, oblivious to the prying eyes of voyuers who happen 
by. A blue silken curtain drapes across the eastern exit, 
obscuring your vision. Set into the middle of the northern wall 
is an arched, oaken doorway.

The Museum~
   Flawless limestone bricks create the walls and ceilings of 
this spacious room. Its floor consists of plain, glossy white 
tiles, and a single strip of red carpet runs from the entrance to 
the end of the room, separating it into two equal halves 
Completely lining each wall is an array of glass cabinets, oaken 
shelves and racks, containing a variatable treasure trove of 
objects. The room is illuminated by a gargantuan fluroescent 
light fixture in the centre of the ceiling, casting its white 
glow into every corner. Set into the middle of the southern wall 
is an arched, oaken doorway, sporting a huge silver knocker 
resembling a lion's head, a ring of metal looping through its 
open jaw.

Nyia's Domain~
   A thin layer of mist hovers in the moist air, tendrils rising 
from the richly verdant earth. The melodic chorus of birds and 
other tropical creatures fill the air, dimmed only by the nearby 
rush of what sounds to be a waterfall. A myriad of ancient trees 
soar upward, majestic branches outstretched forming a lavish 
canopy overhead. Thick vines twine their way up many of the 
trunks, tapering once reaching the branches to dangle a few 
scarlet-blossomed fingers below. 
   Barely discernable through the dense vegetation, a faint path 
leads northward towards the sound of water.

Secret Glade~
   Lush foliage veils this tiny glade, alluding to the aura of 
mystery that lingers here. A small, yet steep, cliff rises to 
the east, water toppling from its rocky peak into a limpid 
bluish-green pool below. Fish of every hue imaginable can be 
seen darting to and fro in the water's depths, many straying to 
the tree-shaded edges. Dwindling off from the pool, a stream 
winds its way west into the jungle, quietly babbling to itself. 
Wild orchids bloom from the surrounding plant life emitting a 
euphoric sweetness that permeates the air. 
   A tenuous path leads south into the dense vegetation.

The Museum's Foyer~
   The absolutely cavernous central foyer of the Museum is a 
sharp contrast to the smaller, more intimate jazz club set in its 
northern wing. Fashioned of gleaming white marble lent a 
softened, bluish hue by the tastefully-arranged lighting 
fixtures, the walls are adorned by various paintings and murals 
depicting scenes from Middle-earth. Gracefully fluted columns 
form a ring about the very center of the foyer, where the 
mirror-like, smoky grey marble of the floor has been inlaid with 
a huge, painstakingly-etched map of Arda. 
   An arch to the north leads to the Museum's jazz club; ornate 
double doors set to the east bear a silver sign etched with the 
word 'History', and to the west, similar doors have been labeled 
in large letters with the word 'Peoples'. To the south, a pair 
of imposing double doors have been set.

Exhibit, the Years of the Trees~
   Long before the Elves awoke, Yavanna created the Two Trees of 
Valinor to give light to the realm of the Valar. We are not told 
how long this time lasted, however, it is widely held that it was 
a period of 10,500 years or so. It was during this period that 
Aule made the Dwarves, and set them to sleep until the arrival of 
the Elves. When Melkor, with the aid of the spider Ungoliant, 
destroyed the trees and cast Valinor into darkness, he stole the 
Silmarils, the prized creations of the Noldor. Feanor, their 
leader, led his people from Valinor into Beleriand in pursuit. 
When the Years came to an end, the Valar crafted the Sun and Moon 
from the remains of the Trees, giving light to the world; thus 
began the Years of the Sun, and the First Age.

been set into both the northern and the southern walls.

Exhibit, the Race of Men~
   The youngest of the races of Arda, with the possible exception 
of the Hobbits, the first Men awoke in the eastern land of 
Hildorien as the Sun first rose and the Noldor returned from 
Valinoar. Seeing the sunrise, many of the first Men set out 
westwards, and so came eventually to Beleriand after some three 
hundred years of wandering. Of all the races in Middle-earth, 
Men are unique in possessing the Gift of Death, by which they 
leave the world after an allotted time and go beyond it. 
   Perhaps more than any other race, the Race of Men contains
many different strains and varieties, from the tall and graceful
Dunedain to the large, powerful, and dark-skinned Haradrim.
   To a great extent, the story of Middle-earth is, to the
surprise of many of the elder races, the story of Men...

Exhibit, the Race of Hobbits~
   The Hobbits, a mortal race almost certainly related to Men,
are of unfortunately obscure origin. Their most distinguishing
feature is their short stature; even the tallest Hobbits rarely
exceed four feet in height. They are also known for their cheery
dispositions, their unceasing appetite for life's small
pleasures, and their stealthiness in movement.
   Originally a widespread people, Hobbits were found in much of
the north of Middle-earth and down the Vales of Anduin. As the
Third Age progressed, however, they moved north and west,
eventually founding the land of the Shire in the year 1601.
   Generally very attached and loyal to their homes, most Hobbits
are loathe to travel, but some, fortunately for the free peoples
of Middle-earth, might very well choose to break that mold...

Exhibit, the Race of Elves~
   The first Elves awoke by Cuivienen, the Water of Awakening
in the far east of Middle-earth, long Ages before the Rising
of the Sun or Moon. Unlike Men, the Elves were not subject to
illness or death, and by the time of Shadows of Isildur, there
were still at least two Elves in Aman who had awoken in the
first days; Ingwe, Lord of the Vanyar, and Olwe, brother of
King Elu Thingol. Their memories were long, indeed.
   Although, unlike men, the Elves must remain in the world
until its ending, they are not bound to Middle-earth. They
may, if they wish, take the Straight Road, and sail into the
Uttermost West, a journey that is barred to mortals.
   Their longevity grants the Elves a wisdom and serenity
that is unseen in any of the mortal races. Their senses are
far clearer and more acute than those of any other race,
and their craftsmanship is the subject of many legends.

Exhibit, the Race of Dwarves~
   Unlike Elves and Men, the Dwarves are not Children of Iluvatar;
they were created by Aule the Smith, though Iluvatar granted them
life. Aule made seven Fathers of the Dwarves, and these slept
through many ages until after the Awakening of the Elves. Almost
all the Dwarves of Middle-earth were descended from the eldest
of the Seven Fathers, Durin the Deathless.
   Like Aule their maker, the Dwarves delighted in smithcraft
and stoneworking; they mined and worked metals throughout the
mountains of Middle-earth. The Dwarves kept themselves apart from
the other races; their language, Khuzdul, was a closely guarded
secret, and they told their true names to none but themselves.
   Though they live much longer than Men (usually around 250
years), Dwarves are mortal creatures. What happens after their
death, though, is a mystery. The Elves have said that the Dwarves
return to the stone from which they were made, but the Dwarves
themselves hold to a differing belief.
   According to Dwarvish tradition, they are gathered by Mahal
(their name for Aule) in a part of the Halls of Mandos set aside
for them. After the end of the World and the Last Battle, they
say, they will assist Aule in the rebuilding of Arda.

Exhibit, the Race of Orcs~
   Little is known for certain of the beginnings of the Yrch,
the footsoldiers of the Enemy. It is said that they were in
origin corrupted Elves captured by Melkor before the beginning
of the First Age. In appearance, Orcs were squat, swarthy
creatures. Most of them preferred the darkness, being blinded
by the light of the Sun, but the strains bred later in the
Third Age, such as the Uruk-Hai, could endure daylight.
   The Race of Orcs encompasses many varieties, from the
diminutive Goblins to the powerful and terrifying Uruk. Also,
a few others that are not properly Orcs are grouped here,
commonly known as orc-kin; trolls being a primary example.
   A creature often found in close proximity to Orcs is
the Warg, an intelligent and malevolent sort of wolf used
by the smaller members of this Race as a mount.

Exhibit, the Race of Ents~
   The mysterious Ents are, so to speak, tree-shepherds; trees 
inhabited by spirits summoned by the thought of Yavanna to be the 
guardians of the olvar until the Dominion of Men. The nature of 
the Ents was closely connected with that of the trees they 
protected and the tree-spirits they guarded. The Ents awoke at 
the same time as the Elves; the Eldar gave them the desire to 
speak and taught them Quenya and Sindarin. In the First Age the 
Ents roamed through Beleriand and the eastern lands, although 
they enter into history only once, when they helped destroy the 
Dwarves of Nogrod who sacked Menegroth. 
   Sometime in the First or Second Age the male and female ents 
became estranged; the Entwives crossed Anduin and tended to the 
smaller plants, while the male ents tended their larger trees, 
in the great forest that stretched from the Old Forest to Fangorn. 
   In the Third Age the Ents remained in the Forest of Fangorn, 
growing old without hope of having children. Some of them have 
grown 'treeish' and ceased moving, or speaking.

Exhibit, the Race of Dragons~
   The Dragons are mighty reptilian creatures who ranked among
the most feared of the servants of the Dark Lord. Of their
origins, no tale tells; the first of them to be seen was
Glaurung, Father of Dragons, who first issued from Angband in the
middle of the First Age. After Glaurung came many others to
strike fear into Elves and Men for the next three ages; among
them were Ancalagon the first winged dragon, Scatha who dwelt in
the cold northern wastes, and Smaug, last of the great dragons.
   Dragons have powers of intelligence and speech, and many are
also able to cast the dragon-spell, a bewildering confusion that
affects any who gaze into the eye of the creature.

Exhibit, the Ainur~
   The primordial spirits, who existed with Iluvatar, and with
Him created the world through the Music of the Ainur. After the
creation of Arda, many of the Ainur descended into it to guide
and order its growth; of these there were fifteen more powerful
than the rest. Fourteen of these great Ainur became the Valar,
or Powers of Arda. The fifteenth, Melkor, turned aside from that
path and became the first Dark Lord.
   The many lesser Ainur that accompanied the Valar into Arda
are known as the Maiar, and include the Istari, or the Five
Wise Ones, of which Gandalf was one, and the ancient and
feared Balrogs, demons of the Ancient World.
   Among the many Ainur that entered the World long ago, there
was one of the order of the Maiar named Melian. Alone of all
the Ainur, she wedded one of the Children of Iluvatar, King
Elu Thingol of Doriath. From her, a strain of the Ainur entered
the bloodlines of the Elves and Men, passed down through
generation after generation; still present, somewhere, today.

   This colossal ampitheatre could easily seat an innumerable

center, even the tiniest of whispers, to reach anyone seated
above quite clearly. Wrought in its entirety from the gleaming,
silver-veined white marble that comprises the rest of the
Museum, its sea of seats are upholstered in crushed velvet
dyed a deep indigo hue. A domed ceiling arches high above,
and countless lamps provide a soft, clear illumination.

It ended with the War of Wrath, the destruction of Beleriand,
and the final defeat of Morgoth, the Dark Lord.

Faelan's Study~
   Cluttered to the point of being almost maze-like, this room 
has the look of a library or a museum. Finished simply with a 
large oak desk and two comfortable-looking chairs, this place 
must be someone's office. Lining the walls is a multitude of 
shelves, stuffed to the bursting point with books, manuscripts, 
and loose pieces of parchment. Stacks and stacks of large, 
leather-bound tomes have been left on the floor, creating 
somewhat of an obstacle course between the door and the desk. 
All of these things combined gives the room an odor of slightly 
mildewed parchment and a stuffiness that most would find 
unappealing.

A Seaside Grotto~
   Tucked into the rocky bluffs lining the southern parts of the 
beach, this spacious, low-ceilinged cavern appears to be a 
dwelling of some kind. The single room is roughly circular and a 
little less than two dozen feet in diameter. Reflections of the 
ocean's water are cast on the walls near the front of the cave, 
rippling lines of turquoise light. In the back, a small 
freshwater spring flows from a crack in the ceiling, forming an 
ovular pool. Some writing has been scratched onto the wall near 
a stone slab.

A Sandy Beach~
   Pale sand covers the ground as far as the eye can see, dotted 
with various seashells of all colors and shapes. Northward, a 
calm ocean stretches out to the horizon and birds wheel about in 
the air currents overhead. The beach comes to a stop to the 
south, where it meets a series of low cliffs that curve slowly to 
the northwest in a half-circle. A wide, arched opening in the 
rocks can be seen from here. Just west of the opening is a 
narrow crevice.

Draxx's Lounge~
   It's a lounge, not much different then any other lounge, 
except it seems to divinely graced. Spirits of Middle-Earth past 
and present seem to move about, conversing with other spirits. 
Some figures are recognizable, others are not. They move about, 
talking softly, as the sounds of smooth jazz play in the 
background. A massive dias sits to one corner, where a desk sits 
atop, with a chair behind it. 
   There seems to be no walls, no floor, no ceiling, merely 
empty, open space, leading in all directions. A swirling portal 
sits on each wall, leading off to a destination throughout 
Middle-Earth, and the divine world around it.

A Terraced Cove~
   The walls of this cove gently curve upwards, ending short so 
as to leave a wide opening where the ceiling would otherwise be. 
Sunlight streams down through the opening, illuminating a thin 
layer of sand spread out across the ground and the numerous 
terraces cut into the southern and western walls.

Inside Orden's Cozy Beaver Dam~
   This room is dome shaped, its thick walls formed from many 
long sticks or branches, varying in shape and size. Closer 
inspecion of the branches show each one has been sharped to a 
point by a beaver's teeth and each seemingly appear to have been 
almost hand placed. The rest of the area consists of a muddy 
floor, showing many sets of tracks, made by some type of small 
creature. The only source of light comes from a large pool of 
water in the centre of the room. Closer inspection of the water 
shows it's actually a underwater tunnel leading down.

Kaese's Workshop~
   This is a long rectangular room, seemingly carved out of 
stone. The surfaces of the room are not exactly smooth, faint 
markings of the instrument used to crave out the room have 
created a strange pattern in the stone of the walls, floor and 
ceiling. Along the two long walls, large shelves have been 
attached and built in. While there is no visible light source, 
the room is filled with a diffuse and faintly orange glow. A 
faint humming fills the room, just barely perceptible.

Along a Sandy Beach~
   Pale sand covers the ground as far as the eye can see to the 
east and west, dotted with various seashells of all colors and 
shapes. Northward, a calm ocean stretches out to meet the 
horizon, while a tumble of large, wind-worn stones form cliffs to 
the south. A narrow, winding path works its way upward from the 
beach, disappearing behind a rocky outcrop.

Built from fine colored crystal, this bottle appears to be

silver. The bottle is wide and round at its base, and narrows

Trail Climbing the Cliffs Above a Beach~
   Winding at a slight, upward slope as it climbs through the 
cliffs, this faint trail is a mixture of earth, loose gravel, and 
sand. Below and to the north lie a long, pale beach that 
stretches east and west before the ocean. The pathway continues 
southwards a ways, then bends around a tall boulder behind which 
the faint sound of gurgling water can be heard.

Bend in a Trail Through the Cliffs~
   This faint trail is a mixture of earth, loose gravel, and sand 
as it travels through the rocky cliffs, winding this way and 
that. A healthy brook runs from west to east, just off to a side 
of the path. It travels downwards to the east, breaking off into 
separate rivulets as it tumbles over various rockfalls. Birds 
wheel about overhead and occasionally make their nests amongst 
the bluffs.

A Small Waterfall Over the Rocks~
   Rising up to the west is a sheer-walled section of rock, over 
which pours the clear waters of a wide brook. The waterfall 
forms a sparkling, ovular pool at the base of the overhang, 
before continuing in its flow to the east. Carefully hewn into 
the stony wall to the west of the falls is a set of even stairs 
that climb upwards. 
   An oddly shimmering patch of mist floats to the north, its 
distorted dimensions shifting and altering constantly, making it 
difficult to look at for long.

sprout in clumps around this plateau. The ground is of solid 
rock, a light brown hue, that has been swept smooth by 
innumerable ages of wind and water. A breathtaking view of the 
ocean can be seen from here, its calm azure waters stretching 
boundlessly to the north. To the south, a cobbled pathway leads 
up to two-storied building, while stone stairs lead downward to 
the east past a waterfall.

Cobbled Path Before a Patchwork House~
   This neatly paved walkway leads up to a rather strange-looking 
house that sits upon a flat portion of the cliffs. Lining the 
path on either side are bits of colorful wildflowers and hardy 
scrubs that grow during all seasons of the year. The building 
itself appears to be constructed from a patchwork of 
architectural styles from various time periods, though its most 
prominent feature is a perfect dome that rises up from the 
center.

A Carved, Marble Hallway~
   Footsteps echo faintly in this corridor of fine marble, carved 
meticulously to form an arched ceiling and fluted columns along 
the walls. The floor has been polished to a gleaming shine and 
reflects the warm light of flickering torches. To the north, a 
set of glass-paned double doors opens out to the front of the 
house, while the hallway continues southward to a large, round 
room.

Domed Hall in the Center of the Building~
   Like the hub of a great wheel, this hall lies in the center of 
the building with marble archways opening into hallways that lead 
off in all cardinal directions. The ceiling is a swirling, semi- 
transparent surface comprised of mystical colors that shift in a 
slow, circular pattern. High above, the vaulted arches of a 
great dome is visible through the mists.

A Dank, Meeting Hall~
   This simple room within the ancient, ruined tower has walls 
covered in moss in an intense state of disrepair. A single 
throne sits at the end of the room with a large, orange fur throw 
rug right before the throne for those who visit the lord of the 
tower to kneel upon. The walls are painted with images of 
carnage, the death of mighty heros orc and human alike. The 
skull of some massive beast lies against the east wall, the empty 
eye sockets staring out in a hollow fashion.

An Old, Tower Archive~
   Series upon series of bookshelves and archives containing 
ancient knowledge stolen from a hundred different realms decorate 
this place. It is clear that whatever entity has chosen to dwell 
here in this ruined tower makes up in knowledge and their thirst 
to collect in what they lack in good taste. A single desk 
remains in one corner made of dragon glass, otherwise known as 
obsidian. A heavy layer of dust hangs over this place making it 
nearly impossible to breath at points.

   The walls of this room are surrounded by maps, trophies and

broken fragments of clay have been shattered and tossed around 
the room in a haphazard fashion. The walls of this chamber 
appear to be made of pure obsidian, and it is clear that this is 
some sort of planning chamber for whatever fiend has inhabited 
this abandoned tower.

A Sandy, Sea-Side Path~
   A narrow, snake-like path extends from the south, running 
along the edge of the glittering ocean to the northeast, bordered 
by a sheer cliff-face to the west. Rocky overhangs loom 
ominously above, worn smooth by the wind, and glistening with the 
ocean's spray. The pathway is soft and wet, littered with dozens 
of pebbles, shells and smooth stones. To the north the path 
continues, leading into the mouth of a grey stone cave from which 
a strange light eminates.

A Starlit, Domed Cave~
   A thin trail of sand from the south fades into a sea of rock 
as a vast cave reaches up from the shoreline, its walls worn 
smooth as silk. Thin, sharply-cut crystals are embedded in the 
stone of the enclosure, their pale surfaces aglow with the light 
of a simple brazier set alone in a corner of the cave. Each 
luminous glint is directed upward to the opal black apex of the 
cave's ceiling, creating a beautiful rendition of the night sky. 
In the center of the room sits a cluttered desk and a chair, 
their shadows falling effortlessly to the curved floor of the 
cave, pitch black under the myriad of starlight above. A great, 
Canadian flag is hung over the mantle of a fireplace set in the 
northern wall of the cave, billowing softly.

An Island Floating High Above the Ocean~
   An immeasurable distance below you, the ocean stretches out as 
far as the eye can see to merge with the horizon on all sides. 
The island itself looks to be no more than a few hundred feet in 
diameter, and its jagged earthen bottom resembles nothing more 
than a chunk of earth torn out of the ground. Atop this unlikely 
plot of land is a lush carpet of vibrant green grasses, with 
bright wildflowers adding splotches of color throughout. 
   An ancient, gnarled willow tree grows in the very center of 
the island, its trailing leaves rustling in the slightest breeze.

   The actual size of this space is difficult to determine, but 
one gets the sneaking feeling that it can expand and contract by 
need or will. Other than the myriad shimmers of multi-colored 
portals to various dimensions, it is relatively unremarkable. 
The surfaces are all constructed of smooth grey marble. 
   A crimson portal to the Gothakra caves swirls overhead.

   A swirling silver portal leads to Eradan's Batallion.

   Rather unkempt, at first glance this room appears not to have 
been used recently. However, upon further inspection, the odors 
and sounds indicate otherwise. Food is strewn amongst the 
furniture, some fresh, some otherwise. A good deal of dirt and 
trash is ground into the beige carpet, and the sky-blue-painted 
walls are scratched slightly. A few rust-brown waterspots are

Thorolf's Grand Hall~
   This is a huge room, extending for many leagues before 
stopping, just barely keeping in sight of the opposite wall. All 
throughout this large room are huge cylindrical shaped pillars 
extending endless miles, far into the sky, so far in fact that 
the roof cannot even be seen. The room is very open and provides 
one with ample opportunity to move about. 
   The double doors to the room are massive, standing hundreds of 
feet high, and many feet thick. The walls are covered thick 
panels of polished walnut, giving this place a rustic, yet 
extremely elegant design. The only places one should watch where 
they walk is in the middle of the hall, where there is a large 
deep pit, and on the eastern wall, where there is a large black 
void.

The bloody fights that are seen go all day long, until one side finally comes out victorious.

An Abandoned Tract of Moorland~
   Stark, bone white grasses sway restlessly in the wind, hemmed 
in by grey woodlands circling from the northwest around eastward 
to the south. Overhead, the sky is a dull grey, obscured by a 
layer of clouds that blot out the warmth of the sun. The ground 
is damp and spongy, sucking at the feet of unwary travelers as 
though trying to drag them down into the murk.

Outside the Back Door of a Farmhouse~
   Four warped, wooden steps lead up to the back door of this 
run-down house. A shutterless window is set in the wall to the 
right, an occasional flicker of yellowish light visible from 
within. Cutting a relatively straight line westward is a 
heavily-trodden pathway that runs toward a barn a short distance 
down the hill.

A Narrow Passage~
   Dim and narrow, this hallway serves as an entranceway to the 
house and a place to hang one's outer garments. The air and 
walls are chill from the drafts of cold air that come through 
cracks in the doorframe to the south. A steep, ladder-like set 
of stairs that hug the western wall leads up to a dark landing on 
the second floor, while thin doors open up to a kitchen to the 
east and a parlour to the north.

A Wood-Panelled Kitchen~
   Scuff marks are well worn into the floorboards of this room, 
proving it to be one of the most highly trafficked in the house. 
A window set in the southern wall looks out onto snow-covered 
fields and the downward slope of a hill. Heavy, timber rafters 
support the ceiling, cobwebs hanging from their joints.

An Old Parlour~
   This room appears to see little use, a layer of dust settled 
upon the floor and its sparse furnishings. A worn carpet is 
spread across the center of the wood-planked floor, though its 
patterned colors have long since been washed out by overexposure 
to the sunlight. Arranged along the walls are padded chairs and 
couch, antique in craftsmanship and bearing a silent dignity with 
their age.

while a pair of doors face each other across the hallway, leading 
into separate bedrooms.

A Sparsely-Furnished Bedroom~
   This barren room holds only the most essential of furnishings 
for a bedroom. Dust lingers in the air, made visible by the pale 
light that streams through a window on the southern wall during 
the day. The ceiling is slanted, its lowest point over the head 
of a bed pushed against the eastern wall.

A Small Bedroom~
   Though smaller than its counterpart across the hall, this 
bedroom has a cozier feel to it. A narrow bed is arranged with 
its head against the northern wall, with a wooden trunk at its 
foot and a chest of drawers a few paces beyond the trunk, pushed 
against the southern wall. There is little space to maneuver, as 
this room can house only one person comfortably.

On the Front Porch of a Farmhouse~
   This rickety front porch sees little traffic, evidenced by an 
undisturbed layer of snow that blankets its surface and railing. 
A dead cucumber vine hangs from the railing, which starts at the 
eastern end of the porch and runs along the northern perimeter. 
The vine itself is withered and blackened, its shriveled leaves 
crumbling at the slightest touch. Wooden stairs descend to the 
west, where a trail leads away from the house.

On a Path Between a Barn and a House~
   The path takes a bend here as it passes a small barn to the 
west and a ramshackle house to the northeast. A layer of snow 
covers the ground, hard-packed and churned by sleigh runners. To 
the north, a smaller trail breaks off and heads along the side of 
the house.

Along the Side of a House~
   Goose-berry bushes line a narrow path that runs along the side 
of a house directly to the east. A pair of small windows are set 
in the wall facing outward, their glass panes laced with frost. 
Both the house and the path are near the top of a hill, the 
frozen landscape falling away to the west while a barn is visible 
not far to the south.

Dirt Trail Leading Up to a Farm~
   Cresting the top of the hill, this trail leads up to the front 
porch of a ramshackle, two-storied farmhouse to the east. A dead 
cucumber vine dangles from the railing, its blackened leaves 
contrasting against the white blanket of snow it rests upon. 
While the trail ends at the foot of the porch steps, a smaller 
one breaks off to the south where it continues along the side of 
the house.

   A number of stalls are lined up against the far wall of this 
barn, though only a couple appear to be occupied by the beasts of 
burden they are intended for. Dry straw has been strewn across 
the wood-planked floor, soaking up any mud and melted snow 
tracked in from outside. Some oil lanterns hang from the low 
rafters overhead, providing ample lighting for the room.

ceiling is extremely high, and made of arched stone. It almost 
looks as if if was carved directly out of a strong mountain, 
rather than built with stone blocks.

simply an extensive corridor of pure white, doors set into both 
the north and south of it every so often. Light floods into the 
corridor from nowhere, casting out almost any possibility of 
shadow. The doors are unmarked and seem to all be the same. A 
trapdoor is set into the top ceiling here, and the corrdior comes 
to an end to the east.

Mir's Unique Plot NPCs~
   A sweeping chamber of metallic colours sprawls out here, 
several tubes and pipes running from one end to the other. The 
ceiling, somewhere high above, cannot be seen for all the dozens 
of wires, tubes, pipes, and hoses that hang from it and stretch 
across the length of the room. Blackness envelopes the floor, 
and even though there is no light, there is also no darkness; the 
room is a paradox in that everything is visible with no sources 
of light. A number of cryogenic tubes line the walkway through 
the blackness, containing a plethora of humans and other 
creatures in a state of stasis.

A Misty Corridor Leading Off Into Obscurity~
   Making one's way through this corridor is akin to moving 
through a dense, multicolored fog. Tendrils of it swirl up at 
every footstep and twist to mimic the flow of the air currents, 
mutating slowly when disturbed by a breath. Occasionally, the 
fog clears, showing an opening of some sort, and far to the 
south, it clears enough to leave a glimpse of a sunlit, coastal 
area. The rocks of a cliff are barely visible, from which 
cascading waterfall splinters into a thousand rainbows whenever 
the sunlight hits the spray of droplets, which dance up as the 
fall pours onto the rocks below.

   The ground underfoot is composed of greyish marble, oddly

multicolored fog shrouds the walls and the rest of the corridor 
beyond the immediate area. Tendrils of mist swirl up at every 
footstep and twist to mimic the flow of the air currents, 
mutating slowly when disturbed by passage of a body or exhalation 
of a breath. In various locations, the mist is clear enough to 
reveal a tiny door or portal, leading to destinations unknown.

smoothness of the northern wall, and to the east, a grand arch

wall. To the north, a large, clear glass window provides a view 
of a pathway lined with flowers and trees, and further out, a 
coastal cliffside, the horizon eventually merging with the 
greyish-purple of the distant sea. A wrought-iron chandelier 
hangs from the ceiling, the waxen candles burning with a strange, 
fey-like bluish light.

leading into seemingly alternate realities. Towards the south  is
Dravage's spiked castle, looming high in an omnious black color.

Before a Maliciously Spiked Wall.~
   In every direction The tall walls of a compound block travel. 
Dark menacing spiked iron juts out at every angle along the wall. 
The mangled twisting metal has been sharpened and prevents any 
chance of climbing or scaling the walls. To the south is a heavy 
steel gate that has been chained and locked many times over. 
Strange engravings on it maar the surface. In the middle of the 
short grassy courtyard before the compound is an ancient stone 
well. A tattered old rope tied to a peg drops down into the dark 
black of the well.

The Great Hall of Valhalla~
   This hall is incredibly vast, stretching as far as the eye can 
see. Five hundred and forty doors line the panelled walls into 
the distance, any noise echoing ominously through the vaulted 
chamber. Far above, one can see that the rafters are actually 
spears, and the roof is a dome of roundshields and bucklers 
covered in Norse designs. Benches line the floors, rusted and 
battered breast-plates scattered on them. Valkyrie messenger 
spirits in bright armour constantly ride through in the air on 
immense, dusky wolves and ravens, conducting the souls of slain 
heroes into the great hall. Voices seem to emanate from the 
walls, the seemingly endless chamber never free from the whispers 
of those passed on.

Before a Menacing Spiked Castle.~
The spikes adorning what seems to be every inch of free surface on the 
exterior of this castle are as plentiful in sizes as in directions. Twisting and
biting at the air they maliciously reach out with a jagged unkind sharpness
that seems to desecrate the very surrounding area with a morose feeling
of unimportance. The savagery glitters black all over, a crystal clean pitch
color that seems depthless and entrancing at the same time. A high archway
leads soutwards into the foyer while a gate blocks the road northwards when
closed.

In the darkness of the walls what looks like the glint from reflective and
peering eyes flash occasionally but never long enough to be seen.

hundred-story, needle-like spire on the northern pole of the 
Death Star battle station. A circular viewport with a web-like 
framework provides an amazing view of the station below and the 
blackness of space beyond. Beneath the viewport and dominating 
most of the room is the grand dais upon which the emperor's 
throne chair is set. The dais is bordered to the south with dark 
metal railing except for the broad stairs leading southwards and 
down. The stairs join with a narrow walkway which spans the deep 
shaft that drops down the length of the spire and to the 
powercore of the station far below. The throneroom is painted in 
dull grey and midnight blue, with the exception of several 
red-blinking computer screens and control panels.

Inside A Small, Wooden, Two-Wheeled Cart~
   The inside of this cart is quite cramped and can hold only a 
person or two at most. The wood of its construction is old and 
weathered and the cart itself creaks as it moves.

Inside A Wooden Two-Wheeled Cart~
   This cart appears large enough to hold three or four people 
comfortably, though any more and it would be considerably 
cramped. Constructed of wood, the cart seems fairly well-made, 
though it creaks when significant loads are placed inside and 
while it travels.

Inside An Ornate Carriage~
   The inside of this carriage is luxurious in its decoration. 
Panelled with beautifully-stained cherry, the walls of the 
carriage are as smooth as glass while the door and window frames 
are accented with brass trimmings. The seats, arranged facing 
one another, are large enough to hold two people in each and are 
upholstered in rich-burgundy velvet. The carriage is completely 
comfortable to ride in and as a mode of transportation, the 
pinnacle of extravagance.

Narrow Walkway Across a Deep Shaft~
   This room has no floor, for it is in the middle of a wide 
shaft that plummets straight down the centre of the command spire 
all the way to the battlestation's central power core. Spanning 
the shaft from north to south, and east to west is a narrow 
walkway of black durasteel with waist-high guardrails. The 
walkway circles round a turbolift set in the very centre of the 
shaft, and in all directions each branch stops before a security 
door, except to the north where it leads to the throne room. The 
lighting is dim, the walls are dark and the atmosphere sinister. 
Be careful you do not fall.

Lord Daerodon's Meditation Chamber~
   The walkway over the core shaft passes through a security door 
and leads into what appears to a meditation chamber. Beyond the 
walkway itself, the room is dark with high walls and to the east 
a circular viewport with a web-like frame looks out over the 
vastness of space beyond. In the centre of the room is a black 
spherical, specially pressurized hyperbaric capsule equipped with 
its own medical facilities. It also contains a viewscreen and 
holographic projection pod - and a jacuzzi!

Lord Daerodon's Medical and Torture Chamber~
   The walkway which spans the core shaft passes through a 
security door and leads into what appears to be a medical and 
torture facility. The walls and floor are the same midnight 
blue, lending the chamber a very eerie atmosphere, which is 
augemented by the many strange and painful instruments of 
medicine and pain about the room. There is an examination bed in 
the centre, complete with binder to hold patients and victims 
down. Consoles in the walls and table are equipped with 
articulated arms and claws. There are no viewports in this room, 
but many security cameras, and the door is magnetically sealed.

Lord Daerodon's Personal Shuttle Bay~

compromising the atmosphere within. The bay itself is large 
enough for a few small craft to be docked in it at once. Steps 
lead up onto the main floor which is marked out with glowing 
lines. The ceiling is high above and the dark walls are covered 
with blinking lights. This is the emperor's personal hangar.

   This room is rather spartan in design and layout. Built to be 
functional, this room serves as basic housing for the arena's 
gladiators. The floor is marred and scratched, and only the 
tiniest bit of light filters in from the outside through several 
cloudy windows. The smell of sweat and blood pervade the area.

pitch blanketing their entirety. The floor is similarly carved,

were illuminated by the noonday sun. However, all else is devoid 
of definition and light. Objects stand on a floor which is 
nonexistant, doors stand in nonexistant walls, the entire place 
seems infinite and without form. In this place there are only 
two things: substance, and void.

A Treetop Lair~
   Hundreds of feet above the ground, this treetop lair seems 
quite precarious. No railing is present, though the platform, 
made of wooden planks, seems sturdy. The platform has been built 
against the trunk of an enormous tree, a person not being able to 
fully grasp its width without traversing around its trunk. 
Additional platforms can be seen to the west and south, though no 
bridges span the distance, only a myriad of vines that hang 
between can be seen. An enormous door is set into the tree to 
the north, and an odd blue glow pulses above.

The Bridge of the U.S.S. Enterprise, NCC-1701~
   No doubt about it, this is the bridge of the one and only 
Constitution Class Federation Starship U.S.S. Enterprise, 
NCC-1701. Roughly circular in shap, this walls are lined with 
various consoles and screens bearing status readouts and 
schematics. The floor is raised about the perimeter of the 
bridge and lined on the inside with support railings. Inside the 
railings the floor is recessed slightly, forming a circular 
command area which is accessable via three sets of steps arranged 
on the north, east, and south. On the western perimeter of the 
command area the raised perimeter floor juts out into the command 
area, forming the platform upon which the captain's chair is set 
along with two stations for helm and navigation. The two 
stations face a large wall-to-wall viewsceen on the northeastern 
wall. Along the outside perimeter of the bridge, running along 
the wall to the right of the western entrance, are the stations 
for communications, science, and various other vital ship 
operations. Set into the western side of the bridge is a set of 
Turbolift doors which grant the only entrance and exit from the 
bridge.

Cramped, Wooden Sideroom~
   Now, this room is just downright creepy. A number of personal 
affects are strewn about, but they certainly don't belong to the 
owner of the equipment 'round here. Cameras have been set 
against the east wall, tiny holes cut to allow them to view the 
room over there. 
   Clothing articles abound in plastic-wrapped packages, ranging 
from jeans to shirts to undergarments to shoes, though all seem 
to be specifically designed for a female. 
   Food strewn about the room would probably allow one to remain 
here for quite some time, if they did so desire; a bedroll on the 
ground allows for one to even sleep here.

Captain's Quarters~
   A relatively large room, this cabin is wood-panelled, the wood 
stained and well-varnished. Portholes in the port and starboard 
walls allow light into the cabin, though lamps hung on the walls 
also provide illumination. A bed is bolted to the cabin floor 
along the port side while a table is secured on the starboard. 
Set in the middle of the cabin is a desk, a cabinet and a plaque 
affixed to the wall behind it. The room is clean and well-kept, 
generating a feeling of the essence of order.

Passage Below Deck~
   This short corridor leads fore and aft. The bulkheads are 
quite spartan with little ornamentation aside from lanterns 
hanging along the corridor to provide light. On either end of 
the corridor and along both sides can be found doors. Each door 
is set above the deck so that one must step over the threshold to 
enter. Up above, a hatch leads to the main deck of the ship.

Ship's Hold~
   A large room, the ship's hold is filled with barrels and 
crates. Some of it is cargo, some of it is supplies. Lining the 
bottom of the hold and extending below the rest of this deck is 
the ship's ballast. Quite spacious the hold allows the transport 
of significant amounts of cargo. A large door in the aft 
bulkhead affords access to and from the hold to the rest of the 
ship.

   A fairly large room, this is the ship's galley where the 
crew's meals are prepared and served. A stove is mounted to the 
floor along one side of the room, flanked by cabinets and a 
counter while a table and chairs occupy the opposite side. A 
vent in the ceiling allows smoke from the stove to escape to the 
deck above. The galley is quite neat and organized and smells 
pleasantly different from the usual odor of brine throughout the 
rest of the ship. A door toward the bow leads out of the room.

Climbing the Mainmast~
   Climbing the mainmast, one rises high above the deck of the 
ship. The mast is thick, and features small wooden rungs 
attached to it to help one climb. The ship's main sails hang 
from wooden spars extending port and starboard from the mainmast. 
High atop the mast sits the crow's nest, a pole extending out 
from its center upon which flies a series of flags. To the 
stern, the mizzenmast rises from the deck.

nest. It is large enough for two people, though a bit cramped. 
Rising out of the center of the crow's nest is a twenty foot pole 
from which fly several flags. From here, one can see out above 
the sails and across the horizon in every direction. To the 
stern, the mizzen mast rises, but from this height one can still

Port Crew Quarters~
   This room, located on the port side of the ship is fairly 
large yet nevertheless cramped due to the presence of numerous 
bunks. Because it's along the side of the ship, the room tends 
to sway more than it would if it were in the center of the 
vessel. As a result, anything hanging from hooks on the wall or 
the bunks tends to swing back and forth. Housing half the ship's 
crew, these quarters afford little more than sleeping space, 
though an occassional group of sailors can be seen sitting on the 
edge of the bunks chatting with each other across the narrow 
aisle between them. A single door in the starboard bulkhead 
affords access to and from the room to the rest of the ship.

The Great West Road~
   A number of the tiles that compose this length of the Great 
West Road have been bleached bone white by the sun, lending a 
unique depth of hue to the highway. The road sags into the 
occasional depression here, small potholes trodden into the 
predominantly flat face of the highway by heavy traffic. The 
faces of some of the flagstones of the thoroughfare here are 
speckled with lichen, others spotted with patches of grey-green 
moss. The intermittent traveller can be spied crossing the road 
here infrequently, often arriving from lesser paths and arteries 
that intersect with the main highway. Thick flagstones of pale 
limestone have been fitted together to form the road underfoot, 
hammered firmly into the hard earth below. A general curve of 
the Great West Road begins here, the causeway arching from east 
to north.

The Aft Deck~
   Situated atop the sterncastle, this small deck houses the 
tiller. A wooden railing extends around all four sides of the 
deck, except for two openings along the fore section where 
ladders afford access to and from the main deck. Astern lies the 
tiller and the ship's compass. From here, the ship's direction 
is controlled. A large flag of Gondor flies from a spar 
extending off the stern of the ship, flapping in the breeze.

An Ornately Decorated Office~
   A thin crimson fog lingers throughout this room, a precarious 
melody reverberating throughout it non-stop. A slight hint of 
blood floats about the air giving an omninous feel to the room. 
The layout of the room is curious, an old style setting that 
coincides even with the coloring of the air that lingers, red 
carpeting, as well as red painted walls. Various weapons from 
different time periods are strewn about the wall, carefully 
placed and hung. The only noise that can be heard is the 
continuous violin-chello duo amidst the foggy atmosphere, not 
even the sound of footsteps emit from the earth.

precarious melody barely audible sneaking in from the adjacent 
room. The floor is solid marble, with a flowing crimson carpet 
leading into the room to the west, walls and a ceiling completely 
absent only a pitch black void remain.

   If you are here, then you have most likely selected a special

the time constraints on immortals, they may not have the time to 
see to you personally, and so will have loaded the equipment your 
character requires as well as set the appropriate skills and 
clannings of your character here. 
   Once you are done equipping your character, simply type 
commence. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to 
email them to the staff email account, staff(at)middle-earth.us.

The Blazing Pit of Hell~
   All around this room, flames burn fiercely in all hues of red, 
orange, and yellow, from crimson to goldenrod, with some edging 
on blue in hue. Where there isn't fire, the pit is bathed in 
darkness, the light of the flames occasionally flickering in to 
reveal horrendous, twisted, and greusome creatures. In the 
center of the pit sits a dais, wreathed in flame; on it sits a 
throne of stone, black as night and deathly cold even in the 
searing temperatures. 
   What sits there would be a truly horrible sight, one that no 
one would survive unscathed.

   This room is completely black, with no sign of any entrance or 
exit in the completely solid walls. Despite this, a haunting, 
eerie glow fills the room, lighting it up. The floor is cold to 
the touch, and very hard, while from the walls a strange warmth 
emanates. They are sticky to the touch, and once touched with 
skin they seem to wobble and sway in the direction pulled. 
Upwards the eerie glow fades, and nothing can be seen but utter 
darkness leading far up.

Atop the Castle Foyer.~
Here the area's of Dravage's empire split for the quests
and mobs that are important, right?
Ergo to the east lie the Rogues Halls, and to the West
Lie the Halls of the Odd.

The Rogue Room.~
   Driya: A Mid-Level Rogue, she is often used by the 
organization to take information back and forth between the MT 
rogues and the Osgiliath ones. Very adept at keeping alow 
profile, her skills in actually stealing from another have never 
been strong, but it's her ability to get into almost anywhere 
silently that is her greatest asset. The Rogues Also recognize 
the fact that she will do things that are necessary, including 
killing another with a swift swish and a gurgle to be heard and 
nothing more.

A Laboratory Workroom~
   This room is kept very well lit by the florescent lights in 
the ceiling. Anything but claustrophobic, this spacious room is 
given an even larger feel by the glass walls surrounding it. A 
couple of counters bearing many scientific instruments lie on the 
outside of the room, while the center of the room is dominated by 
a large layout table with a florescent glow emanting up through 
its translucent surface.

Grissom's Office~
   This office is anything but neat and organized. A set of 
steel shelves has been erected in the middle of the room, home to 
many jars of gruesome-looking specimens kept in sealed glass 
jars, the most interesting of which appears to be a fetal pig 
suspended in a liquid of a greenish tint. A desk resides near 
one wall, piled high with papers and presents an aura of mayhem. 
Against one wall are a few sets of bookshelves, each bearing many 
volumes of scientific texts, a large amount of them related to 
the study of entomology. Though the room contains an air of 
eccentricity, it is nonetheless inviting.

A Stark Hallway~
   This hallway is always busy with the bustle of lab personnel. 
It is kept clear of obstructions, and the white tile floor is 
always kept to a brilliant polish. The surrounding walls are 
mostly made of sterile metal and glass, allowing easy viewing 
into other areas of the lab. To the north is the entrance to the 
lab and reception desk. A laboratory workroom lies west, and a 
curious office is through the eastern doorway.

A Chamber Inside Amon Rudh~
   The walls of this room are of stone, perfectly straight and 
without any fissures. The walls are utterly unadorned, save a 
few sets of manacles which chain various mobs. Looking at the 
mobs, you realize that they are Dregor's NPCs for his plots, and 
figure it might be best to leave them to him. A barred iron door 
is set in the western wall, a well-lit office visible. A wooden 
trap door in the center of the room can be opened, revealing a 
dark chamber beneath the floor.

   The five of them should be able to take an equal number of

barely through the thick metal.  All else here is darkness.

wood and set about a pair of similarly framed silver-handled
doors. The interior walls are neatly hewn and the floor is

Inside a Turbolift~
   The turbolift is cylindrical in shape with smooth interior 
walls of slate-grey hue. It is easily large enough to hold a 
dozen or so people. The turbolift is designed to transport 
personel to various levels of the ship with incredible speed. 
Inertial-dampeners and acceleration-compensators within the 
lift's systems prevent the occupants from feeling anything more 
than a slight tremour as the turbolift moves. Glowpanels across 
the ceiling provide ample light and down the wall beside the 
hatchway is a series of buttons with digital writing next to each 
one, describing each possible destination.

A Private Room in Club Endore~
   Set aside for the private use of Club Endore's preferred 
clientele, this spacious sideroom shares the elegant mahogany 
panelling and plush dark carpeting of the rest of the 
establishment. Rich bronze sconces bearing muted lamps cast the 
area in a comfortable, low lighting. The air bears the faintest 
hint of the soft jazz melodies wafting through the thick walls 
from the main area of the club, and occasionally muted bits of 
conversation may be heard. The walls are lined with large glass 
picture windows, providing a breathtaking view of the star-filled 
void, and far, far below, the brilliant jewel-blue of Endore. 
Ornately-panelled double doors lead out into the hallway that 
will return one to the main area of the club.

An upside-down office~
   This is a large, utilitarian office, decorated in a tasteful 
fashion. It is, however, upside down, with all the roof fixtures 
on the floor, and visa versa, and everything on the walls the 
wrong way up. A black-and-white, chessboard like pattern of 
marble runs along the roof, with a solid oaken door extending 
downwards on the western wall. In the middle of the room, a 
large crystal chandelier pokes up from the ground, its various 
dangling bits pointing straight up in a law-of-gravity defying 
display of sheer nonsense.

A Shoddily-Built Tree House~
   Built right into the boughs of a mighty, if ancient, oak, this 
tree house has been constructed with shoddy craftsmanship. The 
floorboards are rickety and sometimes shift when a foot is poorly 
placed. A round hole has been cut into the floor and several 
bamboo sticks wrapped in leather serve as a trapdoor. There are 
no windows to speak of but large, airy gaps can be spotted 
sporadically around the walls and when the wind blows, drafts can 
be felt coming from several directions. A curtain of loosely 
stitched animal skins conceals the western half of the tree 
house.

A Small Side Room of the Tree House~
   This section of the tree house is smaller, warmer and any 
drafty holes have been sufficiently boarded up. One of the thick 
branches that make up the oak protrudes through the eastern wall 
and out through southern one, leaving a cozy nook in the corner. 
There are no windows and a large curtain of poorly-stitched 
animal skins gives the room a sense of privacy and seclusion. 
The room's ceiling slopes down sharply with crude construction, 
most likely the result of building around the formation of the 
tree.

The Trunk of an Ancient Oak Tree~
   Nailed crookedly up the trunk of this old oak are a number of 
unevenly spaced wooden slats that form a makeshift ladder leading 
to the sanctuary above. The tree itself is roughly fifteen feet 
in circumference and its gnarled branches sprout and twist in all 
directions. The bright, healthy foliage above spreads out into a 
thick crown that keeps the area shaded and cool. A sea of fog 
that obscures everything and anything is all that can be seen for 
miles around. If desired, one could descend further down the 
tree trunk and into the fog, but the unearthly silence and 
stillness below induces a feeling of unease.

A Trapezoidal Tower Room~
   This room cantilevers out from the core of the tower. It is 
roughly trapezoidal with its inner and outer walls parallel. The 
outer wall is almost completely covered by a bank of windows that 
stretch nearly from floor to ceiling. Shading the windows from 
the outside are broad horizontal slats of weathered bronze 
embossed with geometric figures. This room's ceiling is tall and 
smoothly plastered, and the floor underfoot is made of smoothly 
polished concrete stained Cherokee red. The inner wall is 
plastered as well, with a rough, sand-textured finish. #2A large

This painting, in a heavy frame with beveled corners, depicts
a rugged mountain-scape dominated by a sky full of raging
storm clouds. The clouds that shroud the highest peaks are lit
with a multi-shaded red glow as is from the setting sun. Bolts
of lightning arc down from clouds to strike the mountains
below. After a moment, the mountains and clouds seem to shift
and reveal the form of an enormous, red-bearded man looming
over the landscape, smiling broadly, and looking directly out
at the viewer with eyes lit with fierce joy.

toward a tiny stage. Surrounding the stage are rows and rows of 
seating. The stage is the only thing in this room that is 
illuminated as searchlights, mounted all across the vaulted 
ceiling direct their glow upon it. The stage itself is quite 
tiny and is meant to be the world upon which TybCo Action 
Figures(c) may strut and fret their hour upon and then be heard

floor is a slight off-white in color and remarkably clean, 
indicating that this hallway probably doesn't see extensive use.

   Cozy and warm, this room is the perfect setting in which to 
catch up on some reading in ones spare time. A large lucid LCD 
viewscreen dominates the northern wall, depicting a pristine view 
of a green pasture, fluffy clouds overhead casting perfect 
shadows upon the ground below. Beginning in the northeast corner 
of the room, huge floor-to-ceiling oaken bookshelves are set 
against the wall. On the eastern wall of the room a gap in the 
bookshelves frame a huge granite fireplace which provide the room 
with warmth and light. The bookshelves sontinue along the 
eastern, southern, and western walls, flanking a large recessed 
archway in the western wall, which provides access to and from 
the room through a set of great oaken doors.

from wooden spars extending port and starboard from the mainmast. 
High atop the mast sits the crow's nest, a pole extending out 
from its center upon which flies a series of flags. To the 
stern, the mizzenmast rises from the deck.

Rising out of the center of the crow's nest is a twenty foot pole 
from which fly several flags. From here, one can see out above 
the sails and across the horizon in every direction. To the 
stern, the mizzen mast rises, but from this height one can still

   This room, located on the port side of the ship is fairly 
large yet nevertheless cramped due to the presence of numerous 
bunks. Because it's along the side of the ship, the room tends 
to sway more than it would if it were in the center of the 
vessel. As a result, anything hanging from hooks on the wall or 
the bunks tends to swing back and forth. Housing half the ship's 
crew, these quarters afford little more than sleeping space, 
though an occassional group of sailors can be seen sitting on the 
edge of the bunks chatting with each other across the narrow 
aisle between them. A single door in the starboard bulkhead

A Corridor That Gets Smaller And Smaller~
   This seems to be a perfectly ordinary corridor, having a 
neatly (if somewhat drably) carpeted floor, plain skirting 
boards, largely unadorned walls and only one door, right at the 
westernmost end. The difference with this corridor, however, is 
that it seems to stretch on for an incredibly long way when one 
looks at it in a westerly fashion. However, upon traversing even 
a short way, one notices that the corridor does not in fact 
stretch for very far at all, but rather gets smaller and smaller, 
until reaching the door at the very end which is scarcely large 
enough for an adult male to crawl through.

Aboard a Battered Vessel~
This ship has been planked with battered boards of oak and pine,
and sealed with tar pitch. The wood is dented and splintered, and
scar burns mar the deck. Toward the stern, there's a hatchway
leading down into what looks to be the captain's quarters. The
mast is centered, towering above the sloop, and draped in tattered
grey linen sails.

The Captain's Quarters~
The interior of this room, much contrary to what the ship's hull
would lead one to believe, is posh and comfortable. The walls are
richly-stained, and the floor is actually carpeted in the finest
Haradaic fashion. The room's window has been created in the shape
of a skull, and looms over much of the ship's stern. A chandelier
of beaten silver hangs from the ceiling.

A Deep, Windy Pit~
   This is a deep pit, looking naturally formed rather than dug. 
The walls are rough, craggy red stone, sloped inward so as to 
make escape impossible. Far above, turbulent black clouds roil 
amidst a blood red sky, tossed by the same howling winds that 
shriek and whip about, sending dust flying.

Valarauka's Hall~
   You stand in the centre of a ring of light, beneath the 
pressing darkness of a cavernous room. What little light there 
is comes from a rough circle of fire, which flares up between 
cracks in the ancient stone floor around you, casting a 
flickering light over the immediate area. Monolithic pillars, 
etched with strange runes, are just visible, rising upwards far 
beyond the reaches of the light. The air feels oppressively 
thick and is filled with the odour of ages past, faintly 
accompanied by the smell of burning. There is a deathly silence 
cast over the area, even the slightest of sounds being quickly 
consumed by the surrounding deep.

An Incredibly Impressive Wedding Chapel of DOOOOOOM!!!~
   This Chapel is SO impressive that it overwhelms your 
squigglyspooch, causing you to be so in awe of people that can 
afford to have a wedding in such a chapel that it's just not 
cricket. In fact, you could say it is the single most impressive 
feat of impression you have ever had impressed upon you in your 
entire life (which now seems quite worthless merely in comparison 
to the few moments you've spent in this Chapel). Truly 
impressive.

interrupted only by two triangular windows, cut into the wooden 
frame. The windows are curtained with short velvet strips, held 
fast with golden tassle. Beneath them, the square doors of the 
vehicle are quite clear, banded by silvery metal as they are. 
The carriage is complete with two pillowed benches set on either 
side of the interior, as well as a luggage shelf above and a 
liquor chest of mahogany near the right door. The vehicle could 
comfortably sit four passengers, with enough room for the storage 
of a few belongings.

secure by rusty nails that keep them firmly down. The main sail 
flutters overhead, the mast directly in the middle of the deck. 
A door is set fore in the sterncastle, ladders flanking it on 
either side which lead up to the aft deck, and sturdy-yet-old 
wooden rails flank the sides of the boat. The ship creaks a bit 
as it bobs in the water. A small crew of sailors busily move 
about the deck, checking rigs and performing other tasks.

A Cargo Hold Turned Quarters~
   Tightly fit planks, caulked and sealed, make up the floor and 
walls of this room. The looser planks above and the regular 
supports spaced through the room imply that the room was 
originally designed as a cargo hold, but has been efficiently 
altered to make it simple sleeping quarters for several 
individuals. The ever- present creek of wood on wood is about 
the only sound that generally makes its way into this otherwise 
quiet room and its original design as a hold makes it wider than 
you would expect of a sleeping berth.

In a Small Crow's Nest~
   The main mast narrows slightly, barely supporting the weight of
the circular platform perch near its top. Well above it, there's
room for the ship's flag to fly, with a flag-rope connected to a
swivel at the very top of the mast beneath a finial. The platform
itself is made of sturdy treated greyish-brown wood, roughened by
sea air and water, and it's not entirely snug against wind. It'd
reach about waist-height to most people, with a ledge all around
it to lean on if desired. It rocks and heaves with every motion of
the ship below, but despite the instability it affords a spectacular
view of the surrounding area and of the deck that looks entirely too
far down. A rope ladder leads down the mast, with patina'd bronze
footholds sunk into the wood at regular intervals.

Climbing the Mast~
   A single rope ladder climbs up the main mast of the ship, 
leading eventually to the crows nest high above. Surrounding it 
are all sorts of rigging equipment, from ropes to chains. The 
mast is very thick, and tends to sway every time the large 
triangular sail catches wind. The rope ladder continues as it 
climbs the mast, with footholds sunken into the wood in even 
intervals.

well as a few pieces of furniture if needed.

Aratar's Ice Throne~
This large iceberg expands several hundred yards in all directions
from its center. It floats in a bone-chilling cold ocean that
carries on as far as the eye can see. Beautifully, the blue seas
crash against the pure white of the ice and snow. At the northern
end of the berg, the ice rises high into the air, forming a small
mountain. Atop the highest point rests a large throne made of
crystalline ice. The throne over looks the entire berg, which 
is pristine in creamy white, untouched snow.

Aratar's Kanagaroo Room of Doom~
   This large area is a massive field sparsely dotted with various
trees. The air is rather dry, making it cool dispite the hot sun
beating down on the land. Wildlife is spread abundantly, and 
gathers near the trees for shade. A small pool of water near
the center of the field gives a fresh drink to any who are brave
enough to vinture out from hiding.
   Kangaroos can be seen copiously about. Some taking the time to
keep cool in the shade, while others search about for food and
and water.

The Gondor Room of Luck and Study~
   If your character is in this room, then their intelligence or 
aura is high enough to have warranted them extra study, 
knowledge, fate, or sheer blind luck, manifesting itself in the 
option to buy and select options and items not available to the 
average Minas Tirith player. Anything your character 
purchases here, they are assumed to someone have stumbled across 
it in their travels before arriving (you will need to make up a 
backstory behind whatever you find here).
   #3IMPORTANT:#0 Type "Scribe" to see a list of possible scripts in 
the game. Please carefully match these against the items in the 
shop. If you purchase a script, you -must- first have the 
Literacy skill learned. If you did not choose the literacy skill 
in character generation, you must first purchase the literacy 
skill, then use the command to learn it, before you can correctly 
buy a script. 
   Once you are done here please continue by moving north - simply type "#3n#0" or "#3north#0".

Gondor Starting Points~
#6East - The Wizard's Cafe#0

A frequently inhabited, higher-class inn on the Third Tier of 
Minas Tirith. While it receives visitors from all classes, it is 
commonly a position for the wealthier in society and a place for 
business meetings to occur.

#6West - The Other Side Alehouse #0

A frequently inhabited, reasonably respectable tavern on the 
Second Tier of Minas Tirith. While not as upmarket as the 
Wizard's Cafe, it is still another recommended place for the new 
player. 

#6North - Wardog's Inn#0 

A tavern in the Pelennor fields north east of Minas Tirith, 
mostly frequented by Villeins of Lord Astirian, rather than those 
from Minas Tirith. It is located due north of the Great Crossing 
which is just outside of the Minas Tirith city gates. It is not
as full as the other two, but a good starting location for
players who are not based in Minas Tirith.

and brackens growing alongside a running stream of icy-cold 
water. Equip yourself for the long journey ahead and carry the 
proud history of your people with you.

the Dunedain. Before you is a kinsman attending to laden stalls 
of equipment. Prepare yourself before continuing on the great 
traditions of the Men of the West. Here you can buy clothing for 
men, while the vendor to the east sells clothing for women. To 
the west, race-appropriate jewelry and accessories are available.

Lounge~
   This square room is small but not overly so. In the air is the
smell of age; musty and slightly dank, and the effect this creates
is only added to by the appearance of the room. Wall paper, faded
and peeling, has been pasted to the wall in years gone by, and is
of a 70's, snot-green, flowery design. The carpet on the floor was
once thick and at the height of fashion, but it is now worn and the
snot-green colour is oh so outdated.

  As far as the eye can see, beautiful white crystalline sand 
meets cool, tranquil blue waters. The sand feels soft and cool
under a person's feet while the gentle waves of the ocean
climbing up the shore makes for a truly peaceful setting. An
occasional bird singing in the distance is the only thing
which breaks the natural calm. To the west, the ocean seems to
continue on forever, meeting the clear blue skies. The sun
shines constantly here, keeping it picture perfect at all
times. A gentle breeze keeps the area cool and makes it
perfect for relaxing.

A Dense Mallorn Forest.~
   The sand from the south starts to end and grasses and shrubs

dominate the area. Each tree appears thick, likely being countless
years old. Their golden leaves glisten in the sunlight. Many
animals scatter about the forest. Birds can be heard about the
forest, though the echoing of their songs makes them next to
impossible to locate.

   Deep in the dense canopy of the tallest trees of a jungle has 
this elaborate, well-furnished tree-house been constructed and by 
the looks of the banana peel strewn on the floor, it's inhabited 
by a monkey. What appears to be the foyer of this treetop house, 
has been constructed from fine planks of wood from the 
surrounding forest area. There is no glass in the windows to 
allow in the calming, tranquil forest sounds -- save for the odd 
grazing deer that's ravaged by panthers. A tall roof stretches 
high overhead and comfortable furniture has been spread carefully 
at various points around this entrance room to welcome guests. 
Most noticeable of all, a number of wall-hangings, drapes and 
posters have been tacked to the wood walls to give it a homely, 
decorative appearance.

The Deep Breath Before the Plunge~
   Welcome to Gondor! If this is your first time playing a MUD, 
or Shadows of Isildur in general, type HELP NEWBIE for an 
overview of basic commands that will come in very handy during 
your time here. However, we also have an extensive new player 
guide here: http://www.middle-earth.us/playerguide/Default.htm 
   You are about to start your journey in Gondor. If you did not 
take a special role, you will begin in the Pelennor fields, just 
northeast of Minas Tirith, in the fertile hunting and farmlands 
of Anorien. You will be entering a tavern called Wardogs, where 
you can buy food and drink, read the gossip board ("look board"),

Room 2 of the Gondor Pregame complex~
   You're almost there! Before you continue, however, please make 
certain no items are in either your left or right hand, or in 
your boots. Once you pass this room, you'll be fine to replace 
them. You will now probably go straight to the Battered Shield 
Tavern just inside Minas Tirith in the south east corner of the 
Sun Plaza. An employment board is posted there for you to 
browse. If you are of a special race, you will now be sent to 
the appropriate race room first.

A large, posh doghouse~
   Lost in near infinite plains below and endless sky above, you 
can feel viscerally the raw size of this world. You know that 
the wind buffeting you has traveled lifetimes to cross the 
endless sky. Scattered about the hills are the remains of cast 
off gear lost from some ancient travelers. Other piles are 
composed of unidentifiable bits and pieces of a coders nightmare. 
Lost bits, dangling pointers, and vast drifts of unclaimed memory 
extend as far as the eye can see.

A Poorly-Lit Condo, Room 221B~
   This condo probably costs quite a bit of money in rent, but 
only the size and reasonable repair of the fixtures gives any 
evidence to that effect. Square, with a high ceiling, the front 
room is packed with boxes, personal effects, old furniture, and 
stacks of heavy, leatherbound books. Bookshelves, constructed 
variously of metal, hard, modern-looking plastic, and unadorned 
wood line the walls, and they are themselves choked with books, 
compact discs, DVDs, and miscellaneous musical and academic 
accessories. Illumination from overhead is usually missing, but 
a collection of ill-matching lamps of several types located here 
and there through the room make it possible to see when 
necessary.

The Swampy Ruins Of a Manor (Eldritch's Room)~
  Wild swamp has overgrown the ruinous remains of a manor or villa
that once stood on these murky grounds. Fog spreads over the moist
muck-heaped bogland, pools over dark water pooled in sunken pits.
Most of the foundations have toppled, gray block stone littering
the place in heaps. One section still stands somewhat at the top
of a hillock. A statue lies broken in pieces, the base having been
chiselled with the name Ashia.

Lobby of Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, NJ~
   Built on a spacious campus and recently remodeled, this 
hospital is clean, modern and productive. Flurries of controlled 
chaos enliven the tastefully decorated lobby as doctors, 
patients, visitors, and, occasionally, emergency personnel cross 
between the entrance the elevators. A wide, square intake desk 
dominates the center of the room, manned by overworked but 
stubbornly civil nurses, while similarly square pillars mark off 
the length of the space in yards to the north and south.

A Messy Apartment~
   This apartment is of moderate size, the walls painted an 
eggshell-white in color while the floor is covered by a plush, 
burnt-sienna carpet. Shelving and a couch dominate the entire 
southern wall while placed immediately before them, hanging above 
the small fireplace is a 42-inch flatscreen plasma HDTV. A small 
black entertainment center has been set to the side of the 
fireplace and T.V., a karaoke machine and a few video game 
consoles carefully placed within. On the kitchen countertop, a 
10-gallon fishtank is displayed with only a single bluish-purple 
betta fish can be seen swimming about through the algae growing 
upon the tank's glass. Books, pieces of unfinished homework, and 
video games lay here and there and upon various pieces of 
furniture , the apartment unkempt.

   The Lost Boys humble abode, this treetop village is built upon 
a towering tree, set within a rocky outcropping just beyond the 
shore of Neverland. A few crudely constructed huts colorfully 
decorated in feathers and vibrant paints and dyes sit among the 
branches, with narrow rope-strapped bridges connecting them 
together. Fixed upon the doorways are plaques featuring the name 
of its occupant: Rufio, Thudd Butt, Pockets Ace, Don't Ask, Too 
Small, Latchboy, and No Nap. 
   Winding through a series of suspended bridges are huts in all 
cardinal directions.

A Peaceful Glade Encompassed by a Serene Forest~
   Surrounded by trees of a soft, silvery hue, this small 
clearing lies within a deep and peaceul wood. It is eternally 
seren and is constantly alight with a soft glow eminated from 
silver-hued trees which loom above the grass floor this small 
clearing. The singular bit of movement present in this place of 
never-ending bliss is a woodpecker and a squirrel, both living in 
the high reaches of a golden-colored mallorn that stands alone in 
solitude at the center of the clearing; its reach is far beyond 
any other in the forest.

Nocht's Originally Titled Room~
   Black marble comprises the walls and floor of this comfortably-
sized room, though it would seem oppressively small if not for the 
clear glass of the ceiling giving view of the sky. A few out-of-
place-looking furnishings are scattered here and there, with some
space left in between them. In one corner of the room is a heavy-
looking trapdoor. Sigils of the night sky have been etched into
the walls and lined with golden ink, making them glimmer in even
the faintest of light.
  More inscriptions have been recently added, giving directions:

A Small Cell~
  This small cell seems to have been hewn from the solid rock which makes
up the walls, ceiling, and floor.  There are no visible seams anywhere in
the construction.  The room is well lit, but there is no visible source
for the light.

Araphor's House o' War~
   You find yourself in an ancient, rubble-strewn house. It 
seems as if the occupants left in a hurry, the only thing visible 
here an ancient desk with the letter A stenciled in black. A 
mound of rubble is strewn in the corner of the house, directly 
across from one of the four shattered windows. Looking down 
provides a view on an old city in flames, the street below a 
ruins of rubble and debris. The entire city seems to be 
constantly at war, troops and clashes visible upon myriad streets 
and alleyways.

Beside a Stripper's Cage~
 #1M#2u#3l#4t#5i#0-#9c#1o#2l#2o#4r#5e#1d#0 strobe lights and a #9#6d#9i#6s#9c#6o#0 ball dance through stale
smoke inside this tall cage. It is large enough to let even the
#9#5leggiest#0 stripper swing on the pole at the center. A #4DJ#0 nearby
plays #9#2jamming#0 music with a #9#3thumping#0 base. In clockwork fashion,
strippers enter the cage to each song and begin their #9#2lustful#0
dance. Each #9voluptuous#0 stripper gives a sexy dance in the cage
before leading gentlemen off into 'private booths'. #5A large,
muscular bouncer#0 keeps a hawkish eye on #1you#0, enforcing the
idea of '#9#3look, #1don't #6touch'#0.

Sedryn's (Not So) Tidy Workshop~
   This builder's workroom is dramatically spacious, well lit and 
has high vaulted ceilings. Along one wall is a massive 
whiteboard, with drawings and sketches arrayed all over it. 
Running along the opposite wall is an assortment of tools, 
ranging in size from a tiny paintbrush to a full up hydraulicking 
rig. A few jello molds of mountains and trees lie forgotten in 
the corner. A line of workbenches sprawl over the center of the 
room, the half-finished projects well lit by sky-lights above.

A Cosmic Rift In Time And Space~
   Stretched out between then and now, scattered with unborn 
stars and swirling galaxies of black holes and finite entropy 
lies a still place where it all began. Stars glitter, and cosmic 
auras colour the voids, while the seeds that will be come the 
consumer in the dark and the flickering lights of awareness that 
will be gods are playing among the hymns of the song of creation. 
A pattern of flaming stars leads to an old wooden gate to the 
east.

great number from freshly cut logs. Not made to stay afloat or 
to last very long, nor have any effort been put into details - 
but they are effective and can serve its purpose well, to carry a 
large force across the great river Anduin. Both lanterns and

runes and glittering with a soft silvery shimmer, while others 
appear to barely be attached to the ceiling. In places there are 
piles of broken rock, and the occasional dried out bone poking 
out from under bloodstained rags. In all directions, openings
lead out of the cavern.

A Cobblestone Street in Minas Tirith~
   The crush of humanity here can be nigh overwhelming, as this 
wide, cobbled street is constantly abuzz with people coming and 
going about the daily errands of their lives. Though occasional 
cast offs and bits of garbage can be spotted underfoot, the 
streets are for the most part kept clean thanks to the dutiful 
work of the Minas Tirith Cityworkers. On both sides of the road 
buildings rise up, their clean, white facades reflecting the 
sunlight pleasantly. Though they have seen the wear of thousands 
of feet, the cobbles below are uncracked and lain with 
remarkable precision, attesting to the skill of those that lay 
them. A wooden sign leans up against the wall of one building, 
near the doorway.

A Busy Stable~
   Scattered about the flooring of this room is a layer of hay, 
thicker in some areas more than others. There are numerous doors 
that give a wide access to the stalls lining each side of this 
building, housing many animals here comfortably. Stacked in 
several places are sets of hay bales just out of reach of the 
horses. To the south, a set of double doors leads back to the 
street. 

  #3Type #6MOUNT STALLION#3 to try to ride the horse. But be careful! 
       He bucks. You can type #6DISMOUNT#3 to get down. 
 The horse will #6HITCH #3to you, but you can type #6UNHITCH#3, too.

   While in a stable, typing #6STABLE STALLION#3 lets the ostler 
exchange the horse for a fee and a ticket. Don't lose it! This is 
 what you use to get the horse back by typing #6GIVE TICKET OSTLER#3.

An Abandoned Building in Osgiliath~
   What might have once been a grand building of stone with an 
arched sweeping roof and marble floors is now only a ruin. Half 
an arch can be seen here, a remnant of undamaged floor there, but 
these are only lonely hints of what the building might have once 
looked like. Now the place stands in utter ruin. The roof has 
collapsed entirely and the remains of it litter the floor, huge 
pieces of rubble in varying sizes from hand sized to the size of 
a grown man. The floor is cracked and broken, with snags big 
enough to catch at the feet of an unwary walker. Along one wall 
hangs shreds of an old tapestry, the head of an armored figure 
visible from one particularly large remaining piece, yet the tone 
and scene of the tapestry cannot be guessed from what's left.

A One-room Cabin in the Birchwoods~
   The floor of this cabin is composed of pinewood planks, 
roughly sawn and held down with thick, heavy iron nails. A light 
coat of varnish adorns the planks, yet their cut is rough, and 
the grain and knots of the wood are easily apparent. The walls 
of the small cabin are thick and round, joined at all four 
corners in the simple, dove-tail fashion. Each crack between 
each log is packed with a thick mixture of mud and moss, keeping 
the room well insulated in the cold winter months. A single 
window stands upon the southern wall, designed to catch as much 
of the sun's light as possible. With no other adjoining room, 
every article necessary for a solitary life is present, shelves 
hammered directly to the walls with function in mind over form. 
A rough, plank door sits in the east wall, simple and 
unembellished, with an iron handle.

An Office of Black Marble and Stone ~
   Stretching out into this marble chamber are well trodden and 
threadbare carpets, the collected dirt and mud tarnishing the 
perhaps bright colours they used to show. Sitting in the middle, 
facing the door, is a large mahogany desk, strewn with papers, 
ink and books. The sturdy chair that sits behind it looks as old 
and distinguished as the darkly woven bronze lightning bolt 
banner it sits underneath. Two bookshelves keep up the flanks, a 
ragged collection of texts and parchments held in the wooden 
constructs. A simple window has been hewn from the eastern wall, 
allowing a few rays of light to stray in and warm the hard blacks 
and greys of the stone office.

vstr #6Subject: #9POSTING POLICIES#0
vbr - 
vstr #0In Shadows of Isildur, there are essentially two types of in-character 
vstr boards that we allow our players to post on in-game.
vbr -
vstr The first are "gossip" boards, often denoted by objects in game such
vstr as a table full of gossiping patrons, an errand boy relaying messages,
vstr and so forth. Posts on these types of boards should be oral in nature;
vstr snippets of conversation that's passed along, perhaps some words
vstr exchanged between a couple of patrons at the bar, and so on.
vbr - 
vstr The most important rule to bear in mind when using these "gossip"
vstr boards is to #1avoid using nameless and faceless vNPCs to convey
vstr controversial gossip or slander#0. Animating and assigning such
vstr opinions to non-players is the province of the admin staff only; if
vstr you are found to be putting words in the mouths of NPCs in such a
vstr way, it will not be looked upon very kindly. Should you wish to
vstr convey such information, you should do it in a manner that is ICly
vstr traceable to your character; instead of "Billy Joe Bob the nameless
vstr patron said...", you should write, "Jane stopped in and mentioned..."
vstr In other words, don't try to duck the in-character consequences of
vstr spreading negative information by using untraceable vNPCs. You can,
vstr however, slander yourself through the use of vNPCs as long as you
vstr don't post anything that would get the NPC into serious trouble.
vbr - 
vstr The second type of in-character board is a more traditional message
vstr board, such as a bulletin board object. Instead of relaying bits and
vstr pieces of gossip or conversations, posts on these boards should
vstr indeed be written as notes. Furthermore, only PCs with the proper
vstr literacy skills should read from these boards or post to them.
vbr - 
vstr Any post placed on the boards in violation of the above policies will
vstr be erased immediately by the admin staff upon discovery, and the
vstr player so in violation will be informed. If it becomes a repeated
vstr occurrence, possible sanctions include loss of posting privileges,
vstr loss of any accrued RPP, or other measures at the staff's discretion.
vstr If you should happen to see a post on an in-character forum you
vstr believe to be breaking these rules, please inform the staff by sending
vstr an email to our staff list at #6staff@middle-earth.us#0.

vstr #6Subject: #9OBJECTIONABLE CONTENT#0
vbr - 
vstr Shadows of Isildur is a role-play intensive MUD, and the successful player here will take vstr that quite seriously. As a result, many and sundry experiences are depicted in the gameworld; not all of these experiences are necessarily pleasant, nor do they agree with everyone's sense of propriety. In order for such roleplay (e.g. roleplayed sex or torture) to proceed, #Fexplicit #0out-of-character consent must be obtained from all parties involved #9(Note that, by definition, legal consent cannot be given by a minor). #0Role-playing scenes which depict child abuse, rape, or sexual torture are explicitly prohibited.
vbr - 
vstr If any of the involved parties withdraws their consent #Fat any time#0, the roleplay #Fmust stop#0, with absolutely #9no exceptions#0. Simply "fade to black", and then roleplay the consequences of whatever activity has been skipped rather than focusing on the activity itself. 
vbr - 
vstr Finally, please remember that we strive to provide a family-friendly environment, and an enjoyable experience for all ages. Therefore, if you choose to engage in any arguably objectionable roleplay, the onus is on you to find a relatively private place in-game for it to take place. If someone should happen upon your scene by chance, travelling through a public area, and they find its content objectionable, #Fyou will be treated as if you consciously chose to involve them in it without first obtaining their consent#0.
vbr - 
vstr Any violations of this rule should #Fimmediately #0be reported to staff. Please be aware that we keep complete logs of all player interactions on our server for just this reason.

vstr #6Subject: #9MULTIPLAYING IS NOT ALLOWED#0
vbr - 
vstr We #Frequire #0that each player stick to a single game account in their time here, so the staff is better able to track their past characters and roleplay. Furthermore, neither multiplaying nor alternative characters are allowed on Shadows of Isildur. Each player may only have #Fone (1) #0character alive and in-game at any one time. If you wish to create a new character before the death of your present one, you must first retire your active PC from the account menu.
vbr - 
vstr If, for any reason, you wish to use a second account from your computer's IP address - such as allowing a sibling or spouse to play, or visiting a friend's house and playing from there - you #Fmust #0clear this with the staff #Fbefore #0doing so. Our IP-tracking system #Fwill #0tag you as a multiplayer, and if you only give us your excuse after you are caught it will not sit well.
vbr - 
All infractions of this rule, whether the registration of multiple accounts or multiple living characters, are punished quite stringently - so please observe this policy carefully.

vstr #6Subject: #9PLAYER KILLING#0
vbr - 
vstr Provided that it is in-character, player killing is allowed on SoI. However, we do ask that you bear in mind that people often invest a great deal of time and effort in their characters; this is not a HnS mud, where once you kill their character they pop up safe and sound at a respawn point. So, please think carefully before engaging in any such activity; often, there are excellent and interesting RP opportunities to be had as alternatives to killing.
vbr - 
vstr Conversely, as a victim, if you feel you are being treated harshly or unfairly by another player-character - chances are #Fyou may be right. #0As long as it occurs during the course of in-character roleplay, however, and does not violate one of the other policies listed here, such is perfectly acceptable behavior. Remember, not all roleplay you come across will favor your character; adversity is a fact of life in Middle-earth just as it is in our own world.

vstr #6Subject: #9CODE ABUSE#0
vbr - 
vstr As hard as I try, the code is obviously far from foolproof. It is, after all, only code; it lacks the sense of judgment that (most) human admins have, and thus will never be as good an arbiter of situations as a sentient being. Those who seek to take advantage of this weakness to accomplish their own ends, whether it's powering up their characters or wreaking havoc on others, will be dealt with quite harshly. Being aware of a bug and not informing the staff, so that it remains for you to exploit, is strictly against our policies.

vstr Unfortunately, it is not always possible to resolve difficulties through discussion, and we are required to take action to see a matter to its close. Although each situation is unique, the following are the general guidelines that we consider when deciding an appropriate sanction for a policy breach, or repeated instances of the same or similar offense: 
vbr - 
vstr #F1st Offense: #0Verbal warning.
vbr - 
vstr #F2nd Offense: #0Minor sanctions, such as a small skill drop/nogain, roleplay point deduction, or short-term siteban.
vbr -
vstr #F3rd Offense: #0Moderate sanctions, such as a more significant skill drop/nogain, roleplay point deduction, or temporary siteban.

vstr #6Subject: #FROLEPLAY POINTS
vbr - 
vstr #FWhat Are Roleplay Points?#0
vstr Over time, players here at Shadows of Isildur may amass units of confidence from the staff we call "roleplay points". They are given out by staff members for various facets of exemplary roleplay, and are used by players in character generation to create new PCs in various restricted roles and races or cultures. The points are stored on your account, so they may transfer from one of your lifetimes into the next; thus, over time you may accumulate more.
vbr - 
vstr As mentioned above, roleplay points are strictly representative of #Fhow much trust the staff places in you as a player#0. They are not indicative of how much we like you as a person, they are not indicative of how long you have played here, nor are they indicative, strictly speaking, of the overall quality of your roleplay. As outlined below, an absolutely stellar roleplayer prone to bouts of retiring numerous PCs or not logging in for months at a time will likely find himself with less roleplay points in the end than a strong roleplayer with a track record of consistent dedication to the game and her characters' roles.
vbr - 
vstr Finally, to re-iterate, roleplay points are #Fstrictly used in character generation#0, to allow players designing new PCs access to restricted races and roles. Once you are finished with your application, they have absolutely no bearing on the game whatsoever - once out of the gate, they are completely irrelevant to your character's fate.

A Dreary Prison Cell~
   This cell of crudely-lain stone is perhaps four feet by four 
feet, barely room enough for one person, and nearly 10 feet deep. 
A putrid, rotting smell pervades the air, and the walls and 
ceiling drip with moisture, mold growing rampantly. A single, 
reinforced trapdoor of wood is the only exit from the cell, 
reached by a few rusting bars in the wall. A hatch in the 
trapdoor allows food and drink to be dropped to the prisoner. 
Far above, a small window, perhaps a foot wide, provides the only 
light to the cell, itself barred by thick rods of iron to prevent 
escape.

vstr If you were arrested, on the other hand, by one of the various NPC Enforcers that patrol the city, they will not respond to your OOC commands, nor to your says.

If this is the case, then you will be released after a set number of hours LOGGED IN. The timer until your release will not count during times when you are logged out, however, so keep this in mind.

A Clearing In The Forest~
   The thick forests of Ithilien surround this circular clearing 
on all sides. Birds chirp brightly in the trees, fluttering from 
branch to branch. Within the clearing, knee-high grass sways 
gently in the wind. Underneath the sea of grass, squirrels, 
rabbits, and other small creatures can be seen darting about on 
their various errands. Occasionally a deer can be seen near to 
the treeline, its brown coat blending in well with the relatively 
dim forest.

Once a weapon has been placed into a sheath (via either #6SHEATH#0 #3or #6PUT#0 #3<#2KEYWORD#3>#0 #6SHEATH#0#3) it can then be 'drawn'. The #6DRAW#0 #3command will make your character draw their weapon already wielded.#0

bandage strip clean white cloth~
vstr #3This item is a bandage. Shadows of Isildur's combat system has been fine-tuned to the point that it is possible to sustain wounds which actually bleed, and will continue to harm your character until the bleeding is halted. While it is possible to stop the bleeding without a bandage, via the #6BIND#0 #3command, it will heal slowly, reflecting the fact that the wound has been staunched only with your hand. If you use the bind command while holding a bandage in one hand, it will take much less of that critical time to staunch the bleeding and will heal faster. As well as this, should you ever wish to flee a battle that you feel you are losing, then you should attempt to use the #6FLEE#0 #3command.#0

A Busy Bridge over River Anduin~
 A high dome of white stone, the mighty Bele-Iant, covers this 
wide bridge, decorated with star-shapes and paint long faded to a 
dull misty-grey. Crossing over the River Anduin below, the slow 
flow of the water echoes about the corridor, adding to the 
general din of the continual throng that crosses the bridge at 
all hours. A recurrent breeze flows up from the river, creating 
a perpetually chilly draft over the bridge. Moss and other 
discarded tidbits clog the sides of the bridge in spots, adding 
to the fallen appearance of this once resplendent structure.

vbr -
vstr #1 1)#3 Clan Notifies: The syntax for a clan notify is #6NOTIFY #3<#2EXAMPLE CLAN NAME#3>, and this will broadcast to everyone that is in that clan that you are online. The output is something similar to this: #6[An average-looking man (Fight The Man!) is ONLINE. Use NOTIFY to reply in kind.]#3 To use this kind of notify, an example syntax would be: #6NOTIFY FIGHT THE MAN!#0.
vbr -
vstr #1 2)#3 Personal Notifies: Personal notifies are issued to a single, targeted player, and alert only that player that you are online, and is usually taken as an indication that you wish to role-play with them. When receiving a personal notify, the output will be along these lines: #6[An average-looking young man is online. Use NOTIFY to reply in kind.]#3 If you receive, or send, one, a personal notify can be read this way: "Hey, I'm online, available, and would like to RP with you. Are you available?" If you are available, you enter #6NOTIFY#3, and they will see the message #6[NOTIFEE IS ONLINE.]#0

A Garden in Upper Minas Tirith~
   Enclosed on all four sides by high walls of white stone, this 
garden is a haven of peace and rest. The sounds of the city do 
not penetrate the enclosed space, and the smell of many different 
flowers overwhelms any lingering smell of dust from the roads. 
Covered in healthy, deep-green ivy, the walls are capped by an 
iron fence, a deterrent to any who would seek entry that way. 
Within the walls, the garden is sectioned off by paths lain of 
black and white stones that circle the grounds and cut in a line 
to the centre from each corner. Where the four paths meet, there 
are triangular, enclosed sections in which a plethora of flowers 
grow. Roses, rhododendrons, lilies and many other plants draw the 
eye with their colourful blooms, all of them meticulously tended. 
In the very centre of the garden where the paths meet is a small,
marble fountain, water splashing up merrily within it and the bowl
engraved with small fish chasing each other around the rim.

Woods on the Mountain~
 This area is mountainous and rocky, with a nigh constant, 
slight slope upwards. Large bits of grey stone jut out of the 
ground at regular intervals amongst the thick green of the 
forest, the underbrush here relatively restrictive to those
who attempt to move through it. The trees themselves seem to 
be mostly birch, glowing close together here in the rough, 
mountainous area. The sounds of the forest pervade--birds 
chirping, quiet rustling of brush, and another natural sounds.

plain yew wood shortbow bow~
vstr #3While labeled a shortbow, the following tutorial applies to the longbows in game as well. The bows in-game needs to first be picked up, and held in either the right or left hand. After that, you will need to #6WIELD#3 the long/shortbow. Once that is done, you'll need to use the #6LOAD#3 command, provided that you have an arrow either in a quiver or in some other container about your form. After that has been done, and you've seen your prey via the #6SCAN#3, you can attempt to use the #6AIM#3 command.#0

quiver black leather~
vstr #3This item is representative of most quivers found throughout the game. Quivers can be worn in one of two places, depending upon which type of quiver you've bought: either the hip, or the shoulder. While quivers are not necessary to using a bow, they do make it a good deal easier.#0
~
P
l look~
sling straps~
#3As well as bows, slings are also available in game to hunt with. While not of much use against armored assailants, they are quite viable when used against small game. The sling as well, after being held in one hand, utilizes the #6LOAD #3command. The sling, however, has an extra step: that of #6WHIRL#3. Aiming with a sling is identical to how to aim with a bow, save that it only reaches one room.#0

P
l look~
throwing knife~
vstr #3The throwing skill was implimented relatively recently into the gameworld and, with it, such items as throwing knives, javelins, and throwing axes. Of the "ranged" weaponry groups, throwing weapons are the easiest to use: simply #6WIELD#3 the item, and then #6THROW #3<#2WEAPON NAME#3> <#2TARGET KEYWORD#3>. Throwing weapons can be thrown a distance of one room in any direction. An example would be: #6THROW DAGGER TWINK#3, or #6THROW DAGGER NORTH TWINK.#0
~
P
l look~
arrow~
#3This is an arrow, which is standard ammunition for both short and long bows. Both bows utilize the same kind of arrows, so you need not worry about buying explicitly shortbow or longbow arrows. The difference between shortbows and longbows is that the first can only shoot two rooms, while the second shoots three, but is less accurate.#0

In a Quaint, Bustling Tavern~
   A smooth lining of oak comprises the floor, though brightly- 
colored rugs cover almost all of the flooring as they're draped 
over one another and crisscrossed here and there. The tables 
have been arranged in a far from visible pattern, though the 
proximity in which they stand gives the room a cozy, intimate 
atmosphere because of that closeness. People bustle through at 
every hour of the day, chatting with companions and ordering 
food and drink.

vstr #3The #6EMOTE#3 command is almost certainly the most important command in Shadows of Isildur, because this is a roleplay intensive MUD.
vstr You can perform simple emotes as well as more complex ones.
vstr #0-#3
vstr Typing #6EMOTE LOOKS AROUND THE ROOM#3 would show: #0You look around the room.
vstr #3To others, it would look like #5An average looking man#0 looks around the room.#0
vstr -
vstr #3You can also 'target' people and objects, though in different ways. The #0(tilde)#3 is used for people, and the #0(asterisk) #3is used for objects. 
vstr #0-#3
vstr For instance, if you wanted to nod to the average looking woman, you'd type #6EMOTE NODS TO #0(tilde)#6AVERAGE. You would then see: #0You nod to #5an average looking woman.#3 
vstr The rest of the room would see: #5An average looking man#0 nods to #5an average looking woman#0. #3The woman would see: #5An average looking man#0 nods to #5you#0.
vstr - 
vstr #3It works similarly for objects. If you type something like #6EMOTE GETS #0(asterisk)#6ORANGE, TOSSING IT DEFTLY INTO THE AIR AND THEN DROPPING IT#3, you would see: #0You get #2an orange#3, tossing it deftly into the air and then dropping it.
vstr - #3The room would see: #5An average looking man#0 gets #2an orange#0, tossing it deftly into the air and then dropping it.

In the Dining Area~
   This room seems to be composed of rather plain, pine walls, 
the scent of the still relatively new wood permeating the area. 
The floor, as well, is of smoothly-sanded wood and most of the 
open area in the room is taken up by a number of long tables, 
each having the capacity to hold any number of occupants. At war 
with the scent of the pine is the smell of fresh food. 

  #3To see all sittable-items in a room, use the #6TABLE #3command.
      To sit at a certain location, use #6SIT #3<#2LOCATION#3>.
 To see all public objects in a room, use the #6CONTENTS#3 command.
 Once you have food in your hand, you may #6EAT #3<#2KEYWORD#3> <#2emote#3>.
   Once you have a container, you may #6DRINK #3<#2KEYWORD#3> <#2EMOTE#3>.
 You may also #6EAT#3/#6DRINK #22 #3<#2KEYWORD#3>, to take #2two#3 bites/drinks.
      For more tricks with these commands, type #6LOOK SIGN#3.

Beneath the Bridge~
   A large bridge looms overhead, blocking all sun and moonlight 
as well as providing partial shelter from the elements. A small 
ladder like object leads back up to the bridge, built into the 
side of the bridge and gently coming to an end on the ground 
before it. The rush of the river is loud, making words spoken 
here nearly impossible to hear unless the words are spoken at a 
near-yell or louder. The water cannot be crossed, and the bank 
on this side is covered in lush, green grass.

       #3Type #6TRAVEL #3<#2string#3> to describe the way they move.
     Type #6VOICE #3<#2string#3> to set your character's usual tone.
       Type #6PMOTE #3<#2string#3> to alter your long description.

vbr -
vstr #6OMOTE#3 <#2object#3> <#2string#3> allows you to change what an object's long description looks like. This can be used to represent where an item is in a room. You can target #5people with the #0(tilde)#3 and #2objects #3with the #0(asterisk)#3 in these as well.

vbr -
vstr #6DMOTE#3 <#2string#3> allows you to temporarily add lines of text to your description. You can't alter the description itself, and this addition only lasts through the next reboot or crash.
vstr If you type #6DMOTE THERE ARE DARK CIRCLES UNDER HIS EYES#3, it will add a line to your description that says simply what you've just specified. In this case:

A GRIM, Dilapidated Cathedral~
   This cathedral, built in the gothic style, has been desecrated 
and defiled. Shadows cling to every corner and dampen what 
little light there is. The walls are soot stained and splashed 
with gore, criss-crossed with deep cracks that are fingerlike 
extentions of a single large fissure that runs down the center of 
the church. Half of the ceiling is missing, leaving what remains 
of a stained glass window to reach pleadingly into the sky. 
Large heaps of shattered pews stand like piles of kindling, 
dotted with the occasional hymnal sheets.

The stained glass windows that line the wall are dark until illuminated by a streak of lightning behind them.  They do not depict scenes of pastoral purity or of god's grace, they are scenes of torture, of hell and the gnashing of teeth.  The effigy's writhe and move and if you listen close enough you could swear they moan.

A Huge Cave In the Glacier~
   This wide cave is completely made of crystal clear, bluish 
ice. The floor is completely flat but the walls arches gently 
inwards, meeting in the middle and so creating the ceiling. The 
whole shape seems indeed unnatural almost as if the ice have been 
formed into shape by a will or conscious. Adding further to the 
unnatural impression is the blue-white light that seem to emerge 
from the walls themselves. 
   The air is cold and crisp, suckling the life out of all living 
and embracing it in an everlasting rest.

Near a Busy Bridge~
   A heavily-traversed road crosses the lands alongside a busy 
bridge here, people on foot and on horseback making up the 
largest number though some carriages pass through as well. The 
land is barren on either side, with little green grass daring to 
grow. Some trees and bushes are visible in the distance, though 
many of them look withered and dying. The roar of the river 
beneath the bridge makes conversation difficult, until more than 
a small few steps are taken away from it.

towards a wide depression. Small trails appears from a number of 
directions and lead down towards the worn and trampled bottom of 
the depression where a small camp has been erected. Tents and 
lean-to's lay packed around campfires. There is a faint smell of 
smoke and decay in the air, refuse lays scattered around the

An Expansive Valley Of Death~
   The scene of a peaceful valley comes before your eyes. A 
small, clear stream runs through the sparse shrubbery and trees. 
As you descend into the lush grasslands below the scent of death 
begins to fill the air. What looked to be grasslands at a 
distance is actually a horrific scene of humans, torn apart, the 
ground dyed red. Each person is missing their heart, a gaping 
hole in their chests. No animals can be seen or heard anywhere 
giving an eerie silence to the valley.

The Ravaged Hills Overlooking the Trenches~
   Far below, as far as the eye can see, the trenches stretch. 
Blasted, ravaged, land defiled; men are ants and scamper back and 
forth between the muddy lines as red-eyed lasers lash above their 
heads, sweeping the air and cutting swathes through what tangled, 
dead brush remains. Every once in awhile a shrill whistle marks 
the passage of a rocket overhead, followed by a reproachful bleat 
of alarm bell -- and then the solid whump whump whump before the 
burst, and bodies scatter to the breeze like leaves. The hills 
themselves are craggy and dry, the grass yellowing and dead like 
mange, leaving pocked marks here and there, craters full of 
stagnating water and pale, clammy corpses. The sky is gray, full 
of smog, and ashy clouds drift overhead, strangling the birds.

No Man's Land~
   Clouds of smoke haze this bomb-blasted, war torn field and 
broken trees hang with the singularity of old bent men. On 
either side of this empty, dead place strands of barbed wire run, 
looped over and over on themselves, and mines blink unsteadily in 
the perpetually gray dawn, little red lights plowing up dark 
earth. Bodies decorate much of the land; arms and legs caught on 
barbed wire, hands on razor wire, men twisted impossibly into 
trees and face down in craters of muck, oil-filmed and bloating. 
It is silent save for a sharp scream, or a hoarse and 
thick-throated moan, or the staccato tap-tap-tap of machine gun 
fire in the distance.

Mud Slick Trenches~
   Rows of trenches stretch backwards miles; back to where the 
reserves are still orderly and there is color left in the world. 
But here, here the forward trenches are drowning in mud and the 
screams of wounded men echo in the air, in unison with the sounds 
of gunfire, of exploding artillery, of the high-pitched whistle: 
over, over, over, over the top now -- and the frantic curses of 
panicked soldiers. Wooden planks have been laid out to try to 
stem the mud, to little affect, and men can be seen on occasion 
making vain attempts to shore up the walls. Everything is 
encroaching; men disappear like rabbits into concrete bunkers, 
hacked into either side of the trench, and smoke.

Trenches Full Of Strange-Eyed Men~
   These trenches are still in surprisingly good order; wooden 
planking shores up both sides and the bottom of the trench has 
been filled with gravel, reducing the mud to an ankle-high slush. 
At spaced intervals, openings have been hacked into the walls, 
leading down into stone bunkers stocked full of ammunition, food, 
plasteel and sleeping men; stops of stone prevent the mud from 
spilling in, but the air inside of the bunkers is stale and sour 
to taste. Men wander back and forth between the bunkers, up and 
down along the trenches, and slowly make their rounds: they are 
unusually tall, pale men with hair like shaved ice and eyes like 
chips of frost, uncanny blue and searching.

Inside A Smoky Bunker~
   This bunker is, by any standards, cramped. Equipment clutters 
much of the floor, several cots have been pushed against the 
walls, and a card table stands in the center of the room. 
Shelves and lockers stack up against the north side of the room, 
holding everything from dog tags to guns to a molding turkey 
sandwich, stuffed hastily into a rag-tongued boot. Lighting is 
provided by the single electric lamp, encased protectively in 
wire, which hangs from the ceiling; it flickers dangerously, 
casting a dim, orange-red glow.

Where Drowning Men Sleep~
   This concrete bunker is slowly filling up with mud: now to the 
ankles, in a few days it will have reached waist-deep and all the 
frantic shovelling in the world won't save it from becoming a 
premature, soggy grave. For now, though, men wander in and out, 
boots slogging through the muck, and smoking in the quiet unease 
before the Call. A table has been set up in the center of the 
otherwise bare bunker; ammunition chests are empty, lockers full 
of the paraphernalia of miscellany: letters, lockets, dog tags, 
empty shell casings, a few crushed cans of beer, or empty bottles 
of gin.

Welcome To The Thunder-Dome!!1!~
   Pale yellow light flickers from a large sign atop a large, 
cage dome, reading 'THUNDERDOME'. The cage is tall and wide, 
allowing for many participants to be within its confines, and for 
even more to grappled to the sides of the cage to spectate. The 
dirt floor of the dome is stained with blood and the shreds of 
attire. A brutal array of weaponry is at hand, and the maniacal 
onlookers cheer and jeer loudly!

Phear's Workshop~
   The walls and flooring of this icy-cold chamber are made of
a smooth, dark black stone. Embedded within the northern wall,
veins of blood-red stone can be seen. These veins seem to form
unnerving shapes as one gazing upon them. Numerous, hideously 
twisted skeletons are what meets the eye.

Outfitting Room: Odulun Salvage and Resale~
   #6Ranks:Restructured#0 The rank #6Lieutenant#0 remains the 
highest rank attainable and one in this position has full 
military authority in the organization. A Lieutenant oversees 
much of the managerial duties of the outfit and also in the 
distribution of orders to his seconds, which may be any number of 
sergeants beneath him or her. A Lieutenant may order any squad 
of any corporal, or multiple squads at once, if he wishes to and 
may even go so far as to "conscript" mercenaries into certain 
contracts (provided he also have the means to pay them) if there 
is a lack of men. #6Sergeants#0 operate directly under the 
lieutenants and serve as his long arms - they see that orders are 
given to the corporals, act out on the will of the lieutenant, 
keep the corporals and their squads in line and typically also 
assist in leading contracts in lieu of the lieutenant. A 
Sergeant may lead any number of men, from any squad of any 
corporal, for a contract and like a lieutenant may "conscript" 
mercenaries into certain contracts provided again he has the 
means with which to pay them on the spot for their trouble. 
Sergeants, however, may not lead contracts that have not been 
first approved by the lieutenant, excepting simple tasks like 
restocking forts, gathering supplies, collecting bounties or 
running escorts. #0 #6Corporals#0 answer to the sergeants and 
lieutenant of the organization, if they feel a sergeant is acting 
out of his authority, they may take this up with the lieutenant; 
if they feel the lieutenant is acting out of his authority, they 
may either confide in a sergeant and hope that their superior 
officer notifies either of the patrons of the outfit or, in lieu 
of that, may seek out one of the patrons themselves. A Corporal 
has under him three to five mercenaries, either Veteran or 
Recruit - these three or four men are completely and entirely 
under his command so far as other corporals are concerned; the 
corporal is tasked with managing these men, seeing them train 
well, and disciplining them. They may lead their squad in simple 
contracts such as the collecting of bounties, fort restocking and 
supplying, running escorts and etc. but may not attempt serious 
contracts (such as the capture of a large, fortified position) 
without permission first from a sergeant who in turn must have 
permission from the lieutenant for such a venture. Corporals may 
not lead any squad but their own unless they are given permission 
to, or those men volunteer to come on a contract, etc. #0 Each 
"#6Squad#0" will be set apart from another "Squad" by a 
sub-division, taken in the form of an animal of Ithilien. For 
instance, one corporal may lead a squad of three to five men and 
call them his "boars" - more likely, however, that squad will 
identity themselves as perhaps being "Benny's Boars" as well as 
being members of Odulun Salvage and Resale. Physical 
identification is not needed; each man will be expected to know 
his place and train, so far as is possible, with the others of 
his unit. Periodically, games will be held between the various 
Squads led by the corporals of the organization and may include 
mock combat either in pairs or by unit, games of bootskull and 
drinking games. Each corporal will be expected to inform the 
sergeants who in turn will inform the lieutenant of both the name 
of the Squad and the members of their squad. #0 Corporals will 
be tasked most heavily with recruitment; each corporal will when 
recruiting be recruiting into his own squad, unless his squad is 
already overcrowded; in that case the new Boot will be without a 
squad until he can be assigned one by a sergeant or the 
lieutenant. #0 Furthermore, #6Quartermasters#0 of the clan will 
be henceforth assumed to have no military power but function 
primarily from a managerial perspective; anything a Veteran needs 
he will report to a Corporal who will in turn seek out either a 
sergeant or, more preferrably, a Quartermaster. The Lieutenant 
and any Sergeants may also seek out the Quartermaster with lists 
of any gear or miscellany they feel they require and it is the 
Quartermaster's duty to see the outfit supplied with such; they 
are also tasked with the purchasing of food to keep the 
organization well fed, and tasked with the organization of 
various areas including but not limited to the armory, mess hall 
and the barracks proper. Quartermasters may not be conscripted 
into contracts but may themselves volunteer. Quartermasters may 
not run their own squads, nor are they a part of any squad. #0 
Though there has been none appointed yet, a #6Master of the 
Horse#0 will be tasked with the mantaining of the mounts of the 
clan, the keeping of any stables and the supply of oats, raw meat 
and etc. to keep the mounts in top shape. They are also tasked 
with the training of any new cavalry, though themselves (unless 
stated otherwise) are not corporals and may not run their own 
squads. They operate outside of squads yet may be conscripted 
into contracts and may also volunteer to help a contract along. 
If a Master of the Horse is also a corporal, their squad will be 
made up entirely of mounted cavalry. #0 A #6Boot#0 is the name 
given to a new recruit in the organization and will be assigned 
to a squad - either the squad of the corporal who recruited them 
or, if that squad was full or they were recruited by the 
lieutenant or a sergeant, a squad assigned to them to work in. 
They are expected to learn the basics of how the clan functions, 
expected to train and to follow their corporal (or another if 
they volunteer) out on several contracts. Promotion of a Boot is 
typically left up to the disgreshion of their Corporal but 
outstanding examples may be promoted by sergeants, or by the 
lieutenant himself. Boots may not choose which squad they are 
assigned to, though upon promotion may choose to attach 
themselves to a squad different to the one they joined if they so 
desire. #0 #6Veterans#0 are those mercenaries who have proven 
themselves capable of at least following most of the orders they 
are given and can fight capably; chances are they have been 
blooded in a contract or two, understand the organization of the 
outfit or (if they were contracted in from the outside) can fight 
well enough to make up for any lack of discipline they show. A 
Veteran not assigned to a squad has the freedom to pick a squad 
for himself to join, but once in a squad may not leave that squad 
without permission from a sergeant (the sergeant in turn first 
discussing this both with the Veteran's corporal and the 
lieutenant.) Veterans may elect to not go on a contract but 
constant refusal may result in a drop in pay grade, or other 
punishment by their corporal. A Veteran under no circumstance is 
required to go on contract if ordered to by a corporal not his 
own; however a sergeant or the lieutenant may order him to go on 
a contract they themselves have organized.

Extravagant Room With Smooth Stone Walls~
Though carved into the mountain, this room hardly resembles a
cave. The walls have been perfectly cut and are smooth as if
no tools were used to craft it. Filling the room are several
richly decorated pieces of furniture. Hung upon the southern
wall are great tapestries depicting a vast host marching
upon Morgoth and his innumerable evil horde, accompanying
the host of elves and men are the great Valar themselves and
at its head a large and fair being with great wings blowing
an elaborately jeweled golden trumpet. Vicious lightning
can be seen scorching the earh around the being. This room
seems to be perpetually lit as if the very stone of its
foundation resonate with a warm light.

A Meadow Atop a Long Chalk Down~
   The wind is seldom still here, murmuring quietly through a 
comb of beech trees in the near distance. The chalk of this long 
down has given rise to thick, dense turf which pads the sound of 
footfalls. A bridle path follows the margin of the beech trees 
for a distance before dipping out of sight behind the gentle 
slope of the ridge. Under close inspection it can been seen that 
the healthy grass of this area is studded here and there with 
rabbit holes.

New Room~
   Clans: Blackrend #6Organization:#0 Warchief: This is the rank 
that Huul Blackrend bears, serving as one of the chieftains 
beneath Azog directly. This is the highest rank so far as the 
warband itself is concerned and Huul Blackrend need only answer 
to Azog above him, no other. Throqu: Directly beneath Warchief 
Huul Blackrend, "Throqu" is the equivalent to a relatively 
mid-to-high ranked officer in modern military; they carry out 
Blackrend's will, direct the lower ranked snaga, and oversee 
routine life in the warband. They are not often involved in 
heavy fighting themselves, though they do have a hand in military 
planning, leaving that to the "gutters" and their crews. A 
Throqu is given nothing and there is no true sign of his rank: 
they are on merit promoted, and if they cannot hold their 
position by brute force or by guile, they lose it. The plural of 
Throqu is read as: Throq. Slaktr: The most active of the formal 
ranks in the warband, a "slaktr" is the day-to-day leader of the 
rank and file troops. They most often handle recruitment, 
low-level disciplinary issues, and most importantly lead the 
raids and attacks directly. Anyone may become a slaktr and there 
is no set method of promotion: sometimes one is picked to lead, 
and other times one might fight their way into the position. 
More often than not, it is simple attrition: a slaktr is 
relatively expendable and furthermore is expected to lead any 
attack at the front, as an example to other Orcs. Because of 
this, the turnover rate is high and it is not uncommon to have 
several promoted before, and after, a large-scale battle and 
still have positions unfilled. A slaktr may also conscript any 
member of Huul Blackrend's warband into trailing them for a 
fight, if directed to capture, kill, raid or raze by a higher 
ranked Orc, and lacking in sheer numbers to accomplish this set 
task. Organization is relatively loose, but that is not to say 
there is no heirarchy. A Throqu gives orders to a slaktr who 
then rounds up several good Orcs (most likely those he fights 
with often, his "crew") and gets the job done, or he doesn't. 
Any slaktr may challenge a Throqu for his position, and if this 
is the case then no others may interfere in the ensuing fight. 
If a loyal crew does come to the aid of a slaktr in distress, 
they will summarily be disbanded and considered weak for 
interfering. A "crew" is relatively informal, and there is no 
set stipulation that every Orc must be a part of one, but many do 
strive to become a part of a slaktr's group simply for the fame 
and glory; while there may be other perks for joining, they are 
often unimportant and subtle. This group (little more than a 
gang in truth) is composed of any number of Orcs. They may range 
from as low as two or three, or as high as five to eight members 
and function in many ways like the military squads of today. 
There is, however, no deepset loyalty to one's crew, and it is 
not uncommon to have particularly vicious (or alternatively, 
useless) snaga traded between crews. There is fierce competition 
between slaktr and their crews, each trying to kill as many tarks 
(or whatever it may be they are asked to kill that day) with as 
few of their own dead as possible. To use a sports metaphor: no 
one wants the Wooden Spoon, and crews that come in last in this 
killing competition are often ridiculed. #6General Information#0 
During the march north to Moria, Huul Blackrend and his warband 
was used extensively as crack troops and as a police force, 
keeping order within Azog's Warhost on his behalf, often in very 
public, gruesome display. In Moria, very little has changed; 
still used by Azog as readily now as then, Blackrend's boys are 
on the front line of every battle, often heavily outnumbered, and 
sent into the most unappealing and chaotic places. They have 
fought the religious fanatics of the Twisted Eye of Khagdu, have 
fought the northern tarks on the march north, and have butchered 
hundreds of rebellious orc and snaga alike who have dared to 
cross the Warleader Azog. This suits them perfectly fine; as a 
clan, under the brutal leadership of their (rumored to be) mad 
warchief, they love battle, breathe battle, and not only will not 
run from a fight but will not skirk, in the least, at the 
prospect of starting one simply for the sake of fighting. 
Individually, however, the Orcs under Huul Blackrend's leadership 
vary as much as those in Azog's Greater Warhost; throughout the 
Exodus, and after some months in Moria, Blackrend's warband had 
suffered high causalities and, at the risk of becoming a 
second-rate clan for lack of expendable soldiers, began a 
campaign of press-ganging and forcible recruitment. This has led 
to dilution in the ideals of the warband: while those original 
orcs who followed Huul Blackrend out of the east, through Mordor, 
and north to Moria are just as bloodthirsty and wild- eyed as he 
is, many of the newer blood embodies, to be fair, the more 
typical orc. That is to say, many of the new "recruits" - 
"conscripts" would be more accurate - are cautious, flighty, easy 
to intimidate and will only start a fight when they know, without 
a shadow of a doubt, that they can win it, or at least come out 
alive. Much again like Azog's Warhost, Huul Blackrend's band 
(because of the forced recruitment and kidnapping of orcs of all 
sorts from other warbands) is a conglomeration of culture and 
tradition; though there are some older traditions among the 
veterans of the clan, from the far east, there is also a healthy 
mass of traditions, culture and habits brought into the warband 
from the many tribes in Azog's Warhost; some well-known, like the 
Gothakran tradition of the Bagronk Durb and others as obscure as 
the tradition of several members of the Turolgrahk: 
self-inflicted, entirely voluntary castration. Suffice to say 
some imported traditions are practiced more widely than others, 
and some hardly at all: the more violent, cruel and wicked of 
traditions often survive and are adopted by Blackrend's warband 
as a whole, after several years. While one would think that 
morale among a warband of unwilling soldiers (though admittedly 
some are more than willing) would be low, there is an interesting 
way that Huul and his Throq have an interesting way with dealing 
with any potential deserters. During larger battles, when the 
Slaktr usually lead their groups in en masse, in waves, Throq 
take up position in the second or third waves, sometimes even a 
fourth if a particularly huge battle; this is not because they 
lack the will or desire to fight but because the Slaktr, as well 
their group of Snaga and scum, will be much less inclined to 
retreat when the swords and spears of Blackrend's Throq are 
brandished at their back. Those who do break and run are often 
hunted down and either forced back into the fight, or killed. In 
smaller scale battles this is not always the case, but a group 
that performs particularly badly will often be decimated by a 
Throqu, with every third or so snaga hacked to pieces. #6Law and 
Order#0 Slaktr usually tend to govern their own crew fairly 
independently, and punishment is typically left to their 
imaginations: too lenient and they will be seen as weak, and too 
harsh they will lose snaga to other, rival crews. Throq, on the 
other hand, have no such compunctions and are usually held in 
both terror and awe by the common Orc; they can be as ruthless as 
they please, and often are and go nearly unrivaled save for 
challenges by slaktr every once in awhile. Huul Blackrend 
himself does not typically involve himself with the day to day 
affairs of the lowly ranked, save for when he leads the warband 
in battle, and any punishments metted out by him are almost 
exclusively death. He is the only one capable of promoting, or 
demoting, a Throqu - the latter usually, again, by killing them 
outright. Typical punishments might include flogging, beating, 
the decimation of a crew that has failed to accomplish its goals 
and yet returned to the warband, loss of limbs, starvation, loss 
of arms and armor, and loss of life. #6Recent History#0 Exactly 
where Huul Blackrend and his bloody warband originiated is 
uncertain - many agree it was "further east" than Mordor, though 
just how far is still debatable. The life of Huul Blackrend is 
also subject to much speculation, as is his warband's chaotic 
rise to power. In fact, it is safe to say that most everything 
about this clan is cloaked in mystery and rumor, and few 
explanations by either Huul Blackrend or his officers are given; 
they like perpetuating the myth. Still, what is known is this: 
after Azog was tasked with taking the orcs to Moria, and after 
the call to all Orcs of Mordor went out, Huul Blackrend and his 
relatively small, but savage, warband journeyed from their home 
of origin to Minas Morgul. There, among the many hundreds of 
other tribes they were fairly insignificant and overshadowed by 
greater factions: the Ash Circle, Gothakra, and the Axes to name 
a few. Perhaps because of this, Huul Blackrend saw an 
opportunity to wage relentless and unforgiving war on any and 
every warband camped near to his, simply for the sport of it; 
this caused many small warbands (who lacked the fighting spirit 
of Huul himself) to willingly become a part of Blackrend's brutal 
tribe, rather than face battle against those psychotic and war- 
loving folk. This savagery could only go unnoticed by Azog 
himself for so long, and after several more tribes were consumed 
by Huul Blackrend's forces (now several thousand stronger in 
force, and quickly becoming a warband to reckon with) it was 
brought to the attention of the Warleader. A contingent of 
scarred orcs, and rumored Azog at their head, journeyed to the 
encampment of Huul Blackrend to demand his intentions; narrowly 
avoiding a bloody conflict, Azog managed to secure the loyalty of 
Huul Blackrend through the promise of more war, more glory, and 
more blood in the dark mines of the land Moria, which was the 
promised land - so the Witchking claimed. The actual journey 
north to the mines proved fairly uneventful for the warband; 
while used extensively as crack troops for Azog, and to police 
the other warbands, this was nothing unusual for the Orcs under 
Huul Blackrend: killing (and some might say dying) is their 
specialty. Notably, Huul Blackrend and his vicious Orcs did on 
several occasions attack and harry the forces of the Twisted Eye 
of Khagdu (who also travelled north around the same time as 
Azog.) Upon reaching Moria, Huul Blackrend and his Orcs were 
called upon again by Azog - several factions of Mountain Orcs and 
Mirkwood Orcs, as well as rebellious Mordorian Orcs under his own 
banner, were proving a problem for the Warleader. Blackrend and 
his warband were tasked, quite simply, with removing these 
threats in the most permanent manner possible: even the food 
stores of the enemy were burned (much to the Warleader Azog's 
displeasure) and the bloody, raw skins of the enemy warlords were 
stretched across shields and presented as trophies of war. Much 
else of the plunder, however, never found its way back to Azog's 
hands, and Huul Blackrend is rumored to sleep on a pile of gold 
and skulls.

The Ring at Wrestlemania XXV~
   A great arena seating many tens of thousands of fans tower 
around you. The many people gathered are chanting loudly, all in 
unison, as if one voice, 'Hulk Hulk Hulk'. You find yourself 
standing in the middle of a large blue wrestling ring. A thin 
but dampening padding makes up the mat you stand on and the sides 
of the ring are thick, elastic red and white ropes with heavily 
padded corner posts in each of the four corners. Red, white, 
blue, yellow, green and orange lights flicker above the arena and 
the rectangular ring, the noise of the crowd continuing. 
Somewhere in the distance, behind all the chanting you hear a 
song, it seems to be growing louder all the time. As the song 
goes louder the chanting dies down and suddenly #5a huge, hulking 
blond-man#0 comes wandering out from an entrance in the arena, 
the song 'Real American' playing loud and the crowd again 
exploding... prepare to be bodyslammed.

Nimrod's Recharging Station~
   A fully functional electric generating station sits in the 
corner of this room. There are a number of electrical outlets 
placed along the walls, all seeming to be at waist height. One 
notable exception is a very large outlet, located at eye-level 
along the southern wall. The floor is covered with an 
antiseptic-like white tile, which has been scrubbed clean and 
buffed to a high sheen. There is a cold metal desk set along the 
western wall, a stack of 5 1/4 inch floppies stacked neatly upon 
it.

A Large, Stone Office~
   Along the walls of the room are finely crafted wine racks. 
Instead of wine, however, the racks are filled with bottles of 
rum, whiskey, moonshine, boomshine and quite possibly water. The 
floor is stone that seems eternally cold, with only one 
exception, the ground near the massive fireplace. Across the 
center of the ground is a large bearskin rug, with its face 
pointing towards the fireplace. The fireplace itself is 
incredibly large, with a huge mantle over it. Hanging from the 
walls are various stuffed heads. A couple of Trolls, a whole lot 
of Wargs and even a few rats. Opposite the fireplace is a large, 
and utterly unfitting flatscreen TV in front of a comfortable 
recliner, though both are covered in dust. 
   Off in one cold and dark corner is a large desk, covered in 
TPS reports and parchment. In the center sits a small 
laptop,with a black background, and text endlessly flowing across 
it. A poster above it shows at first an egg. "This is your 
brain." Next is the egg cooking in a frying pan. "This is your 
brain on drugs." And, finally, is an egg cooking in a frying pan 
with a couple strips of bacon next to it. "This is your brain 
with a side order of bacon."

Karkus's Room~
   A small room, the walls covered in bookshelves tightly packed 
with old and musty tomes. The floor is of some dark, polished 
wood, and bears faint traces of chalk marks across its surface. 
All manner of strange things rest untidily on the various 
surfaces: the tooth of some vast animal, a small glass jar full 
of murky liquid with something floating inside, a tarnished, 
engraved silver dagger and an astrolabe being among the more 
recognizable artifacts. In one corner is a wooden desk and 
chair, a great map of Middle-Earth hung just over it. A small, 
glowing ball of light hovers just over the desk with no visible 
support, and provides the room's only illumination.

This room is a pleasant break from the surrounding jungle, the

hidden computer in its branches.  The ground surrounding the
tree is littered with many hotpocket wrappers and discarded

side of the door. (Peek south)

   This is obviously an older square room. Dust and a musty 
smell cling to the air here. The only evidence of anything being

A small digital keypad sits on the wall next to the door. A

Balcony Protruding From A Colossal Mountain~
Protruding from this absolutely colossal mountain, covered in
glittering white snow, is a small balcony with a parapet. The
view is astounding from this height, far over the great sea
can be viewed with the naked eye. The silver waves shimmer
in the light and crash in harmonious music against several
lush emerald isles. Sea birds can be seen flying in groups
over the sea, and great eagles occasionally swoop down to
perch on the ledge of the parapet here.

A Small Garden~
   Though appearing to be no more than a dozen paces in diameter, 
this circular garden is more than capable of holding really 
anything. A disproportionate amount things fits in its 
boundaries. The surrounding support columns appear to be made of 
an ivory material. Each one is crafted of dozens of bone pieces, 
individually inscribed with extremely intricate designs. 
   The earth has been finely worked, with massive blossoms 
growing in straight lines. Extremely fragrant, they offer a 
relief to the somewhat morbid necrosis being shown on the 
pillars. In the center of the garden is a single, white marble 
arch. Inscribed along its top is the simple name, readable in 
any language, "Bones".

A Dessert Island~
   Desserts surround you, tantalising you from every direction: 
to the west a large patch of banoffee pies scream out, "EAT ME!" 
As you traverse this sticky terrain to the north you suddenly see 
an outcrop of chocolate sundaes rising up, shooting jelly 
sprinkles into the air. As you pass the outcrop and near what 
looks like the water's edge, you realise it is in fact melted 
light blue icing, from which milk chocolate fish jump merrily.

rocky pathways on either side of the slow-flowing water. Moss

study. Sunlight filters through shear white curtains, and the 
view through the window of a flowing river, aqua in the sunlight 
past a graceful willow tree, attracts the eye. Bookshelves 
holding rows of old leatherbound books and rolled scrolls stand 
to either side of a pair of French doors. The doors are of 
cherry, with panes of clear glass, inviting one into a garden 
patio to the east. The floor is of red oak, laid in a 
herringbone parquet. Two comfortable reading chairs of Danish 
design with a marble torchier lamp between them face the western

An Old Forest of Lichen-Covered Trees~
   The forest floor is clear here, save for the occasional fallen 
limb or loose stone, a deep bed of dry needles and withered 
leaves whispering steadily underfoot at any rumor of passage. 
Though their movements are furtive, the flitting progress of 
nuthatches or occasional twitches of squirrels tails are easy to 
spy among the uncluttered trunks of the wood. Strong, old roots 
crawl like fat snakes over the earth while the colossal branches 
give a smothering shadow to everything below, allowing only 
dappled light to break through their leaves and limbs.

Within A Peaceful Meadow~
   Several trees line the edge of this meadow, with light 
filtering down between the branches and leaves, giving ample 
shade. A gathering of small, blackened stones have been placed 
within the center of this meadow. A simple hammock has been 
strung between two sturdy oak trees, which sways gently in the 
cool breeze.

Inside of a Tree Hut~
   Simple in design is this tree hut. Four walls enclose this 
area, shielding those inside from the harsh and unpredictable 
world beyond. There is a ladder in the center of the floor, 
leading down into the forest below. This area is peaceful and 
set in tranquility, a perfect place to meditate and connect with 
nature and other powers far beyond the human mind.

The Meadow~
   A pleasant meadow spreads through the clearing here, wild and 
untamed. Knee high grass rises from the ground, interspersed 
with clumps of brightly colored wildflowers. Nearby to the north 
a small stream winds its way through the meadow, a small 
multicolored tent erected beside it. Beyond in the distance, 
almost hidden in haze, rises a range of mountains. The meadow 
continues to the east, north, and south, though it is not far 
until the clearing once again is reclaimed by the forest that 
surounds it.

a small stream winds its way through the meadow, a small

A Boggy, Muck-Heaped Swamp~
An eeiry glow emanates about this swamp, odd bits of decrepit
ruins overgrown with moss, reeds, and muck. Odd glows and gases
escape in hisses every so often, and it seems like the light of
the sun avoids this place always. It seems as if there is no
path where one could keep their boots dry, pitfalls into deep
muddy pits rampant. You even see DEAD PEOPLE when you look
into some stagnant ponds! Don't fall in!

The Flowering Pot in a Little Potting Shed~
   You are standing inside the little potting shed. The shed has 
been transformed into a luxurious garden. Trees surround the 
room while flower beds have been carefully nurtured, transforming 
them into furniture, strong but soft and comforting. As you walk 
farther in, you realize the carpet is a thick, lustrous grass 
that is very comfortable to walk on walk on barefooted. In the 
middle of the room is a marble and granite fountain of a dragon 
that stands to full height with its wings towards its back, water 
flows from its mouth, cascading into the pool at its base. The 
dragon's arms and hands are open, as if waiting for something, or 
inviting you into its embrace. Upon the ceiling, you see the 
sky, beautifully painted. It begins by the door where the sun 
shines brightly. As the room continues, the sky becomes darker, 
so that it ends with the moon and stars, which have all been 
delicately sketched in.

The Interior of an Imposing Marble Edifice~
   The walls of this spacious room are constructed entirely out 
of cold, white marble, a structure made from monolithic blocks in 
ages past. The blocky walls rise up to a roof, high above, 
supported by six pillars; at the end of the hall farthest from 
the massive double doors sits a high dias, the steps leading up 
to it framed in obsidian; atop this sits an imposing, almost 
altar-like, desk, clearly designed to be the focus of attention 
for the remnants of this once-magnificent hall, as quiet as it 
now is. Despite the darkness, two torches are set into each of 
the side walls, centered between the pillars, providing an 
illumination barely sufficient to allow human eyes to see.

Within a Dank, Dark Dragon Cave~
   The dank smell of stale air surrounds this cave. There are 
pieces of half rotten meat and torn rags all about the entryway, 
though deeper into the cave there is a massive pile of gold and 
gems. Armour and weapons glitter in the darkness, though the 
finest gem in the cave is a massive diamond on a small pedestal. 
If someone was to look out the front of the cave, they would see 
scantily clad damsels, all chained onto stakes in the ground.

Inside a Dragons Stomach~
   All about the area there is a vile stench of death and decay. 
Dimly lit, the walls appear to be moving slowly in an in and out 
motion and are pinkish in colour. A small island of safety is in 
the middle, above a large hole, with the rest of the area coated 
in a burning and acidic liquid, melting most of what it touches. 
All about the sides are skeletons, trying desperately to claw 
their way out of the liquid, their armour still on their bodies. 
Every so often, some of the food is flushed down another hole But 
you don't want to go there.

An enormous room of marble~
   This cavernous room is quite cool, especially compared to the 
one on the other side of the large marble door. The same black 
and grey material comprises the floor and the walls of the place. 
Though the dimensions are quite large on their own, equatable to 
a small warehouse, it is the ceiling that creates the feeling of 
enormity. The walls stretch upward for over two stories before 
disappearing into a misty, hazy blackness, the depths and 
contents of which are uncertain. The room is lit with a strange, 
thin, silvery light, its source unknown.

Niphredil test: An Active Construction Project~
   This area is filled with tools and busy workmen. The ground 
about the framework of a small building has been cleared 
completely, and there are men working industriusly at all hours. 
   
   #3This room will exist for one RL month. The intent is to 
avoid having anything appear too quickly, but that batts clan 
will know something is happening. Hence the voices of the 
construction laborers being heard in the trail room to the east.

Niphredil test: Hall of Memories~
   Sounds are muted here. Soft upholstered benches line the 
walls, and tapestries keep sounds from traveling very far, 
allowing conversation without disturbing others. A series of 
podiums, with books atop them, traverse the room, with light from 
lamps above shining down on them at all hours. 
   
   #3The purpose of using boards is to allow illiterate batts 
members access to their history. So the sage object in this room 
"reads" to them from the yearbooks.. 
   
   
   The tiny rprog prevents the "write" command from being used in 
this room, making these unclanned boards read/only. Copies may 
be loaded into a sage-only room, such as in the MT library, to 
allow clanned PCs to amend or update them easily. 
   
   My intent is to go back through all of batts history, if 
records can be found. The clan message board only goes back to 
message numbers in the 6000s...about one IG year or so. (1-5999 
have been redacted. I'll PM Kite about them if this project is 
approved.) 
   
   One cannot address boards by number when reading. "Read 2490 
1" fails. I can either have each board with different cover art, 
or, use "sr2490" and "sr2489", or both. For this example, I am 
using cover art to differentiate for readers. Either way, an OOC 
Sign rprog will be needed.#0

Niphredil test: A Stone Dock~
   Standing on the small ferry dock, the sense of the looming 
mass of Cair Andros bears down on arrivals. The dock is made of 
heavy stone blocks some are new and squared and clean, while 
heavy stone blocks some are new and squared and clean, while 
others seem ancient, their corners rounded or crumbling or even 
broken away. The cliff face above is not sheer, but ragged and 
covered with boulders and jagged outcrops. Signs of bombardment 
are eveywhere, great chunks of the stone broken and fallen to
form precarious piles perched on narrow ledges below. Here and 
there some form of plant life has managed to find a purchase. A 
narrow starcase winds its torturous way upward toward a few 
whitewashed stone buildings improbably clinging to the cliff face 
above. 
   A steep ramp has been carved out of the cliff face next to the 
steps so wagons and carts and horses can reach the fortress. 
Bridges stretch off east and west across the wide bend of the
Anduin here as it begins to surge back southwards into a single 
river. 
   A path leads into the woods of Cair Andros to the north.
 
 
#3The only change is the very last line... indicating the new path north.

The Pit~
   This dark, dank pit gives off eery feelings of danger and 
death. Crowded with creatures of various shapes and sizes, one 
can't help but feel immediately overwhelmed and threatened in 
their presence. The sounds of howls, growls, and screams echo 
off the dull stone walls that look up at a barred steel grate 
high up in the ceiling. Occasionally, a solemn, yet commanding 
voice echos down from the grate, causing one of the creatures to 
suddenly vanish. Anyone that is not in control of these 
creatures would find themselves very unlucky to be here, praying 
only for a fast death, which just might come.

cause the glittering stars overhead to play peekaboo, winking and 
twinkling and shedding enough light that after some acclimation, 
it is difficult to imagine these woods ever being truly dark.

   Mighty sentinels rise all around, their hoary thick trunks 
home to thick moss growth, pancake-like mushrooms and countless 
hidden creatures whose soft rustles and insectoid chitters 
disclose their inhabitation. The ground is hidden by the thick 
fingers of fog which tendril and creep caressingly up the trees.

canopy of silver-green leaves gather the rain, spilling it in 
uneven cascades from above.

   Mighty sentinels rise all around, their dark shadows black

again. The rain-soaked ground is a soggy carpet of fallen

Snow gathers atop the branches, turning all that was once green

criss-cross the encrusted glittering kiss of winter upon the 
ground, further evidence of the unseen dwellers of this quiet 
wood. As the snow falls from above, all the world seems quiet as 
if the blanket covering the ground has also stilled sound.

Eagle's Cave~
   This large cave is open and roomy, with a high curved ceiling. 
Though a natural cave, it is obvious that some parts of it have 
been cut into the rock of the walls and floors. At the base of 
the west wall a pool has been formed. The pool is fed by a 
natural spring which flows into one end of it from the cave wall 
and out again at the other end. One end of the pool is slightly 
deeper making it perfect for bathing or swimming. There is a 
recess cut into the floor alongside of the pool. With the stone 
being cooled by the water of the pool, it is filled with food and 
drinks. The middle of the room is open with a smooth floor, 
leaving plenty of room for furniture or dancing, depending on the 
occasion. In the northwest corner a fireplace has been carved 
into the wall, a natural chimney allowing the smoke to escape. 
Partitions block off a work area on the eastern side of the room. 
The south wall is almost non-existent as a huge archway opens to 
the outdoors, allowing air, light and a view of the valley, far 
below this high mountain cliff. There is a natural overhang 
sticking out that partially hides the opening and keeps all but 
the fiercest winds out.

A Snowy Riverbed~
   This tranquil riverbed trails along, originating from the 
White Mountains at the base of the snow-clad Starkhorn mountain 
and traveling along past the city of Edoras to meet the river 
Entwash among the grassy plains of Rohan. It is home to the 
river Snowbourn, who rests her ice-cold waters upon the grey and 
blue hues of the smooth river-rocks that form her bed. Seas of 
grass caress the rivers edge, fertile and lush and abundant.

Taurgalas' Testing Field~
   This is a flowing sea of grasses bordering the edge of an 
ancient forest. Peaceful and mostly quiet, the grass sometimes 
moves thanks to some small earthen dweller or perhaps merely just 
the wind. Brown and green with the scent of vegetation fresh on 
the air, it seems a pleasant place to while away an afternoon or 
lie out stargazing at night.

forest~
set var 1desc1 The air stands thick and heavy through the forest, even at mid-day tendrils of mist wrap themselves around the trunks of the tall trees.
set var 1desc2 Green light barely pierces through the trees here, leaving much of the lower forest in darkness. 
set var 1desc3 Barely any light manages to get through the thick canopy of the forest. 
set var 1desc4 The hammering staccato of foraging woodpeckers often disturbs this otherwise quiet stretch of forest. 
set var 1desc5 The decaying scent of decomposing leaves pervades the area, tinged with a more fetid odor. 
set var 1desc6 Cast in a perpetual twilight due to the limbs of the trees, this area has taken on an eerie quality.
set var 1desc7 The sounds of birds seems to overwhelm all other sounds in the area, harsh calls and replies emerging from all around.
set var 1desc8 An eerie quality has taken over this forest. Sounds seem almost muted in the thick and muggy air.
set var 1desc9 Only the occasional rustling of brush breaks the silence that has taken over this area.
set var 1desc10 A dim greyness dominates this forest, the light muted.
set var 1desc11 Green light filters through the branches of the thick forest, giving one's sight a misty quality.
set var 1desc12 The air here is humid and thick, tendrils of mist rolling through the forest.
set var 1desc13 The stink of rot pervades the area, though its source is impossible to discern.
set var 1desc14 The pleasant chirp of birds sounds from the branches overhead during the daylight, echoing through the forest.
set var 1desc15 Up above, the sky can clearly be spied through the ceiling of the woodland, webbed with limbs and branches.
set var 1desc16 Only the occasional crack of a branch snapping underfoot breaks the silence of the forest.
set var 1desc17 Light seems to filter down to the forest floor lazily here, the air still.
set var 1desc18 This section of forest broods in silence, the only sound the rustle of leaves against each other in the canopy above.
set var 1desc19 The forest seems to be alive with the activity of its innumerable denizens, their chirps, squawks, and growls echoing through the trees.
set var 1desc20 A heavy fog seems to rise from the forest floor here, thick tendrils wrapping around the trunks of the trees.
set var 1desc21 All is quiet in the forest, no birds or animals seeming to venture out from their hiding places.
set var 1desc22 The canopy here has thinned somewhat, shafts of light breaking through and brightening the area.
set var 1desc23 A subtle silence mutes the region, eerily devoid of the usual noises from woodland fauna.
set var 1desc24 The air hangs heavily here; a silence weighing from the branches and dampening the region. Every crack and rustle of a footstep echoes unnaturally loudly in the quiet.
set var 1desc25 Dark and foreboding, the forest here seems to almost watch the passage of the living.
set var 2desc1 Ferns, brambles, and small bushes are sparsely scattered across the loam.
set var 2desc2 Bushes and brambles jostle for space between the trunks.
set var 2desc3 Clusters of wildflowers dot the underbrush here in warmer seasons, but lie withered and pale in the years colder months.
set var 2desc4 Moss and other lichen grow at the base of the trees here, whilst upward along their trunks sits the bumpy trail of brown-capped mushrooms.
set var 2desc5 An assortment of vegetation, from clover to fern, thickly populates the woodland ground, hugging the trunks of trees and climbing its way across the uneven earth.
set var 2desc6 Thick brambles have overtaken the area, making progress difficult, but not impossible.
set var 2desc7 Although some vegetation may hide in crevices and hollows, most of the region seems free of much of the usual underbrush.
set var 2desc8 Thick wild grasses rise from the soil, brushing against the trunks of the trees and hiding any other vegetation or wildlife from view.
set var 2desc9 Dark twining briars rise from the ground, their tangled canes tipped with dangerous jagged points to deter anyone from approaching too closely.
set var 2desc10 A thick growth of vines tangle snakelike to coat cling against the eastern sides of the trees and affix their sucking roots into the ground.
set var 2desc11 Grass grows throughout, save directly beneath the trees where the leaves and needles smother it out.
set var 2desc12 Tiny pale petals are whisked by the wind and carried over the grass, churned into small circles in the air.
set var 2desc13 Deep within the shade, ferny plants of all sizes come to thrive.
set var 2desc14 Stalked ferns half-buried in ancient leaves, keep watch over thick patches of moss and miniature forests of mushrooms in their season.
set var 2desc15 Ivy runs rampant in the dim woods below, engulfing many of the straggling saplings and leaving in its wake strange, leafy-green hillocks and berms of foliage.
set var 2desc16 Patches of bright-flowered goldenrod bloom here in warmer seasons, thriving in the open fieldland. Woody bushes of boxthorn, scraggy and bleak in the winter and laden with plump red berries in spring, pepper the encircling trees.
set var 2desc17 Low, fleshy, broad-leafed plants explode near the ground with brilliant, foam-white flowers.
set var 2desc18 Ivy hangs in curtains from above, making it hard to see what lays ahead for a certainty, as much of it had come to form one tangled mesh over time, mirroring the trees that they dangle from.
set var 2desc19 Ferns begin to overtake the other plantlife. Ranging from bright green to more dark and mellow shades, the smaller they are the more pure the hues that they possess.
set var 2desc20 Small bushes and tall grasses cover the forest floor, hiding the occasional fallen debris that seek to trip the unwary.
set var 2desc21 Miniscule, yellow-white flowers bud and glisten profusely from the vines that laps greedily at the plants, while curling fern limbs coil out from underneath, reaching into the air in some desperate hope of escape from that which hold it.
set var 2desc22 There is scant grass growing in between the trees, the spaces mostly claimed by the plants and their jailors; the thick vines winding and attaching to the ferns and other flora, permitting little space to move.
set var 2desc23 A wide assortment of weedy grasses grows in patches underfoot, sprinkling the forest floor with swathes of yellow-green colour.
set var 2desc24 Coriaceous nets of deep-green ivy have been cast about the forest flora, clinging fast to the trunks of trees and swarming about other vegetation. A smattering of glossy-leaved wildflowers lend the woodland here colour in the warmer months, but lie withered and dead in winter.
set var 2desc25 Thick, twiggy brambles and nettles flank the trunks of nearby trees, lying in wait to snag the feet of unwary passers-by. Webs of leathery ivy with deep green, spiny leaves spill over the boughs of the wooded flora here.
set var 3desc1 Great fungi shaped like half-discs grow out from the side of fallen, decaying logs. 
set var 3desc2 An occasional rock pushes up from the floor of the forest, starkly gray. 
set var 3desc3 Several full grown trees have fallen over, and their rotting remains reveal a soft wood and parchment-like bark that peels off in sheets. 
set var 3desc4 A single boulder rests on its side, covered in lichen and moss and seeming somehow out of place amongst the trees. 
set var 3desc5 Intermittently, a fallen tree trunk or bough obstructs one's movement here, overrun by pale moss and fungus. 
set var 3desc6 Nearly hidden after years of neglect and decay, what might have once been a large cabin of some sort has fallen in on itself near the western edge of the area.
set var 3desc7 Branches gnarled and twisted with age, a wizened culumalda tree stands a silent vigil here.
set var 3desc8 Beneath the layer of detritus and loam, what appear at first to be random stones strewn about reveal themselves to be the remains of some long-forgotten footpath.
set var 3desc9 The last remains of a red-brick chimney manage to pierce the underbrush near a stand of forlorn apple trees.
set var 3desc10 Behind a twining coupled pair of saplings that rise from the same root, the stacked stone corner of what must have once been part of an ancient wall looms.
set var 3desc11 Mice and other small creatures thrive in the carpet of growth, creating crisscrossing trails beneath the sheltering leaves. 
set var 3desc12 Cobwebs oscillate the reflection of light from their moist strings, spanning from trunk to trunk in silvery-grey weave, little droplets of moisture clinging to their weave.
set var 3desc13 A small section of trail progresses past a massive elm, leading to tiny patch of clear ground within a belt of beeches, whereupon the ancient dirt pathway falters and disappears entirely.
set var 3desc14 There is little sign of life aside from the standing guardians of the forest and the other plantlife.
set var 3desc15 Mud puddles lurk in more than one place, spurting out bubbles from time to time.
set var 3desc16 Black-capped mushrooms grow in dense clusters about the bases of the surrounding trees, and in great numbers on the withered faces of fallen tree-boughs nearby.
set var 3desc17 The rare dead or dying tree can be spied amongst the old, but vibrant forest life here, their leafless and skeletal frames plainly perceptible.
set var 3desc18 Shelves of dull, orange-grey fungus, speckled with grime, deck some of the older trees in this section of the forest.  
set var 3desc19 The occasional rocky crag emerges through the earthen woodland floor, grey limestone faces freckled with blood red lichen.
set var 3desc20 Sickly grey fungus stipples the surfaces of fallen trees here, spreading over the dying wood like a death shroud.
set var 3desc21 Cobwebs enmesh much of the growth and drift lazily above from the boughs of the trees when caught in a rare breeze.
set var 3desc22 The rare dead or dying tree can be spied amongst the old, but vibrant forest life here, their leafless and skeletal frames plainly perceptible.
set var 3desc23 Deadfall is plentiful here, dislodged rocks of all sizes collecting uphill of the fallen tree remnants.
set var 3desc24 Nearly completely hidden beneath the growth of the woods, a section of blackened stones dots a line; the last vestige of some long-destroyed foundation.
set var 3desc25 Enmeshed in flora, camouflaged from immediate discernment, an ancient and rusted anvil is half-buried in the ground at an angle like that of a sinking ship.
set var 4desc1 Black soil lies underfoot; fertile, but firm, and held tight by the roots of the rising trunks. 
set var 4desc2 Ridges of murky grey limestone rise and fall here, adding a wild, unpredictable depth to the forest landscape. 
set var 4desc3 At the foot of the trees and up their trunks grows a dark green spear-leafed ivy that carpets the ground here. 
set var 4desc4 Narrow, unearthed roots enmesh the earth below in a sinuous tapestry, most overrun by the substantial undergrowth of the encompassing wood. 
set var 4desc5 A loose carpet of debris has gathered here, supple twigs and curled fallen leaves padding ones step. 
set var 4desc6 The ground rises and falls here in gentle undulations, adding depth to the forest floor, and resulting in occasional ridges or tree-spotted hills.
set var 4desc7 The floor of the wood here is often blanketed by a carpet of loose leaves, twigs and bark, all in various stages of decomposition.
set var 4desc8 The hard earth of the ground underfoot is densely packed, anchored fast by the feet of the encircling trees. 
set var 4desc9 The forest floor is clear here, save for the occasional fallen limb or loose stone, a deep bed of dry needles and withered leaves whispering steadily underfoot at any rumor of passage.
set var 4desc10 A ridgeline, perhaps the last diminished remnant of some grander hill, makes passage here difficult for all but the most sure-footed.
set var 4desc11 A fold in the floor of the wood creates a sheltered dell, screened by tress but more open within.
set var 4desc12 Broken off tree limbs, weathered from age lay upon the ground, hindering travel and cracking when stepped upon.
set var 4desc13 Fallen leaves are scattered everywhere, some already decaying and giving off a scent of musk as it mingles with the damp soil.
set var 4desc14 Leaves are strewn heavily. Most of them are rotting and decaying into the soil, though the top layer would appear to be mostly fresh. It emits a soft, pungent odour, that of the forest.
set var 4desc15 The forest floor here is littered with fallen needles and other dry foliage, which soften one's step; save for the occasional twig lying in wait beneath the carpet.
set var 4desc16 Dried leaves and scraggly weeds dot along the path, the dirt soft underfoot and ever damp.
set var 4desc17 Thick drifts of discarded pine needles and rotted leaves fill the area beneath the stands of trees.
set var 4desc18 Undulations of earth give way to hints of turf and loam, suggesting a break in the woods somewhere not too distant.
set var 4desc19 The ground is soft underfoot, somehow it seems easier to sink into the dirt and soil than in other sections of the woods.
set var 4desc20 A sharp downhill slope distinguishes this section of wood, the steepness of such an angle as to pose a significant danger for the unwary.
set var 4desc21 The landscape here undulates severely at times, rising swiftly into rocky hillocks before plunging down into deep gullies.
set var 4desc22 The wide roots of the ancient trees that protrude above the forest floor here are slick with mold and crawling with moss.
set var 4desc23 Thick, grimy roots creep outward in webs from the bases of surrounding trees, burrowing in and out of the black earth.
set var 4desc24 The earth underfoot is dank and dark but covered in a loose blanket of debris, from dry yellow needles, to shrivelled strips of rotten bark.
set var 4desc25 Thick blankets of dark green moss swathe the broad trunks of Ithilien's strong evergreens, and pad the ground underfoot in heavy patches.
set var 5desc1 The broad trunks of the surrounding wood give way here to a small stand of lesser trees; cherry, hawthorn, and wild mulberry among them.
set var 5desc2 The sovereign rulers here are elder trees, their strong, old roots crawling like fat snakes over the earth.
set var 5desc3 Ancient trees around stretch tall and regal, with the lowest branches being almost ten feet off of the ground, interspersed with far smaller saplings and offshoots. 
set var 5desc4 Several trees cloaked in white flaky bark grow from the ground in long straight lines before blossoming into leaf-bearing branches.
set var 5desc5 A series of trees, their stately silhouettes reaching to the sky, grow here amidst other newer growth.
set var 5desc6 Oval leaves, slender beams, white bark and far reaching surface roots render a ephemeral majesty to these grand trees.
set var 5desc7 The trees here have many crooked branches, their lines changing direction abruptly in their effort to hold forth their foliage to the sky above.
set var 5desc8 Sporting bifurcated blue-green foliage the branches of the trees in this area are supported by slender trunks.
set var 5desc9 The lofty magnificence of the trees here are marked by thick trunks of shedding bark from which spring long slender branches which support needle-like leaves.
set var 5desc10 Here grow trees sporting contrasting peeling bark and smooth trunks with intricate intertwining branches, the foliage of which mingle in a variety of leaves and needles.
set var 5desc11 Graceful sweeping branches support fragrant evergreen needles of the towering conical trees that dominate this area.
set var 5desc12 The craggy trunks of the close growing trees found here support heavy branches with limited foliage.
set var 5desc13 Mighty trees are defined by strong branches, glossy deep red-gold arrow-headed leaves and mammoth height punctuating this region.
set var 5desc14 Peeling bark encases each of the many birches here, ranging from snow white to pale grey in hue.
set var 5desc15 The birches that preponderate here are lithe and willowy in form, their narrow branches and wider trunks seeming quite pliant.
set var 5desc16 Numerous trees, mostly silvery rowans, rise up high overhead, their slender roots, occasionally unearthed, crisscrossing below.
set var 5desc17 Dejected conifers grow through this portion of the wood and a few bedraggled and drooping pines seem too sorrowful to lift their heavy branches.
set var 5desc18 Below a stately procession of pine, elm, and ash, few saplings dare stand to rival their elders.
set var 5desc19 The trees here grow in close vicinity, gnarled boughs converging above, their knurled, sooty trunks weeping deep amber sap.
set var 5desc20 Firs and pines rise in dense thickets throughout the woodland, tall trunks ribbed and knotted, and sheathed in stony bark.
set var 5desc21 Lofty pines, bulky spruces and colossal firs grow side by side in close proximity throughout the surrounding woodland.
set var 5desc22 A stand of silvery-barked rowans rises proudly in a small clearing. Their smaller figures prominent amongst the greater giants of oak, pine and birch surrounding them.
set var 5desc23 Gnarled and twisted giants of trees, knobby and scarred like arthritic anscestors, tower over the younger growth of the woods.
set var 5desc24 Spruces are especially common here, their long trunks wrapped in bushy, conic cloaks of blue-green needles, their lowest boughs drooping downward at man-height.
set var 5desc25 Towering firs loom over the landscape, the forest ground peppered with dry cones that have fallen from their gnarled limbs.

A Narrow Horse Stall~
   For some reason, this narrow horse stall has been littered 
with coconuts and coconut shells. Some even tied with strings to 
make bikinis. Oh my. Anyway, hay lines the floor and the place 
smells strangely like, you guessed it, coconuts, instead of the 
usual horse mustiness. But there is hay. Because horses live 
here. Or at least one horse.

Waiting Room~
   This small yet comfortable waiting room is made of whitewashed 
masonry walls. There are no windows or doors out. This room is 
mostly silent and calm, allowing time to rest and reflect while 
waiting for whatever reason you were put here for.

Vaire's Minas Tirith and Progging Command Center~
A grand, vaulted ceiling covers the area, great scenes of battle
and other major historical events throughout the history of middle
earth encased within the dome, painted with masterful precision
and with an unearthly quality seeming to bring the scenes almost
to life as they are viewed. The stone dome quickly gives way to
the walls which support it, comprised of white marble which is
decorated fully with wall sconces, tapestries and within a smaller
portion of the northern wall is set a futuristic computer terminal,
a multi-head display reading out various information in strange and
exotic sigils. A small pedastel sits beside the terminal, displaying
a small, holographic representation of a cute, cheery butler. His
name is Jeeves.
