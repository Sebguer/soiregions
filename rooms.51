However, I'd like to sort of push this use into the Great Hall, 
where folks do everything, So I'm sure what else this room would 
be used for. 

Room has the Staircase up

   This could be the kitchen. However, I sort of like the idea 
of a kitchen split off into its own section, as is historically 
the case due to the fear of Fire.

   The Entry Hallway. A small contingent (2-4?) of soldier's 
will likely stand here. Thus, it may be advisible to partition 
off the eastern and western exits so there's more of a funnel. 
I'm also pondering murder holes from above.

   I'm pondering this as possibly an infirmary section, however, 
its abit close to the entry for that, so I'm not positive. Nor 
am I sure that its not better to just use the barracks for folks 
as an infirmary isn't exactly accurate to history as far as I'm 
aware. I do want somewhere to put Garrick, the Club footed 
drunken medic though, provided the rprogs to get him to be 
available only some of the time, that Rhino was working on, can 
be worked out.

their skills. Thick rope marks the boundaries on all sides of 
the ring but a short gap to the south where the rope have been 
tied into posts a few feet from one another, allows for entry and 
egress.

know what will happen if you fall into a room that leads to an

Before the Bastion~
   Perched atop the cliffs of the Emmyn Arnen, an imposing 
bastion of grey stone rises up here. A well tended path cuts 
through the normally rocky ground, leading to the iron-banded 
doors before turning sharply towards the east and following 
around the base of the wall towards what appears to be an 
attached stable. High above the moon emblazoned door, a stout 
beam bears a pair of sconces, set to illuminate the path even 
during the dark of night.

Traveling Around the Bastion~
   The tended trail comes to a halt right before the strong, 
wooden doors of a large barn, built up against a stone bastion. 
A fence of chopped logs borders the eastern and southern sides, 
above a steep but short drop. Above the barn door, a beam 
stretches out from an archers box, bearing two lanterns that cast 
light over the path even during the night.

Bastion Stables~
   The smell of hay and manure hangs heavy in this place. 
Constructed from solid wood, this stablehouse is attached to the 
side of a white-stone bastion, the wall and reinforced door 
leading into it visible to the east. Hay is scattered thick on 
the ground, while some dozen segments of wood partition off much 
of the space into stalls. To the south, a set of double doors 
wide enough to allow the passage of two horses abreast allows 
egress, while a rickety ladder nailed into the wall allows access 
to the loft.

Bastion Common Room~
   The walls are made of a native stone, with a stout oak door 
set in the south wall. A small stone hearth has been set at the 
western wall, radiating warmth throughout the colder months of 
the years, a small pile of firewood set beside it ready to be fed 
to the flames. A stone stairwell leads upward to the second 
floor of the bastion. A cosy, comfortable atmosphere hangs over 
the common room that takes up most of the ground floor of the 
bastion.

Kitchen~

Pots, pans and cooking utensils hang from the huge ceiling beams 
by the large, stone hearth. Scrubbed to a soft shine, the planks 
of the wooden floor reflect the light from the iron sconces 
dotting the stone walls. A curtained portal leads to the south 
and a trap door is set in the floor.

Cellar~
   Sturdy wooden stairs lead down into this cool earthen cellar. 
Walls of hard packed earth are carefully smoothed and white- 
washed. A series of wood shelving lines one wall from the rough 
wooden ceiling to the uneven stone floor. Bins and crates are 
strewn about while cabinets sit along the far wall. A single 
lantern hangs from a ceiling beam throwing uneven light across 
the cool, dank room.

Sleeping Chambers~
   Comfortable and spacious, this area is designed for relaxation 
and quiet conversation. The white, native stone that makes up 
the walls lacks proper windows. Instead, the light from the 
sconces is supplemented by what little comes in through a series 
of small arrow slits. A rail-less staircase of simple wood hugs 
the round walls, spiraling up towards the rooftop. Sturdy wooden 
doors are set in the north and east walls, allowing access to a 
portioned area.

   Partitioned off by a sturdy door in the southern wall, this 
chamber appears to serve as the Holdfasts armoury, its space 
covered in racks, shelves and crates. The floor and roof are 
made of the same wooden timbers as the rest of the Bastion, 
although the outer white stone wall forms only one of the walls.

Watch Tower~
   The crenelated top of the white-stone bastion provides a truly 
splendid view of the surrounding countryside. Northwards, below 
the cliffs of the Emmyn Arnen, the North Ithilien stretches out 
into the horizon, boggy marshlands just barely visible on the far 
horizon, while closer, the Morgulduin river cuts across the land 
before it melds with the Anduin and the ruined city of Osgiliath. 
Southwards, the Emyn Arnen and its rocky bluffs loom, while just 
to the west a narrow defile crosses the divide between the two. 
The bastion has been made of white limestone, and this crenelated 
top is lit at night by four iron brackets driven into the floor.

lined with granite blocks to form a cold, uninviting cellar. 
Although large enough to store a sizable quantity of material, 
the iron shackles bolted into the walls suggest that its 
intention was not to store goods. The hard floor is covered in 
musty hay that provides at least some small degree of comfort. A 
barred trap-door opens up into the stables above, a narrow stone 
staircase trailing down into the cell from it.

   This landing has been built solidly into the planks of the 
stables, although seems an afterthought more than a planned 
storage space. Though piles of hay and other equipment cover the 
wooden flooring, the true purpose appears to be the slight 
overhang and narrow window along the south wall, an overhang that 
gives a clear and semi-protected view of the stable's entrance.

apparently what is used as a store-room of sorts for the masons 
and carpenters hard at work at this camp. Closer to the wall, a 
short wooden staircase leads up to the top of the crude timber 
wall, while in all other directions from the wall, the camp and 
its mass of workers and warriors stretches out.

to show as one moves closer to the wall itself. The camp is 
marked by the smell of sweat, sawdust and greasy cookfires, while 
the sound of striking hammers, cutting saws and ringing practice 
blades chorus with the ever present dull murmer of the many men 
who inhabit this camp.

materials. Tucked away within the joint of the walls is a narrow 
staircase leading upwards onto the walls.

Traveling up the ramp to the keeps foundation~
   The center of the camp, and seemingly the focus for the busy 
ongoings, this spot is rarely quiet whatever the time of day. A 
sizable earthen ramp has been scraped together, leading up to the 
man-height stone foundation upon which a great deal of the 
construction is focused. From what must have been the source of 
the ramp's material, a wide firepit has been dug. All around are 
carpenters, masons, laborers of all sorts, and noticeably, men 
bearing arms.

By The Gate~
   While the remainder of the wall surrounding this military camp 
is questionably built from dirt and timber, the east gate here 
seems to have had particular attention paid to its construction. 
Though still of wood, its posts have been solidly driven and its 
wooden doors banded with dark iron. 

Elsewhere, the camp spreads out in all other directions, several 
cook fires, numerous scaffoldings and wheel-barrows and any 
number of men visible as they go about their daily tasks. To the 
west, the beginning foundations of a small stone keep rises up 
like a broken tooth.

with cups and plates in their hands. In the distance men can be 
seen training.

timbers. Carts of tools and wagons full of hay and supplies are 
clustered together. Some men busily work here unloading, 
shoveling and working the wood, while others work the stones.

Foundations of the Keep~
   Built on a sturdy rock foundation rising shoulder height from 
the ground, a ramp from the east leads up and meets the 
foundation at the edge here, allowing for the easy access of 
wheelbarrows and other supplies. Workmen and tools are scattered 
throughout, while a tarp is stretched out over the open ceiling 
to protect against the elements.

north side of the bastion - the open expanse of the North 
Ithilien and the steep drop between it and you rushing closer.

not towards what would no doubt be a painful demise at the base 
of the cliffs, and instead catch on the ledge of the Plateau.

Gatehouse with a Shattered Portcullis~
   This square shaped gatehouse has been built into the outer 
wall, its narrow confines remaining hot, muggy and generally 
oppressive. A large fortified gate to the west serves as the 
last line of defense into the fortress. The area is watched by 
soldiers stationed in a guard post overhead through a series of 
small murderholes which can also be used to fire upon anyone 
here. A small shutter set into the gates allows one to peer 
outside. The ground has been laid with cut slabs of stone giving 
it an orderly and disciplined look, yet even these stones are 
marked with dark red stains.

An Open-Air, Large Courtyard~
   Hard-packed dirt forms the ground of this courtyard, no 
vegetation visible save for the odd weed against the firm 
grey-stone walls. A path, paved with sand-colored stones, makes 
a neat circle about the center of the courtyard, where a raised 
platform can be seen. In the corner sits a circular stone well, 
pulley system made from slightly warped wood and yellowed, tough 
hemp rope. Cone-like lantern fixtures are spaced evenly around 
the courtyard, tinted glass panes accented by dulled bronze 
frames. Thin slits have been made on both sides of the gate, 
carved into the stone with care.

The smell of wet dirt climbs into the air here, the unprotected parts
of the courtyard having been turned to soggy dirt or mud. The only
exceptions are the pavestones which make up the path about the platform,
their smell that of wet stone like the grey walls. The sound of water
dripping into water sounds faintly from the well in the corner, and
the open-topped lamps have been extinguished by the rain. Thin slits
gaze out of the eastern wall, beside the gate. Light is constant here,
a pair of shuttered lanterns illuminating the gate and slits day
and night.
~

Night creeps along the walls of this courtyard, the illumination
provided by the lanterns having the double effect of also casting
long shadows over the area. The hard-packed dirt upon the ground
captures the light in its small pebbles, reflecting the flame about
and illuminating the path which circles the platform. In the
corner, the well is dark, no lantern placed there to illuminate it.
Thin slits gaze out into the night on either side of the gatehouse,
a pair of lanterns brightly illuminating both them and the gate itself.

to a flat wooden roof, crossbeams holding it up. Beneath these are two 
symmetrical rows of large stalls, troughs visible within each. Separating

rain pattering against the roof and upon the ground outside filter
inside. The smell of wet straw pronounces the deliberate drip of
droplets leaking through the roof.

Rows of lanterns hang from hooks at the gate of each stable and on
either side of the arched entryway. Their gentle glow, tinged lightly
with yellow, bring to life the small illustrations carved into the
solid wood of the archway and the height of the flat wooden roof.
The crossbeams cast shadow upon the ceiling as they descend to
support the wide wooden stalls. A large pathway, strewn with hay,
appears able to comfortably bear a carriage. The smell of horses
rises strongly, the soft sounds of sleeping horses accompanying it.

A Cobbled Area Partly Covered by a Thatch Roof~
   Darkness falls heavily upon this area, away from the 
illumination of the northern courtyard. A few stray lanterns, 
shuttered against wind and elements, have been set among the many 
crates and other surfaces redolent in the clutter which inhabits 
this area. Still, they provide an adequate measure of light 
though it is not the brightest of areas. Shadows fall from the 
many barrels, straps, horseshoes, hammers, picks, shovels, 
shelves and other worn items cluttering up the space. A 
straw-thatched roof juts out from the southern wall, held by 
sturdy wooden posts as it runs from east to west. Twin lanterns 
have been set upon metal workbenches within, illuminating the 
area a bit more brightly than the rest. A narrow gate in the 
southern wall has been closed up recently with stone.

Quiet hangs over this space, away from the large courtyard to the
north. The cobbled stones covering the ground prevent this from 
becoming a muddy mess in the rain. The tinkling sound of water
falling onto metal and wood resonates through the area, as an
oftenly-seen clutter consisting of neatly stacked logs, barrels,
buckles, straps, horseshoes, worn tools, hooks, racks, shelves,
crates and other items lays about. Its rectangular length is
protected on the southern side by a straw-thatched roof held by
sturdy wooden posts which run the length of the wall, east to west.
The rain falls upon the roof, the wet straw absorbing the majority
though a few droplets occasional fall through into the workspace
below.

people which bustle through, on their way to various places or 
just stopping to rest. Soldiers of various rank and stature 
stand in groups or alone, catching up on the news, polishing 
weapons and generally keeping themselves busy. A large rug 
covers most of the floor, its slightly faded surface reflecting 
the amount of use it has received. A stone fireplace, set in the 
wall, provides warmth in the winter.

   A sense of quiet invades this area, despite the occasional clang of
metal as the soldiers of this fort leave and return from their duties. 
Small groups of soldiers sit on or around crates and stools, murmuring 
quietly. A stairwell at the far end of the room leads upwards. Two 
wooden doors are set in the northern and western portions of the room.
Cone-shaped lanterns are set, two upon each wall, giving off soft light 
from their blue-streaked glass panes. To the east, a door leads outside,
frequently opened and closed.

A Guest Room~
   Worn stones make up the square walls of this fairly spacious 
room, their surfaces dulled by time. Scratches are occasionally 
visible upon a stone here or there. Wooden panels of a sand hue 
have been inserted about the area in a likening of windows in an 
effort to make it seem more open. A rug, its worn blue surface 
still retaining some warmth, is lain upon the ground. Three 
lanterns hang from the walls, their diamond shape standing out in 
the otherwise plain room.

A Wide, Open Hallway~
   A long, thin carpet makes its way down this spacious hallway, 
the stones on either side free of grime or dust. Benches line 
the hall, as well as a few cots. Tapestries hang on the walls, 
lanterns set between them, their blue-tinged glass panes casting 
a cool light on the area. The roof reaches high above, giving an 
impression of open space. At the far end of the room a stairwell 
curves down, its passage lined with lanterns.

A Dining Hall~
   Chaotic and impossibly loud, this mess hall has all the 
dignity of a pig trough. Soldiers of all sizes hurry or stroll 
past, shoveling down their food or savoring it accordingly. Long 
tables are set throughout the room, benches providing seats for 
those with the time to sit. Casks and barrels are stacked on one 
end of the room, some with taps to draw their contents. The room 
is illuminated with several large candle wheels hanging from the 
ceiling. This light is reflected off the stone floor, the polish 
not coming from any cleanliness but rather from a mix of 
excessive use and spilled liquids. A door is set in the northern 
corner of the room.

A Cluttered Kitchen~
   Immediately filling one's nostrils as they enter this 
cluttered, wide space, is the aroma of food. Large pots of 
stews, broth, stock bearing all types of meat and vegetables 
simmer on kitchen stoves lit in braziers fed with a crackling 
fire of yellow-orange. Counters sprawl around the outskirts of 
the block-granite walls, their surfaces strewn with pots, pans, 
cutlery, gristle, vegetable cuttings and a wider variety of jars 
and smaller boxes. Along the walls shelves and racks have been 
organized in a more orderly fashion: herb-racks segregated into 
colors; raw ingredients and other packets of condiments and 
seasoning.

A Spiraled Stairwell of Thick Granite Blocks~
   Cobwebs and dust choke shadowy corners not lit by flickering 
torchlight through the entirety of this musky stairwell. Narrow 
in creation, the steps are fashioned from hefty blocks of 
thistle-gray granite and wind their steep ascent in a clockwise 
manner, though those that come through can only see a little way 
in front of the tiered platforms that wind their way around the 
vast pillar in this room's center. Torches crackle in their 
dusky gratings on the wall revealing a blunted sword with an 
ornate hilt here or a decorative shield there.

A Narrow, Clockwise Stairwell Opening onto Battlements~
   As one ascends this narrow, spiraled stairwell in a clockwise 
fashion the musky, drab air seems to vanish, replaced by the 
fresh outside air. Hence, the uppermost steps of the stairwell 
are bereft of dust and muck, a large rectangular space opening 
out onto the battlements above. The steps which creep up around 
a central pillar are crafted of thick blocks of granite, making 
them quite high. 
   A hardwood door banded with iron leads into a gatehouse to the

A Guardpost Over the Gatehouse~
   This narrow guardpost is built into the wall of the fortress
atop the gatehouse.  Cold stone walls and floors offer little
comfort to the soldiers stationed here. Arrow slits line the walls
allowing a clear view of anyone approaching the fortress from the 
east or the courtyard to the west. Built into the floor is a row 
of murderholes that would allow those stationed here to rain upon
death onto anyone in the gatehouse. A gate winch here controls the 
main gate.

A Cool, Wide Hallway~
   This hallway is wide but short, running only a few doors 
before stopping abruptly at a heavy, metal-barred door to the 
north. The cold stones which make up the ground offer no warmth 
or heat, their presence doing more to create a chill. Lanterns 
are liberally placed about the hallway, lighting each and every 
corner of this sparse corridor. A stairwell runs up in the 
corner of the room.

A Cold, Dark Prison~
   Large, moldy stones line the wall, their scummy, grimy surface 
doing nothing to dispel the damp, stifling air in the windowless 
room. The ground is strewn with old hay, refuse and waste 
scattered about its surface and around the corners of the room. 
Stains mar the clean grey of the floor, some a dark brown in 
color, others of lighter color. The door to the south is a 
heavily reinforced, metal-barred door, a single small hatch at 
the bottom and a tiny, barred window at its top the only links to 
the outside world.

Within a Quiet Cellar~
   The few lanterns in the room cast a dim light over the pale- 
colored stones comprising the walls, moisture gathering near the 
point where the walls meets the ceiling. Steep, wide stairs lead 
upwards, where only thin streams of light manage to show through 
the cracks of a heavy wooden trapdoor. Muffled noises penetrate 
the thick wood from time to time, but more often, the cellar is 
almost completely silent when the trapdoor is closed. Cluttered 
with supplies, shelves and barrels, the already small room seems 
tinier still with the items strewn within it.

An Armoury~
   This area is well-lit and kept clean and neat. There are a 
few shelves filled with armor and weapons of all sorts set on 
the southern wall. To the east and west are archways leading 
further into the armoury, their path lined with diamond-shaped 
lanterns. A low roof made of cold grey stone is supported by 
the rounded doorway to the north. Upon the door itself, small 
inscriptions are carved along the sides. A small statuette sits 
on one of the shelves, bearing a small shield.

Lower Men's Barracks~
   Bunk beds are lined up in twin rows against the walls, two lidded 
crates underneath each one. The light of several lanterns, placed high on 
the walls, illuminates the sparsely furnished room. The room is filled with 
the bustling noise of soldiers arming themselves, jeering at each other and 
laughing at the newest rumor. Those who lay in their beds are undisturbed, 
deep in exhausted slumber. The dark wood floor is unadorned and bare, worn 
and polished by the hundreds of feet which have tread upon it. A staircase 
spirals down in the northwest corner.

   A musty smell permeates this room, the old smell of decay and 
rot. The stone walls are grimy, several stones having come 
loose, and bits of stones sit on the ground, moss covering them.

humidity in the air. Within are rusted weapons and armor, their 
useability destroyed by time. Upon the northern wall is a small

an effort to provide more warmth to the room. Lanterns are set 
between each row of beds, high on the wall, their dusky panes 
softening the light of the candle within.

At the Top of a Spiral Stair~
   A spiral staircase leads down here. It is constructed of grey
stone and has no ornamentation or handrail. Simple oil lamps are
spaced at regular intervals along the wall to light the way. 
There is very little evidence that it is used often, but it seems
to be well maintained nonetheless. A solid wood door stands to
the west.

A Smoky, Well-Lit Room~
   A stairwell leads up into this well-lit room, the stone steps 
continuing upwards. A rug has been spread out over the floor, 
its non-descript tan coloring matching the sparsity of this space 
perfectly. A table is set in the center of the room, while a 
desk is in the corner, its chair old and worn. A single statue 
of a soldier holding coins in his hands, a grin on his face, is 
the only adornment. Light pours forth from the torches set in 
sconces about the room, their low smoke trailing away along the 
roof.

A Small, Oak-Paneled Sitting Room~
   This room seems to have been remodeled recently, fresh milled
birch lumber has been used to erect walls dividing the room into
several smaller chambers. Ornate tapestries line the walls of this 
room, the quality and skill of the artist evident. Two elongated, 
sinuous lamps rest on blackened metal hooks on either side of the 
room. The door leading out is made of fine oak, carvings upon its 
frame.

A Large Bedroom~
   Several shields, hung prominently upon the cold walls, stand 
out in this spacious room. The high, sloped ceiling holds 
several chandeliers though a few lay empty. One massive carpet 
covers the entire area of the floor, the scenes of battle 
depicted upon it not countering the warmth its presence brings. 
A few desks have been shoved against a wall, by a polished bronze 
statue of a figure holding a scimitar across its chest. The door 
is banded with metal.

cedar door shutting out much of the noise of the outside. Clear 
illumination shows a small but cozy room, a small fireplace set 
into the southern wall. Small, thin rugs have been set in a 
series of lines across the room. Twin tables have been set in 
the northern area of the room, a few chairs by the fireplace. A

A Large, High Ceilinged Room~
   This sizable chamber is decorated with a plain, spartan 
beauty, clearly a room built for defense despite its furnishings. 
A thick, warm rug covers the cold stone of the floor, while 
tapestries bearing scenes of armored men line the walls. The 
southern wall is dominated by a sizable fireplace, while along 
the western wall, an arrow slit looks out upon the grassy fields 
outside the keep.

Archer Hoarding~
   Spartan and effective in design, this overhang is formed of 
stout, aged timbers and wooden planks. A railing helps prevent 
the unwary from falling out, while wooden walls aid in guarding 
the men within. Hatches and gaps provide for an open and clear 
view of the Garrison Courtyard below.

A Stone Stairwell~
   Cold walls line this stairway, a reinforced oaken door set in 
the side. A few sconces bearing torches light the way, the high 
ceiling enveloped in near-darkness however. A chill bounces off

Atop the Central, Crenelated Watch Tower~
   This point is set higher than any other, giving one a 
magnificent view of the surrounding area. Parapets line the 
walls, and a wooden roof provides little shelter from the 
elements, its panels having molded or rotted away some time ago. 
A few brave braziers vainly attempt to provide warmth when called 
upon.

Upon the West Garrison Wall, Overlooking the Vast Forest~
Lanterns that are ensconced into the base of each merlon cast light 
upon the sturdy gray stone of the ramparts.The pathway itself is 
well-illuminated as well, allowing easy passage for soldiers. To the 
east, the central keep rises up in the night,illuminated against the 
dark. A stout, reinforced oak door grants access, two lanterns set on 
either side, while to the west the dark forest of Ithilien stretch out, 
rapidly slithering beyond the reach of light.

Rain batters down upon the grey stones of the ramparts which provide
protection for the archers atop the pathway. Rainwater has made the
stones of the path slick, another hazard to worry about. To the east,
the central keep stands firm, ignoring the elements with the fortitude
of a giant. A stout, reinforced oak door grants access into the keep,
while to the west the forests of Ithilien south of the Morgulduin
stretch out, meeting the Anduin river against the backdrop of distant
Osgiliath.

North Wall Overlooking the Morgulduin~
   The view is magnificent; it is from this point that a lookout 
can watch the lands from here to the dark swamps of the distant 
north for signs of movement by the enemy. The dark waters of the 
Morgulduin wind across the ithilien to the north, and far behind 
it, the ruins of another Garrison of similar construction, beyond 
even that are the hills and swamps of the northern Ithilien. The 
battlements are made of stone and the walls are extremely thick, 
likely to be able to take quite a pounding, yet already scarred 
and stained by years of warfare. The crenelations hold a small 
hollow within each of their protective bodies.

   Night sky stretches on until it meets the horizon in the distance,
the lands between it and this lookout clearly visible during daylight.
At night, small pinpoints of light and the occasional reflection of
the moon against some distant object or river are the only things
truly visible. A dark impression of Ithilien stands against the night,
forebodingly staring back between the hills and rises. The

The Sheltered Recess of the Wall's Northeast Corner~
   This small, sandstone tower is riddled with several dark 
arrow-slits of mismatching darker stone. The walls curve 
slightly inward near the top of the tower, creating a sheltering 
overhang against arrow shots from the north and east. Near the 
base of the wall, a narrow channel leads through the stone, an 
opening to pour smouldering pitch upon any enemy who treads the 
path around the keep. Within the sheltered corner, a narrow, 
spiral staircase leads down into the depths of the Garrison wall.

   Riddled with several dark arrow-slits of mismatching darker stone,
this small, sandstone tower stands firm in the night. The walls
curve slightly inward near the top of the tower, creating a sheltering
overhang against arrow shots from the north and east. Light also 
bounces back from the curve, illuminating the corner surprisingly 
well. Near the base of the wall, a narrow channel leads through the 
stone, an opening to pour smouldering pitch upon any enemy who 
treads the path around the keep. Within the sheltered corner, a

the Black Mountains taking on a sinister air in the dark of night,
the darkness seeming more black where they stand. The long, snaking
Harad road is visible only in small sections, the rest hidden to
darkness. The sounds of the river and the small light produced by the
fortified bridge over it give testament to the entrance of the dreaded
Morgul Vale. The ramparts here are thick and stout, numerous etched
crescent moons and spiral lines decorating its otherwise imposing
features. Light spills from lanterns and braziers set along the wall.

present as slick a surface as possible for grappling hooks. To 
the south, the forest has been cut short within bow's reach, 
while to the north, the great central spire of the Keep rises 
above, magnificent in its arching curves. Below, the wall angles 
out, giving a clear view of any would be climber, while at the 
base a hump helps prevent the use of ladders and siege weapons.

   The southern wall of this garrison is tall and well-fortified.
The stones are solid, wide and carefully smooth out so as to
present as slick a surface as possible for grappling hooks. The
falling rain merely enhances the purpose, damp, slick stones
promising no grip for boot, hand or hook. A hazard presents itself
as the rain falls, however, the pathway following the inside of the
wall slick as well. Muddy ground lies to the south, cleared land
between the Ithilien forest and the wall. The great central spire
of the keep rises into the rain to the north, its magnificent arching
curves dripping rainwater.

   The southern wall of this garrison is tall and well-fortified.
The stones are solid, wide, and carefully smoothed out so as to
present as slick a surface as possible for grappling hooks. Small
hooks appear to have been recently dug into the stone at regular
intervals along the wall, about midway up from the pathway. Lanterns
hang from them, illuminating the path. Braziers provide warmth and 
more light, exposing the edges of the southern forest and the 
cleared land which provides no cover between it and the wall. 
The great central spire of the keep rises to challenge Ithil, its
arching  curves made all the more magnificent in the dim light.

The Southwest Corner~
   Of stalwart build, this corner tower is overshadowed by the 
great stone spire rising out above. The crenellated battlements 
stretch out to the east and north along the walls, but curve 
inward here to provide a sheltered overlook of the dirt path 
below. The stone underfoot and forming the walls appears to be 
recently laid, but even so, several small cracks, chips and 
scorch marks are visible. The Emyn Arnen hills are visible in

Stalwartly built, this corner tower is overshadowed by the great
stone spire rising above. Small droplets of water drip from its edge
onto the slick pathway below, unnoticeable in the falling rain. The
crenellated battlements stretch out to the east and north along the
walls, their own surfaces miserably wet as they curve inwards here
to provide a sheltered overlook of the dirt path below. The stone

even so, several small cracks, chips and scorch marks are visible

Climbing over the Southern Battlements~
   From this vantage point, the dark forests of the South 
Ithilien forest seem to linger all too close, despite the low-cut 
fields surrounding the keep. The wall here is smooth to provide 
little-purchase to climbers, thicker at the base to provide no 
shelter for an assault, and strengthened against the 
possibilities of ram or siege tower. Altogether, it is an 
uninviting place to linger. Luckily, it seems that you will not 
have to worry about that for long.

purchase to a climber. None the less, it angles slightly 
outward, a facet that would have otherwise helped said climber - 
save perhaps for the alternate detail that it also provides the 
wall watchers an easy sight of any who attempt such a feat. At 
the base of the wall, and strikingly ominious in your current 
predicament, is a hump of stone that stretches out beyond the 
walls base, preventing rams and siege towers from resting 
directly against the wall.

Lift Platform~
   Slapped together with nails and thick, crisscrossed wooden 
planks, this lift has been thrown together as a quick exercise in 
engineering. A messy system of pulleys and ropes support the 
lifting platform's operation, but the main lines can be hoisted 
or slackened by a untrained operator. Controlled through the use 
of leverage on the ropes, it can also be halted by tying the main 
line in question's slack around some of the allocated iron knobs 
to hold it in a safe, if a little shaky, position above the 
ground at any point. While up in the air, there is nothing to 
hold onto but the side supporting ropes, the odd bit of leather 
wrapped around for a better grip for its passengers.

In Murky Water~
   Rock forms the walls of this underground lake, its massive

rocks form the main walls, coming together high above into a 
ceiling. A single, small, round hole has been carefully carved 
into the stone, the source of the well. The water around is cold 
and murky, the darkness doing little to help perception. The 
weight of thousands of pounds of rock crush downards, the dead 
air stale. Silence, save for the occasional drip of water, rules 
this place.

dramatically a few paces in. It progressively narrows as well, 
until it becomes only wide enough for a single man to walk

sprout dangerously forward, promising harm to any who slip upon 
the dirt-littered path.

A Narrow Tunnel~
   Small cracks rise up the walls here, the pressure seeming

drops from the pockmarked ceiling. An old, rusty sconce is set 
up high on the left side of the tunnel, hanging outwards just in 
reach. Cobwebs litter the space, both old and new. Light seems 
to be absorbed by the stone, extending only a few paces outwards 
before being swallowed by the dead, stale air and the consant 
overhanging threat of the thousands of pounds of rock above.

above, whatever caused it taking a considerable chunk of the 
floor with it. Two posts are tied at both ends of the chasm, an 
old and frail pair of ropes providing the only means across. The 
chasm itself falls below into darkness. A single torch-sconce, 
rusty and cobwebbed, hangs to the side of the tunnel.

A Jutting Ledge~
   The rope bridge ends shortly here, passing between the 
waterfalls to the south as it reaches this rock outcropping in 
the massive cave wall. Rounded, an old rusty rail once stood, 
protecting from the danger of falling. Now it lies in pieces, 
most of it weakened by time some of it entirely gone. The rock 
ground leads onwards towards the hole in the wall, leading

In a Narrowing Tunnel~
   The sound of falling water echoes down from the opening in the 
wall a little further up the tunnel. Hardly being worthy of the 
name, this passageway rather rapidly narrows, forcing anybody to 
move by in a single-file line. Sharp rocks jutting out from the 
walls and ground make the passage rather difficult, and the deep 
crevices which promise a sudden trip and fall dot the ground. 
The tunnel leads further onwards, the ceiling still fairly high.

   Light filters in from a small crevice in the ceiling above, be

rushing sounds of water can be heard very near. A massive gap in 
the floor prevents access onwards to the tunnel, the pit below 
full of sharp, jagged rocks and hard stone slabs. Only a tiny, 
narrow portion of the floor remains, barely enough to hold a 
rather agile person's feet. Making this even more difficult, a 
gap exists between the ground and the ledge, forcing one to jump

rising up from the pool. The water itself is fraught with

A Small, Weathered Storefront~
   This storefront has obviously been built without comfort in 
mind. Cramped, the room smells faintly of mold, inescapable for 
lack of windows. A few shelves, filled with old junk, line the 
sides of the room. The floor is covered in dust, the wood long 
since warped. A single door leads out.

A Narrow Alley~
   This short, narrow alley is dark at all times. Two buildings 
rise up on either side, their roofs joining above to provide 
cover from the sun though not from the weather. The width of the 
alley is just enough to allow a single person across. The ground 
is littered with refuse, rats darting to and fro.

A Low Valley~
   This low valley is a carpet of high grass, green in summer and 
yellow in winter. Two hills rise up on either side, like massive 
statues challenging the sky above. Trees hold firm roots down 
the sides of the hills. These end at the valley floor, shy of 
touching each other. Rocks can be seen interspersed along the 
field, moss growing upon their hard surfaces. A single, massive 
oak tree rises up higher than any other, its great trunk the 
width of two men.

Atop the Western Hill~
   The grass atop this hill is rather long, coming up to a Man's 
thigh. Trees dot the hill itself, becoming more numerous as one 
follows the path of the hill to the valley below. The height 
itself is not very large, enough to perhaps accomodate a camp 
comfortably. The sounds of wildlife echo from all about, 
rabbits, birds and various other beasts visible as they go about 
their lives in this part of Ithilien. Directly opposite, to the 
east, another hill rises up fom the valley below.

Atop the Eastern Hill~
   Visible in the distance, a long river stretches its way 
through the woods, valleys and hills of Ithilien. This hill 
rises up from the valley to the west, long grass coating its 
surface and its height. Trees grow at an angle down the incline 
on all sides, though they grow much more numerous as one descends 
to the valley. A sweeping view can be seen from here of the 
surrounding areas. The sounds of wildlife darting past can be 
heard, and directly opposite to the west another hill rises up.

A Long Trench~
   This long trench has been hastily widened, piles of dirt and 
mud still visible upon both sides. It is about the breadth of 
two men, just deep enough to cover the majority of a man's body. 
The ground is a muddy, squelching, unstable area. The trench 
continues to the south. Trees rise up on all sides, impeding 
easy vision to the east while to the west it seems as if the 
trees have been purposefully thinned. Some stumps are still 
visible.

A Long, Central Trench~
   Running north to south, the two extremities of the trench meet 
here. The trench itself is fairly high, covering a Man's body up 
to his neck. It is approximately two Men wide, the ground below 
muddy and unstable. Piles of mud and dirt still litter the area 
just above and within, and the sides are rather slippery. A 
single opening has been formed, leading up and out of the trench 
onto Ithilien to the east. The trench itself continues to the 
north and south, running on. The Lond ends abruptly at the edge 
of the trench and continues on the other side.

   Long, muddy sides, hard-packed yet still slippery, make up the 
walls of this two-Man wide trench. The ground below is also 
rather muddy and unstable, dug to allow a Man to cover himself 
from the neck down. Piles of mud and dirt rise up upon the outer 
edges, and trees obscure easy view to the east. To the west they 
seem to have been purposefully thinned, some stumps still 
visible. The trench continues running northwards.

   Where the stone here has failed fresh wood has been put into 
place, patching empty places where this buildings' architecture

but sturdy-enough to serve the few horses that are here. The 
scent is of animals and leathers, with the walls dominated by 
large iron hooks for tack and tools to be hung. A door marks the 
room's exit, swinging on stiff-brass hinges that creak against 
any use.

A Modest Pantry~
   Perfect for storage, if for little else, this square room is 
flanked by walls of battered grey stone. The floor is made of 
large stone tiles, the mortar that once sealed them together all 
but entirely missing from time's cruel touch. Regardless, 
spacious and relatively neat despite the thin layer of dust along 
the stone, it is suitable for things to be placed here. A single 
bracket bearing a torch provides illumination, and to the south 
the kitchen is visible.

Silvermoon Private - Humam~
Name- Humam
Rank-Private
#5a lean, midnight-skinned man#0

#6Description-#0
This dark-skinned man stands at considerable height. He has a 
bald shaven head completely absent of hair and his face shows 
the fine lines of age at the corners of his eyes. He is almost 
entirely darkly-featured with a black beard on his face and dark 
brown eyes, the lightest feature is a pinkish scar across his throat. 
His posture is firm, and his features are those of a middle-aged 
man who has weathered a harsh life.

#3Background-#0
Having grown up on the plains, Humam joined the Dervish at the 
age of 18 and has served nearly twenty years protecting his 
people and lands. Never married and never really fond of settling 
down, Humam usually takes to the women he enslaves and as 
such, has a fondness for mongrel women with his only -real- 
sense of emotion besides being a soldier is his lust for them. Most 
of the time, Humam is found standing firmly at attention and 
aggressively disciplining the other soldiers, if he is having fun, its 
probably in the kitchen stealing grabs at the mongrel women, 
who have 'softer' skin than their Haradrim counterparts.

Silvermoon Private - Ayman~
Name- Ayman
Rank-Private
#5a fire-scarred, mangled figure#0

#6Description-#0
His skin withered and flesh pulled tight across his bones, this 
figure seems to be a man in which little features remain. His 
eyebrows have been singed off and his visible body is mostly 
hairless save for patches of what appears to be finely curling 
black hair. His face is entirely scarred and burns run down his 
body to his torso. Despite his mangled appearance, the man 
stands tall and firm.

#3Background-#0
Ayman (meaning lucky) was burnt terribly as a child when a 
mongrel woman who served his mother spilled boiling water onto 
him in a kitchen accident. Ayman has a hatred of mongrels since, 
all of them are incompetent and unable to complete whatever 
task. Besides this hatred, Ayman has taken on a charming and 
sociable personality to make up for his physical deformity quite 
proudly boasting what little hair he has is good hair and that the 
scars he has will not not affect the 'beautiful children' he could 
produce. He is flirtatious and enjoys a good drink.

Silvermoon Private - Azhar~
Name- Azhar
Rank-Private
#5a firm-postured, dusky-toned man#0

#6Description-#0
A dusky-toned man stands here with firm posture. Of an average 
build, this man is lean and well-muscled. His entire form is tense 
with broad shoulders. His dark hair and skin are contrasted with 
blue eyes, seemingly out of place on this man who otherwise 
holds a deep shade of brown. His features are extremely well-
defined with hair tapering carefully on the sides with a carefully 
controlled goatee and sideburns.

#3Background-#0
Azhar is a perfectionist. Born into a family of ten sons, he had to 
find a way to stand out to his father. The seventh child of the 
bunch, he is extremely needy of attention. He constantly shines 
his armor and boots to near obsession and has only been known 
to cease his cleaning when ordered to the front lines, which in 
that case, he sets up a tent of his own, carefully arranging various 
'good luck' charms that coincide with his religion.

Silvermoon Private - Abubakar~
Name - Abubakar
Rank - Private

#5a broad-framed, tall swarthy man#0

#6Description-#0 
This man stands about the average height for one of his 
heritage. Swarthy skin covers an expanse of muscled chest, broad 
shoulders and a thick torso. A meaty neck leads to a strong 
chin. Sharp features accent this man's face comprised of a thin 
nose, angled eyebrows and thin lips that conceal several broken 
and missing teeth. Long legs add height to his thick build 
although his ankles are not noticeable; the leg merely turns into 
foot. 

#2Background-#0
A man originally of humble origins, Abukbakar was 
born to a secluded family in the JAveed regions near Umbar.
Growing up on the farms as a boy he always wanted for
something more, the farm work well hard was not fulfilling he
was built for something else. He was made for battle. Leaving
the farms he abandoned his family and everything he knew in 
hope of finding something that would appease his restless soul.
He was soon snapped up by he Silvermoon Dervish and found
joy in battle be it orkin, betrayers or west man he does not care
so long as their blood runs along his blade.

Silvermoon Private - Bahiti~
Name-Bahiti
Rank- Private
#5 a thin, black-haired, earthen skinned young man #0
#6Description-#0
Along, thin limbs dangle from this mans torso when not busy 
with some other task. Although he is not especially tall, he looks 
it due to a lean, almost scantly-built body, more lanky then 
anything he seems to have grown some tight corded muscle along 
his arms and legs. A long neck leads up to oddly square facial 
features; a very strong boxy chin seems to be devoid of stubble.
His eyebrows are angled and black in the usual Haradrim 
fashion. 

#3Background-#0
Hailing from Jah'Anshah, Bahiti was the son of a mercenary 
and whore. His father unknown to him he was raised in the back
of his mothers place of work. Food and compassion was scarce
for him. Steady on his way to becoming a womanizer he was 
thrown out by his mother and into the streets. Unskilled, talented 
and nothing but his smooth tongue to assist his way he signed up
as a recruit for the Silvermoon, not exceptional or disciplined 
Bahiti is a soldier in the sense that he works for his coin, spends it
on drink and woman then fights for more.

Silvermoon Private - Fenuku~
Name- Fenuku
Rank- Private
#5 a rangy, coffee-skinned man with war braids#0

#6Description-#0
The word to describe this man's body would be 'rangy'. Short 
limbs, covered in coffee colored skin accent boast compact 
muscle accented with a lean appearance. Long dark hair falls 
about his shoulders, kept at bay only by a series of war braids 
that further depict this man as a warrior. Angled raven eyebrows 
sit atop murky brown eyes that pair out with a slight glaze.

#3Background-#0
The fourth son of a chief Fenuku was raised to help his other 
brother lead the hunt. Taught to use his weapons and use them 
well he was a strong member of his tribe in mind and body. His 
tribe that is, until they left him for dead after a hunting accident. 
Had it not been for the kindness of a passing stranger Feneku 
would never have made it to B'ahed where the dervish recruiters 
spotted his warrior-like appearance and brought him into the 
northern armies.

Rank-Private
#5 a tall and hardy, dark-skinned man #0

#6Description-#0
Set upon a pair of lanky legs, this mans upper body is quite 
compact, ripped with muscle his body is covered in dark-skin 
announcing his heritage which, by the way he holds himself erect 
and staunch could be discerned as something this man is proud 
of. His eyes seem to shine with a strange light, alternating 
between black and brown depending on lighting conditions. A 
lone scar cleaves this mans face running from left to right across a 
broken nose, distorting what might have once been good looks.

#3Background-#0
A privileged Haradrim of Teymour Geb lived a happy life under 
his father rich merchants' coin up until the bloodline of the family 
was discovered and they were set to be slaughtered. Catching 
word of this Geb fled the city, knowing no where else to go he 
headed north for Mordor. Before he was able to get very far 
though he was swindled into the soldiering life and added to the 
ranks of the famous Silvermoon Dervish.

Silvermoon Private - Hapi~
Name-Hapi
Rank-Private
#5 a lean and narrow-framed man with a harsh tan#0

#6Description-#0
The first thing noticeable about this mans appearance is strikingly 
black-skin which appears to have suffered more then its fair 
share of hardships. Heavy calluses and thick scares linger on his 
entire body, boasting a life of labor and hard existence. Thick lips 
grace this mans face below a beefy nose. His eyebrows are 
nearly non-existent although what is there to speak of does meet 
in the middle of his face.

#3Background-#0
Son of a farmer, Hapi was always the athletic type. Capturer of 
every girl in the area's heart he managed to get himself into a spot 
of trouble with their fathers for his 'feats of manhood'. It was not 
long however before mothers and the woman themselves added 
to the list of player haters so Hapi decided it was time to cut and 
run. After traveling for awhile, womanizing and making a general 
scoundrel of himself he wound up in the military, taking up a 
soldiers lifestyle he enjoys drinking, womanizing and killing.

Name-Ishaq
Rank- Private
#5a soil-skinned, basalt-haired man#0

#6Description-#0
Dense grey-black hair sits upon this mans head, a tangled and 
seemingly uncared for mess that hangs loosely about his head, 
often obscuring his view and others of his facial features. Skin 
that seems to vary in shade depending on where you look covers 
this mans form, similar to that as dark, wet soil. Muscled and 
energetic this man seems to speak of the wonder of youth.

#3Background-#0
Ta'Aher through and through Ishaq upholds all the ideals of his 
people. Leaving the plains reluctantly he traveled with his family 
northward to help in the battle against the hated west. After a 
long travel with his father, mother and brother Kamuzu they 
arrived in mordor and were recruited into the dervish, the fighting 
males earning coin and respect to care for the woman of their 
family.

high over those about him. His height seeming to have graced this 
man with confidence his mouth is almost always turned up in a 
crooked, cocky grin which adds a slightly roguish air to this 
man's actions. Boasting a thick chest and broad shoulders 
strength is obviously on this mans side, if coordination seems to 
escape his grasp. His thighs are thick as tree trunks and speak of 
agility substituted yet again for strength.

#3Background-#0
Less attached to his heritage as his brother, Kamuzu has taken to 
the K'Amy'Ar and soldiers lifestyle well. Enjoying politics, 
woman, drink and naturally the fight he fits into the dervish as just 
another soldier in the ranks, aside from his appearance and odd 
strange mannerism he is the same as any other serving.

Rank-Private
#5 a strapping, coal-bearded man with swarthy skin #0

#6Description-#0
A thick beard dyed the color of coal covers this mans cheeks 
and chin, meeting with his hair it completes the full-faced beard. 
This mans thickly muscled body is covered with a thin layer of 
flab, swarthy skin and dark hair. A grim expression seems to play 
on his features often hinting at past hardships.
#3Background-#0
With a name like Lisimba, the lion could never be content with 
the simple J'Aveed lifestyle. Learning to fight from passing 
mercenaries he bribed with food and what little coin he had. At 
the young age of fourteen he traveled to the K'Amy'Ar cities and 
ended up running with street gangs, the rough lifestyle suited him 
until he was imprisoned and later forced into military service with 
the Dervish, defiant, mischievous and generally disrupting at first 
the harsh training procedures of the unit ended up turning him into 
a hardened soldier.

Name-Makalani
Rank-Private
#5 a towering, harshly tanned man#0

#6Description-#0
Tall and lanky this main peers over the heads of many men. 
Looking about with an often distant look he seems to have the 
feel of a simpleton about him. A stupid grin is often found on his 
features as he regards the on goings about him. His skin is 
smooth, not flawed by scars or other signs of hardship.

#3Background-#0
Born in the deserts of Far Harad, Makalani suffered a harsher 
lifestyle then most. Every day was a battle for survival, food, 
water and other necessities simply did not hold out for long in 
such a place for living. Finally becoming fed up with the hot, 
hardening conditions he traveled west, heading for the lands 
where battle rages between great powers. The hated west men 
and scum of Mordor. Finding little liking to the cities where 
politics and treachery ran amuck Makalani headed for the north 
with the military, the dervish spotted him as a resourceful man 
and claimed them into their own ranks.

Silvermoon Private - Cheops~
Name- Cheops
Rank- Private
#5a long black-haired, hazel-eyed man#0

#6Description-#0
Hazel hues pair out from beneath thin eyebrows. Bronzed skin
covers this mans features and when displayed, body. His features
are square and boxlike. A dark creamy skin covers his body, 
slightly paler then that of a usual man of his supposed heritage. 
Marked with scars his body seems to have seen some hardships, 
heavily calloused hands link to thick, hairy forearms.

#3Background-#0
Born in the plains, Cheops holds his head high with the usual 
Ta'Aher pride. Possessive and controlling he is slow to trust and 
quick to take command. After his tribe started to fall apart from 
poor leadership and lack of food or water due to other tribes in 
the area laying claim to the resources he found himself wandering 
northward, and like many of the men of the plains found himself 
snapped up by the Dervish.

Name-Narmer
Rank- Private
#5a dun-skinned man with a widow's peak #0

#6Description-#0
Short, roughly cut hair displays this mans widow's peak clearly to 
all those about him, the distinct hairstyle adds a wolf-like feel to 
his features, which are already sleek. A lean body suggests 
coordination and speed are two weapons this man uses freely. 
Numerous scars adorn his brown skin. His legs are long and 
dexterous, speaking of long travels and hard work.

#3Background-#0
Born of privledged blood, Narmer was never told it, if by his 
parent's shame or ignorance one cannot be sure but he was 
raised in a wealthy family all the same. Third son of his father he 
was never destined to be special and found little interest in his 
families dealings which were usually shady to say the least. 
Departing his family home in Behd'ad he signed up for military 
service, being of physical build he felt it was a good chance to 
serve his people in the dervish.

Rank- Private
#5a broad-shouldered, pitch-skinned man#0

#6Description-#0
Of muscular build and striking appearance this mans combination 
of pitch-black skin, long; muscled arms, legs and body make him 
quite the sight to behold. Seeming to be built for one purpose, 
physical tasks he seems to have the right median for great 
strength, speed and coordination. A thin beard plays along his 
jaw line in a well-kept display

#3Background-#0
From a tribe that shifted from the harsh plains to Teymour they 
traded in the near inhospitable conditions for the quick-paced, 
hustle and bustle of the city. Raised a plainsman with the taint of 
the city in the upbringing he never really found his place within 
both sides of culture. Lacking the intelligence or patience to take 
up a craft it was military service that caught this mans eye. One 
thing that Onuris wasn't confused about was his hate for the west 
men. He was consumed like many young Harad warriors with 
that hate, which is what lead him to the Silvermoon dervish's 
ranks.

#5an angular, sparsely muscled man with dark skin #0

#6Description-#0
Sharp features of angular proportions make up the sight that 
this mans face. Thin and sleek in design streamlined with a
hawkish look. His body however is sparsely muscled; instead he 
seems to have traded-in space for such to for flab. Covering his 
thick layer of fat is dark skin; both heavily tanned and scarred he 
looks like a man with a few seasons under his belt.

#3Background-#0
Born in the slums of Behd'ad Ptolemy's life growing up was an 
urban fight for survival food, water were hard to come by and 
oppression from other slummers was a daily threat. Wit, speed, 
and intelligence are the qualities that brought this logical mind out 
of the slums and into a reasonable lifestyle. Taking up his hand at 
peddling he began to make money, and even found a girl. 
Unfortunately the girl's fathered not yet her marry just anyone, he 
wanted his daughter a man of honor. Driven by his love and 
desire to prove himself as more then a slum dog, Ptolemy signed 
up to the soldiers life and was sent to serve in the north.

Name-Serapis
Rank-Private
#5a severe, tar-skinned man with a short beard #0

#6Description-#0
A high-strung and intense feeling lingers about this mans form. Be 
it the sharp, hawkish features or the intense goal-eyed gaze he 
casts about him in a vigilant search. A smirk is often found 
playing on this mans lips, which are in fact adorned by a short, 
thick beard. Long limbs can boast more then their fair share of 
muscle and appearance, seeming to bulge with every movement.

#3Background-#0
With Far Harad in his blood, Far Harad in his upbringing, 
Serapis holds up their ideals and beliefs to the letter. Disallowing 
the taint of the K'Amy'Ar, J'Aveed or even the similar Ta'aher 
to affect him he serves as a harsh, uncaring man that wishes only 
to further himself. Proessive and skeptical he trusts no one, not 
since his natural Harad suspicion was peaked by his family being 
slaughtered by his best friend. His friend fled west and 
disappeared. Driven by Hate Serapis followed him with the intent 
to kill. Failing in his mission he decided enough was enough, his 
family was gone and their killer disappeared so, with that he 
decided it was time to serve himself. Skilled as a warrior and 
scout he was found to be a good addition to the ranks of the 
northern Harad armies.

Silvermoon Private - Alhasan~
Name-Alhasan
Rank-Private
#5a bald, bushy-bearded man#0

#6Description-#0
A dark glean shows on this mans dark-skinned, bald head. 
Balancing out the lack of hair in the area is a thick, bushy bead 
that covers the bottom half of this mans face with onyx-black 
hair. Short and compact, this man looks to be able to both deal 
out a harsh beating and receive one. Perched below short black 
eyebrows are a set of steel black eyes, shining with an intense 
glow they are probably the most interesting thing about this mans 
visage

#3Background-#0
Son of a Dervish Officer, Alhasan was always fated to follow in 
his fathers footsteps as a soldier. Although he tried to branch off 
into other interests such straying was quickly nipped at the bud 
by his harsh father. Raised by the scimitar he now lives by it as a 
soldier. Brought up to fit into the masses he has no special 
personality trait or physical appearance that makes him unique or 
quite just another warrior.

other scars cover his features further distorting and disfiguring his 
face. A big, untamed bead has been decorated with several long 
braids that hang down as low as this mans chest which, along 
with his long limbs has a defined lean appearance.

#3Background-#0
A veteran soldier of the Dervish, Basil originated from humble 
farmer origins. Raising scimitar in defense of his people Basil has 
served in the dervish for some time now, a military veteran he 
managed to lose in eye in one harsh battle where he was holding 
the tide of enemies before reinforcements can arrive. Respected 
by his officers and fellow soldiers he has proven himself a 
martial asset in the field again and again.

muscled neck leads to a thin, sharp featured face. Angled raven-
black eyebrows adorn a sit of stunning hazel-hued eyes. Long

weather conditions and sparse resourced regions. Outcast from 
his tribe for the rape of the Chief's first born daughter, which is 
fact was consensual on her part. He traveled north to the cities, 
finding employ as a mercenary before the shame of the business 
caused him to continue on his trek north to serve in the 
Silvermoon dervish.

Silvermoon Private - Ghazi~
Name- Ghazi
Rank-Private
#5a beefy, square-jawed man with dark stubble #0

#6Description-#0
A beer gut stands out from afar when one sets their gaze upon
this man. With blocky features and creamy black skin a thick 
slab of meat covers every inch of his form. Although overall hairy 
he seems to have kept his face trimmed to just stubble rather then 
the full-face beard that seems to threaten to sprout at any 
moment. Bushy eyebrows meet in the middle of his mans nose, 
creating one big one.

#3Background-#0
Ghazi grew up as a son of a caravan guard, taught to follow his 
parent in the way of combat he grew in skill with his blade 
quickly and was soon in the employ of his father's sheikh as a 
mercenary. Praised for his skill and good work he grew rich over 
the years. Leaving the business he began to invest his coin, 
unfortunately in risky and often shady deals. After seriously 
pissing off some people that you just shouldn't anger he fled 
Jah'Anshah for the north and ended up using his skills there to 
plow a new life, this time in the military as a soldier rather then 
mercenary.

#5a dusky-skinned, fork-bearded man #0

#6Description-#0
A well kept beard, oddly forked two allow to competing lengths 
of fair to fall to this mans chest. Thin angled eyebrows and a 
sleek nose contrast oddly with his square jaw and rugged 
appearance thanks to the strange beard. A barrel-chest and 
thick, beefy arms suggest that some strength is hidden behind the 
rugged and strange exterior this man's makeup creates.

#3Background-#0
Son of one of the whores in a sheikh's harem Hamdan was 
raised fittingly as that birth station required. He was always built 
for physical work; obviously basic labor was beyond his blood 
and birth so it was the martial life for this boy. Afforded various 
trainers and instructors by his father he learnt well and fast. At a 
young age his father organized his recruitment into a dervish unit 
for him to cut his own way to a station of wealth and power.

#6Description-#0
This mans shiny, black hair has been tightly wound up into a top 
knot, giving him an odd and exotic look. A easy grin can often be 
found on his carefree featured face. A scar runs across his right 
socket, evidently what remains of the strike that took his eye. His 
body is worn and battle-scared, hinting at long years of hardship 
at the hands of others. His movements are confident and proud.

#3Background-#0
Cast out from his family for what he felt was being born in the 
first place, Yafeu has always been a bit of a rebel when it comes 
to life. Stealing, distorting, scamming, and breaking laws and 
rules not to mention claiming numerous girls' virginity. Without 
the hefty allowance his sheikh father had bestowed him to live off 
Yafeu struggled to fill his stomach daily. Casting aside his less 
appealing ways he ended up working as a bouncer in a few 
drinking establishments and whorehouses until he seeking 
something higher and more rewarding signed up in the military 
were advancement in rank could lead to advancement in the 
station of life.

#6Description-#0
Swarthy skinned like all those who share this mans heritage, his 
however is distorted in an abnormally large displays of scars. 
Adding only to the sense that this man has spent many years on 
the battle-field is the grimness that his facial features compile 
together to create. A short beard, neatly trimmed and kept has a 
few specks of grey in it, depicting this man as a veteran.

#3Background-#0
Orphaned at birth or at least as a baby Idris never knew his 
parents, taken in by a passing soldier he was raised in a military 
barracks, the serving boy who would one day grow to be the 
roughest toughest dervish known to those that met him. Cool and 
thoughtful he lacks anything but the basic warriors' humor. 
Serving the dervish for his life he is fiercely loyal and would die 
for his cause.

A wide, bullish nose sits upon this black-skinned man's face. 
Bordered by small, squinty eyes and bushy brows that seem to 
always be pushed down into an aggressive frown and a wide,

Big beefy muscles rip across this mans chest, shoulders and

at, at least until a group of raiders claimed the caravanners lives. 
Fleeing mentally hurt that he couldn't protect his family and 
friends Layth hated himself on his travels west toward Near 
Harad. Arriving at Umbar he was picked up by Dervish 
recruiters and commissioned into the ranks.

he arrived at the north where the dervish offered him a place as a 
soldier and smith for the armory. After several years of service he 
cast aside his black smithing ways and concentrated on the 
soldiers' way. A true veteran he has seen his share of battles,

Silvermoon Private - Rami~
Name- Rami
Rank- Private
#5a crook-nosed, dusky man #0

#6Description-#0
Dusky skin sits softly against the light muscle of this mans body, 
an chest and arms of average proportions he seems to fit easily 
into the crowd except for his crooked, evidently broken nose 
that leans dramatically off to the left as a reminder of some 
sundering blow dealt it in the past. Friendly is the expression 
offered by this mans features as he looks out at the world with 
clarity from milky brown eyes.


#3Background-#0
Rami was always in his elder brothers shadow. Whatever Rami 
accomplished his brother had done so before him or better. No 
end to his frustration Rami made the ultimate sacrifice for his 
people that his brother, full of self-worth would never do. He 
joined the military to fight for his people. Signing up at the young 
age of 16 he was accepted into the dervish as a recruit. Working 
his way up he grows in prowess and confidence with each 
passing year in service.

Silvermoon Private - Salih~
Name- Salih
Rank-Private
#5a tall and lanky, bald-shorn man #0

#6Description-#0
A gleaming shine reflects off this man's bald head in the 
appropriate lighting conditions. Tall as much he seems to have 
developed a lanky build in exchange for his high vantage point, 
sparse muscle pads his limbs, offering a meager vision of leanness 
that loses sight when one takes into account the length of his 
arms. Narrowed eyes seem to look skeptically out at his 
surroundings while a faint smirk plays on his lips at most intervals.

#3Background-#0
Experienced in life, Salih seems to be one of those people that 
has tried everything, having something to say about anything from 
fighting to lovemaking Salih knows his shit, at least enough to 
hold a conversation with anyone. For this sampler of trades 
soldiering seems to have become the end of the line as he now 
and has for several years serves in the Silvermoon Dervish.

Silvermoon Private - Thabit~
Name- Thabit
Rank-Private
#5a willowy, hatchet-faced man with coppery skin #0


#6Description-#0
This mans frame is willowy, long limbs seem to move with a 
smooth grace well his face is one that stands out in the crowd as 
ugly. Hatched-like features seem to have been placed carelessly 
on his face, which is covered by coppery skin that displays his 
heritage. Standing proud he seems to be looking about him with 
an impassive, calculating feel to his demeanor.


#3Background-#0
K'Amy'Ar in birth Thabit was always independent, as soon as 
he was old enough to fend for himself that's what he did. Never 
shying from work he did what had to be done, rarely relying on 
anyone if he can do it himself he trusts hard, never having had a 
true friend in some aspect he lacks social skills. Even with his 
odd features his demeanor and actions cause him to meld into the 
masses with ease, often unnoticed for his deeds and screw ups. 
Signing up at the dervish was just something to do at the time; 
nothing else seemed remotely appealing and any young Harad 
hungers for battle against the west men.

A Bloody Field~
   The formerly green grass of this field is now a bloody red. 
Rivulets of blood run through, coming from the various bodies 
scattered throughout the area. Men and Orks, their armor still 
on them and their bodies fresh. Trees rise up at various 
intervals, arrows and deep gashes in their trunks. The sky above 
is hot, the sun muted by a dense fog. The sounds of battle rise 
up from everywhere, as individual duelers occasionally lapse into 
sight through the fog.

An Earthen, Damp Tunnel~
   Roots dangle down from the earth above, their thin tendrils 
worming through the oval sides of the tunnel. A small hole above 
seems to be the only way in or out, though it doesn't let in 
light. The ground below is littered with worms and dirt, and 
continues southwards. A skeletal hand, some few bits of flash 
still left on it, reaches down like any other root. A damp 
earthen smell permeates the air, mixed with a stench reminiscent 
of rotting flesh.

An Open-Air, Large Courtyard~
   Hard-packed dirt forms the ground of this courtyard, no 
vegetation visible save for the odd weed against the firm 
grey-stone walls. A path, paved with sand-colored stones, makes 
a neat circle about the center of the courtyard, where a raised 
platform can be seen. In the corner sits a circular stone well, 
pulley system made from slightly warped wood and yellowed, tough 
hemp rope. Cone-like lantern fixtures are spaced evenly around 
the courtyard, tinted glass panes accented by dulled bronze 
frames. Thin slits have been made on both sides of the gate, 
carved into the stone with care.

Night creeps along the walls of this courtyard, the illumination
provided by the lanterns having the double effect of also casting
long shadows over the area. The hard-packed dirt upon the ground
captures the light in its small pebbles, reflecting the flame about
and illuminating the path which circles the platform. In the
corner, the well is dark, no lantern placed there to illuminate it.
Thin slits gaze out into the night on either side of the gatehouse,
a pair of lanterns brightly illuminating both them and the gate itself.

   This platform sits at the center of the circle, its wooden

regular intervals about the circle, three lines of ropes winding 
their way through these and around the platform. In the center 
of the platform, a faded crescent can be discerned.

   Encircling the raised platform in the center of the courtyard,

   One cold stone after the next comprises the walls and floor of 
this room, taking away from any warmth brought in by outside 
sources, and offering only scarce handholds. Shadows and dim 
light, cast by lanterns filtering in from above reveal the fact 
that there are no doors leading out, only cold stone looming in. 
The sole exit is in the form of a hole in the ceiling above, high 
enough to make even a tall man struggle to reach.

   Bunk beds are lined up in twin rows against the walls, two lidded 
crates underneath each one. The light of several lanterns, placed high on 
the walls, illuminates the sparsely furnished room. The room is filled with 
the bustling noise of soldiers arming themselves, jeering at each other and 
laughing at the newest rumor. Those who lay in their beds are undisturbed, 
deep in exhausted slumber. The dark wood floor is unadorned and bare, worn 
and polished by the hundreds of feet which have tread upon it. A staircase 
spirals down in the northwest corner.

The Center of the Encampment~
   A large tent, originally reinforced by wooden staves, 
has been laid to waste by fire here. A remnant remains
and is appearently stamped with a large and intricately 
detailed eye. Fire has consumed everything in the area.
Directly in front of the where the tent entrance must of 
been, a pit has been dug, ringed by large stones. Ashes 
adorn its middle. In all directions burnt tents and old
campfires stretch towards the encircling burnt palisade.

Before the Palisade~
   The palisade is mothing but burnt ash here, surrounding what
appears to be a small pit. It is fairly wide, and seems to have 
been dug deep enough to draw water. The water itself is filthy, 
a muddy color that does not promise any kind of sanity. Beside 
the pit, the burnt remains of a few shovels have been planted 
in the earth. To the west, south and north bunt down tents cover
the ground.

Dirt Path Rising on a White Stone Bluff~
   Several rickety piers have been constructed about a large, 
white rock, easily the height of three men, that lurches from 
nowhere out of the grassy ground and ventures a few dozen feet 
westward in to the cold, blue waters of the Great River. The 
piers, each fashioned of crude wood and looking to have gone 
long since being attended, jut from each side of the rocky 
bluff, though two of them look to be of a much sturdier build 
and construction. One spans to the west and the other northwards 
from the bluff. A dirt trail leads east from here, traveling a 
slight decline as it joins the hard dirt-pacted trail that 
continues eastward towards a walled village.

Inside a Large Military Ship~
   A large, tall masted ship constructed of heavy, seasoned 
timber. The construction of the vessel is quite remarkable, 
solid and well cared for. The vessel has definitely been for the 
task of making war, metal shields hung in strategic locations and 
boarding devices scattered about, ready to be deployed. The crew 
itself mirrors the appearance of the vessel, battle hardened and 
ready for war.

atecho 51374 You see people watching you from before the makeshift dock. The Great Anduin, wide and fast here, offers little shelter. The dock hands cast off the ropes and the sailors onboard pull them in and store them at the bow and the stern. The captain at the helm barks a few orders and the sails rise along the masts of the great ship. Once secured, they fill with the breeze and the ship glides easily away from the small dock.

Spreading to the east of the dock, you see the wooded, rolling terrain of Ithilien. Southwards the white cliffs of the Emyn Arnen rise, causing the mighty Anduin to veer sharply to the west. As the ship approaches the wooden dock, it smoothly slows, coming to a stop just before the wooden structure, the activity aboard her becoming almost hectic, heavy ropes being used to secure the craft to the dock. Finally, the boarding ramp descends, comming to rest with a thud.

vertically and sharpened at the upper end. A heavy gate, wide

along rare bits of the walls.

A Large, Wide Open Chamber Throbbing Uncomfortably~
   The tunnel opens up into a large chamber, with massive stone 
supports placed in numerous, strategic positions, to support the 
wide ceiling. On each side of the stone pillars, torches rest, 
burning with an etheral and sickly green light. In stark 
contrast to the previous tunnel, this room is perfectly 
preserved, with only dust marring its original craftsmanship. 
Along each pillar are careful and intricate designs, purely 
artistic in nature. 
   Covering the walls, floor and ceiling like a spreading vine, 
black throbbing veins cling to the surfaces. There is an 
oppressive, uncomfortable echo of wrongness here, especially at 
the northern end of the chamber where the wall seems to defy 
direct viewing, as if it shifts.

Rath Nissah Along the Wall~
   A dirt street runs in the shadow of the high stone wall, 
unrutted by wagons, though marked with the prints of many boots. 
Between the wall and the dirt of the street has been built an 
obstacle course. A sign has been planted here, with arrows 
pointing north and south.

Rath Fangird Reaches the Keep Walls~
   The street ends at a small, heavy, iron-bound gate, wide 
enough for one man to pass at a time, set into the looming stone 
walls of the keep to the north. Small pebbles have been used to 
spell out street names in the dirt. Rath Erynion runs along the 
wall to the east, marked by the frequent passage of many heavy, 
shod hooves. To the west, Rath Nissah leads past small cabins 
and training equipment. And the street leading south is 
identified as Rath Fangird.

Deep in the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Under the Thick Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color. 
   To the south and the east, a river snakes its way through 
Ithilien.

Fast Flowing Stream~
   Fresh, chill waters flow from the north to the south in this

beneath the blue surface and down into the dark, claustrophobic 
underwaters. Tall, ancient trees grow along both banks.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

An Abandoned Timber Camp Amidst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees~
   In the center of this clearing, several log buildings all in 
various states of disrepair, form some sort of encampment. The 
buildings are arranged in a utilitarian fashion and have seen 
much better times. There are many old, rotting logs scattered 
and roughly stacked, and overgrown with moss and fungi strewn 
about the camp. They are nearly as brown and green as the giants 
who tower over them, hemming them into this break in the woods. 
Although the occasional twig snaps in the distance and the leaves 
rustle with the slightest touch of the wind's fingers, there 
remains a quiet hush that hangs lower than the intertwined 
branches overhead. There may be life nearby, but here, all lies 
still.

Towering Rock Mountain Rising From The Forest~
The tall, ancient trees of the forest are overshadowed here by 
a towering stone mountain that has been violently thrust through 
the forest floor long ago. A large spring issues forth a quiet 
hiss as it leaks from a huge crack in the southern face of the 
mountain, feeding a fast flowing stream that disappears into the 
forest. Waves of steam rise from the warm water, leaving the 
area cloaked in a thick fog which makes it difficult to see more 
than a few feet before oneself. While animals are scarce, a wide 
variety of insects occupy the damp grass and the rocks about the 
stream. The entrance to a large cave mouth can be seen within the
mountain wall.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~

There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the

among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles users of wind

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees in Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color. 
   A river runs to the east and south of here.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing 
arm-to-arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown

   To the south, a stone bridge crosses the river, cleared of 
fortifications and blackened by fire but still sturdy in its 
construction.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

Fast Flowing Stream Fed by a Spring to the North~
   Rushing down from the jutting stone to the north, this stream 
begins to gradually gain strength as the waters of the spring 
come from the craggy rocks and begin to form into a fast-flowing 
river that makes its way south. Surging through the Ithilien 
forest, this river has strength enough to pull away those who are 
not wary while in its shoulder-deep waters.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way. Close to the 
mountains, some sign of a dark hole can be seen amongst the dense 
trees.

The Black Grasping Roots of the Massive Eastern Range~
   The scale of the mountains to the east are disconcerting in 
their vast magnitude. Blackened porous stone, tier stacked upon 
tier, rise like the roots of a mammoth tree, each in themselves 
huge but even they are dwarfed by the steepling steps of ever 
reaching mountains that defy the imagination's ability to 
describe. Filling the horizon from from end to end one cannot 
look at its entirety without craning their necks. Little 
wildlife claims this area as home save a few buzzing insects. 
The land underfoot is a reddish sand interspersed with clumps of 
dried razor grasses.

On the Face of a Stone Cliff~
   A path wide enough for three people to walk comfortably 
abreast spans out here, leading from the sheer rise upward toward 
the base, where the mighty Anduin flows. It levels out about 
halfway down, some dozen feet from the Anduin, where it widens to 
a flat panel of smooth rock and dirt, giving space for several 
people or animals. In the cliff face opens a cavern's mouth, as 
wide as the path and tall enough to let all but the tallest of 
humans stand at full height.

creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light. 
   Lying to the south of here is a river which snakes through the

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees at the edge of Ithilien~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

A large Cave~
   This cavernous area is somewhat shallow, carved out of the 
rock by the Anduin in times passed. It is nearly eight feet high 
in many parts, no stalactites nor stalagmites breaking its smooth 
interior. Indeed, the floors, walls, and ceiling are worn 
smooth, enclosing a space nearly twenty-five feet long and twelve 
feet wide. The only break in the walls is southward, where they 
open toward the cliffside.

Descending Barren Hills Nearing a Stream ~
   Standing here at the mouth of one of the many tributaries of 
the Anduin, this collection of hills watches both over the river 
and the area nearby. Only a few long-rotted stumps are scattered 
over the hills, dry grasses and brush taking over the open 
ground. To the north, the stream churns as it mixes with the 
waters of the Anduin, though more prominently stands an ancient 
fortified bridge that spans the stream nearby to the northeast. 
To the west, the river continues on its course southwards, and 
along that route it cuts through the hills that rise along its 
bank.

Before A Fire-Destroyed Bridgehead~
   To the north fire-ruined rubble crosses the river with a 
beaten path leading up to it. Around the area itself, sparse 
vegetation lies, most of it having been cut back and destroyed to 
provide clear lines of sight from the tower above, several lonely 
tree stumps litter the area as proof. The uprooted greenery has 
been left where it fell and has turned various shades of grey and 
brown, this fills the area with a rotting, damp smell that the 
river fails to wash away. Little wildlife can be seen in the 
area, not even the hoot and craw of birds sound here, all of it 
taken up by the heavy fall of the nearby waters. 
   The southern gatehouse ahead is completely burnt and 
collapsed.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green. 
   To the south and west, there is a river snaking its way

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees in Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color. 
   A deep lake lies to the south of here.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way. 
   To the east and south of here, there is a river cutting 
through the lands of Ithilien.

Along the Edge of the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Amongst the Ancient Woods on the Slowly Sloping Land of Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Wind Blown, Grass Covered Knoll Above a Wide River~
   Overlooking the Anduin to the north and west, this grassy 
knoll stands at the border of hills, river, and forest. 
Knee-high grass ripples in wide swaths, the occasional sapling 
having managed to struggle above the green sea. Further to the 
east, the hills continue their undulating course, the land 
dipping slightly before trees block further view. To the south 
the forest has risen atop the hills, the land there too beginning 
its course downwards. From the high position here atop the 
knoll, a break in the canopy can be seen some distance to the 
south, though what may lie there isn't visible from here.

Wind Blown, Brush Covered Hills Overlooking a Dirt Trail~
   Rare in Ithilien is land that is unmolested by the onslaught 
of the forest, yet near the meeting of a wide stream and the 
Anduin no great stands rise from the loam. Long rotted stumps 
are the only evidence that the forest once held dominion over 
this place, yet now the winds seem to whip through the shallow 
depressions between tall, bald hills. Only brush and brambles 
crown them, making swift movement difficult. A ways to the 
north-east can be seen an ancient fortified bridge crossing a 
wide stream, while to the west some distance the Anduin cuts 
through the rolling terrain. To the east however, the forest has 
begun to retake its hold on the place, though a narrow dirt trail 
etches the land harshly.

A Dirt Trail Between Brush Covered Hills and a Tall Woods~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light. 
   Northwards a fire-destroyed rubbled bridge crosses the river.

   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles users of wind 
or wildlife filter between the trees 
   To the north of here, a steep bank leads into a cold river.

Rolling Barren Hills at the Edge of a Petrified Wood South of a Stream~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still. 
   A river snakes through the fertile Ithilien soil to the north 
of here.

Tree Covered Hills Rising Slowly Along the Bank of a River~
   Young trees have managed to get a foothold along the rolling 
hills near the bank of the Anduin. Sparse brush still pervades 
the rises and dips between and atop the land, briars catching 
upon loose clothing of any who make their way through here. 
Sunlight pierces through the sparse canopy, and through the 
slender trunks the surrounding land can be seen. To the south 
the land dips, the hills evening out as young trees have grown 
into a healthy wood. To the east, the terrain continues where 
yet more thin-branched trees have managed to make a holding.

Low Hills Topped by Trees Overlooking a Dirt Trail~
   Low hills rise slowly through this area, young trees having 
taken advantage of the low-lying brambles and thorns to push up 
into the light. As the hills continue north, the trees seems to 
grow sparse, a collection of great stumps all that remains of 
what was once perhaps a tall forest. On closer inspection, one 
might find their wood to have been twisted and burnt. Scattered 
throughout the place are great, stump-shaped stones, bearing a 
striking resemblance to the trunks nearby. To the south the land 
dips, the trees becoming denser around a thin dirt trail that 
winds its way up along the eastern side of a tall hill.

A Dirt Trail Between an Ancient Forest and Brush Covered Hills~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Rolling Hills With a Few Scattered Petrified Trees~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Rolling Hills With a Sparse Grove of Petrified Trees~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Thick Underbrush About the Base of a Huge Boulder Near the Bank of a Stream~
   Thorns and underbrush grow thick along the bank of a fast 
flowing stream here at a narrow gap in the great trees. To the 
northwest, a huge stone pprotruds from the ground, thick thorny 
bushes growing in abundance at its base. Leaning in from the 
south, the moss-hung limbs of squat old trees encase the sky 
above, reducing it to a few fractured angles above and preventing 
all but the strongest of winds from reaching this place. 
   
   At one point, the thorny brush appears a bit thiner, a dark 
gap behind them. 
   To the north and west is cut off by the river.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees South of a Stream~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way. 
   The forest ceases at the river to the north.

Dirt Trail Running Along a Ridge~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light. 
   A river cuts through the lands of Ithilien to the north and 
east.

A Narrow Stream Flowing Through A Grove of Olive Trees~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees. 
   The river runs to the west of this area of the forest.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees at the edge of Ithilien~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

Along the Edge of the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Amongst the Ancient Woods on the Slowly Sloping Land of Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Fast Flowing Stream ~
   Fresh, chill waters flow from the north to the south in this 
river, the current strong enough to pull those overly encumbered 
beneath the blue surface and down into the dark, claustrophobic 
underwaters. Tall, ancient trees grow along both banks.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way. 
   To the south of here, a river steadily runs along its course.

Under the Thick Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still. 
   To the east of here, a river cuts through Ithilien Forest.

Fast Flowing Stream ~
   Fresh, chill waters flow from the north to the south in this 
river, the current strong enough to pull those overly encumbered 
beneath the blue surface and down into the dark, claustrophobic 
underwaters. Tall, ancient trees grow along both banks.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles users of wind 
or wildlife filter between the trees 
   To the west of the forest, a river cuts through the lands of 
Ithilien.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees in Ithilien~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday. 
   A river cuts its course through the fields to the east of 
here.

arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees in Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Rising Dirt Trail Between an Ancient Forest and a Wide River~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Sloping Floor of a Forest With a Narrow Stream ~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green. 
   To the north, a river runs through the Ithilien Forest.

Amongst the Tall Ancient Trees on the Slightly Sloping Land of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Deep in the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Under the Thick Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

A Ridge Above a Tree Filled Hollow at the Edge of Ithilen~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

   Striped brown and black rodents dart away, their movement 
captured only by the corner of one's eye. With tangled branches, 
denuded of their bushy blooms and fiery fall foliage in the 
winter, the brush that grows under the eaves of the heavy forest 
growth here add texture and confusion at ground level which 
stands in sharp contrast to the trail that passes through.

   A tall, ancient forest has long since been taken over by a 
swamp, a lowland submerged in the backwater of the wide river 
that flows just to the west. The reamins of once tall, proud 
trees now leafless, blackened and dead. The water of the swamp 
is quite still, occasional ripples betraying the presence of

   A narrow, dirt trail winds its way between a tall, ancient 
wood and backwater swamp. The trail at times, squeezed by two 
opposing forces, the stalwart water and the constant patience of 
the trees. Stunted, dead trees stand, their roots submerged in 
the still dark water of the mire west of the trail. To the east, 
tall hearty trees stand patiently resisting the encroaching

tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

A Thinning Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien on the Bank of a River~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien on the Bank of a Swift Flowing Tributary~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Under a Thick Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien South of some Hills~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or

Under a Thick Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Ridge Above a Tree Filled Hollow at the Edge of Ithilen~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Ridge Above a Tree Filled Hollow in Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

In a Tree Covered Hollow Between the Undulating Terrain in Ithilien~
   The ground here depresses a bit, a natural wall of rocks 
pressed against the wall of earth in some spots with the old 
trees dangling over the pseudo-trench that runs north and south. 
A trained eye moving down the length of the wall of earth and 
stone might spot a concealed fox's den. Birds sing in the 
network of branches and twigs above that manage to block much of 
the sun.

Between a Thinning Canopy of Ancient Trees~
   The trail goes straight north and south for this stretch, the 
dense canopy of trees giving shade to travellers in occasion; the 
sunlight does break through in some places. Off to the sides 
where the forest is thickest, a carpet of dead leaves and needles 
soften the groud - but the trail is beaten down and footsteps 
evident from days long past. An occasional vine falls into the 
way of the trail, but are their thickest off to the trail's 
sides. During the day, the birds chirp and at night the crickets 
play their symphony. It always smells of pungent earth.

A Tree-Covered Hillside~
   On the way up this hill, the tree line continues farther than 
its neighboring ascensions of earth. Many hills are nearby, 
continuing north and south, while going down the hill would lead 
into the thick forest. During the peak seasons, the entire area 
would be a vibrant green in contrast with an azure sky on a clear 
day. The wind would blow crisp with a rich, forest scent.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees in Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

An Open Trail in Pocket of Hills~
   The trail here winds west and south, leaving the protection of 
the dense forest and winding up in a pocket between hills. To 
the north, the elevation increases and the trees become sparse. 
There is no definite trail, but if one went up the hill they 
would be greeted by a steep hike up rich earth, craggy rocks, and 
fallen trees. The area here is open to the elements and pebbles 
that have fallen off the hills have imprints of feet that show a 
traveler they are still on the trail.

Thick Underbrush and Briar Patches at the Edge of the Woods~
   Irregular tracts of short tenacious grass, tangled with twigs 
and downed branches, rise haphazardly across the terrain here. 
Muggy air envelopes this stretch of the woodland, tinged with the 
odour of rotten wood and soil. Dense, black-green moss pads the 
forest floor in rough patches and blots the faces of the 
encircling evergreens at random. The broad, twisted limbs of 
Ithilien's ancient evergreens sag overhead, bristling with spiky 
growth and laden with pinecones. 
   
   A low ridge of rounded hills rise through the eastern terrain, 
flanked by thick patches of thorny briars, one dominating the

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees at the edge of Ithilien~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

A Trail Between a Forest and Rock Face~
   The trail continues through the forest north and south, barred 
from the east by an impassible cliff of cragged rocks. They look 
rather treacherous, as if the wrong step on them might cause a 
disastrous rock slide. To the west, however, the land is just 
packed in with dense forest. The trail opens up and is shadowed 
only a little by the canopy of the trees. On the trail, high 
winds might cause sand to whip into an unassuming traveler's 
eyes.

Amongst the Ancient Woods on the Slowly Sloping Land of Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Amongst the Tall Ancient Trees on the Slightly Sloping Land of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

its sultry fingers. The grey and brown tree-trunks are covered 
in the green hue. These fighting forces of nature have grown 
over the trail here, which heads north and south, making it 
disappear a few times before coming back into sight. Many 
insects crawl on the forest floor here, and the birds squawk up 
in the canopy awaiting their next meal.

   The deciduous trees give way to an army of evergreens, rising

branches push forth, burshing arm to arm with each other. From 
the foxy-brown carpet of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings 
push up, looking like tiny under-formed branches rising from the

other odors, reinforced by the wind that blows onto this 
hillside. The hills continue southward and going down the hill 
would lead into the Ithilien forest.

Small Clearing With a Back Water Pond Along a Wide River ~
   A small clearing on the bank of a wide river with a deep, dark 
pool of still, stagnate water sets at the edge of a narrow dirt

trees that refuse to die off around the pond. The surface of the 
pond mirror-like dispite the strength of the wind. The ground 
around the pond is littered with dead leaves, that do not crunch, 
but instead suffer a gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks 
hungrily at footwear and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or 
fabric.

Dirt Trail Passing the Edge a Stagnant Pond~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees at the edge of Ithilien~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

Along the Edge of the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Deep in the Ancient Forest on the Rolling Hills of Ithilien~
   The dark earth, revealed in sporadic patches between the 
towering trees, intimate a richness and potential for growth that 
stretches the imagination. Trees, broad based, strong limbed and 
stretching high overhead dapple the light that finally reaches 
the forest floor. The perpetual shadow cast by the trees would 
appear to mix with the earthly smell of decomposing mulch that 
blankets the ground, giving a sense of three dimensionality to 
the atmosphere. The combined smells, diffusion of light and the 
far reaching natural quiet bespeaks a timeless cycle of life that 
defines the area. Travel through this area afoot is nigh 
effortless as the dense canopy gives way to grey stone mountains 
bordered by a fast moving river to the east. A clear means of 
skirting the mountains and traveling along the bank to the east 
is not readily apparent.

Within a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees~
   There is a marked change in the forest's vegetation here. A 
large wide clearing appears overgrown with smaller and less 
imposing underbrush. Where game trails wind their way through 
the forest floor blackened ground can be discerned. The trees at 
the edge of the clearing bear blackened trunks to the height of a 
man as testament to some past catastrophe. Near to the center of 
the clearing can be seen a tumble down stone structure's walls. 
The stones are fire blackened and their facade appears in the 
process of being reclaimed by the forest.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees on a Trail~
   The trees lose their density here, more sunlight reaching the 
forest floor. The path runs along at the foot of hills to the 
east, the path itself running north and turning west. Southward, 
the hills continue as well. A few large rocks and boulders offer 
places for travellers to pass by, and the occasional root sticks 
out of the ground trip the clumsy ones.

   Much like the hill to the south, this one has crisp green 
grass over its earth, giving it a vibrant color during the spring

and south, and a trail winding through the ancient forest can be 
seen down the hill. The occasional bird of prey can be seen 
flying about the canopy of the forest and the wind, when blowing, 
is fresh and cool atop this hill.

stone. Below to the west , the mighty River Anduin flows 
endlessly southwards. Tall, ancient trees grow below to the 
east.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

Under the Thick Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

A Trail Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is heavy here; but 
sure enough, the damp has encourage a vast carpet of green moss 
to grow over the fallen trees, grey boulders, and thick network 
of roots. A bush occasionally bursts with life, a squirrelly 
couple rushing out and then rushing up a tree trunk with haste. 
The moss is starting to grow over the beaten, earthen trail that 
winds north and south through the deep forest.

Atop One of Many Rolling Hills~
   The trees begin to disperse and the bushes increase in their 
numbers, showing that they have dominance here. The grass on the 
ground is a vibrant, lush green during the spring and summer. 
During fall it dies naturally, and during the winter the hill 
would be hard to ascend with the slippery snow. The entire area 
is in the open, exposed to the the elements. Some crickets can 
be heard in the knee-high grass and on a windy day, one could get 
a brisk breeze atop here. Northward, the hill slops down to a 
trail. Downward, a steep slope, leads to the same trail that has 
wound around the hill. East and south reveal more rolling 
hillsides.

A Grassy Hillside~
   The hills continue down and up here, the grass green and soft 
- a perfect place to lay upon on a warm, clear day with a crisp 
wind. If one was a traveler, however, these hills would be 
nothing but a frustrating hike consisting of a repeated hike up 
and down, rinse and repeat. There are the occasional bushes that 
rustle in the wind. A herd of deer may graze in the distance, 
and predatory birds call overhead as they search for prey. The 
hills continue, rising up to the north and west.

Old,Thick Trees Along the Bank of the Great River~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green. The 
wood ends abruptly to thew west, as the land falls away into the 
River. Steep hills rise to the north.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees at the edge of Ithilien~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

Along the Edge of the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees at the edge of Ithilien~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

Along the Edge of the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

Along the Edge of the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Amongst the Ancient Woods on the Slowly Sloping Land of Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Deep in the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Under the Thick Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day

might tree the clumsiest of passers-by. The hardiest of plants 
and vines twine around the giant sentinels that rise everything 
in a desperate bid for life and light. This rich concentration 
of natural life works to blind travellers from the trail that 
goes north and south, disconnecting the beaten earth a few times 
only to let it reappear a few meters down.

Atop One of a Line of Hills~
   Like a ridgeline of small mountains, these hills do not seem 
to cease to the north and south. Leagues of grassy hills roll 
down and up, some dotted with rich evergreens, bushes, and 
boulders. In the distance, far out of any weapon's reach, a herd 
of deer can be seen grazing on the vegetation and high in the 
skies, birds of prey circle around and search for their next 
meal. The wind blows unrestrained atop these hills, and on an 
especially rough day, strong gusts might topple a clumsy or 
weighed-down traveller.

Grassy Field Meeting a Thick Wood Along a Wide River~
   From south to north this section of North Ithilien rolls in a 
gently sloped plain, the flat fields lying between the Great 
river Anduin and a tall, ancient forest. The field is covered 
with thick grasses that range from two to four feet in height, 
the land having a wild, unconquered look to it, though the local 
wildlife have worn narrow tracks which allow passage through the 
more thickly vegetated areas. Patches of light brown earth can 
be seen from time to time.

   The base of an ancient tower can barely be discerned from the 
dense verdant growth of this place. Standing at its tallest a 
few feet above the ground its black stone ellipse of an outer 
wall might provide some small measure of defense still.

Jagged Ridge Running East of a Rocky Mountain~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Trail Through the Ithilien~
   The brown, earthen trail moves north and south here, the 
footprints of travellers long ago present to lead the way for 
current wanderers. The trail goes under a thick canopy of trees 
in the dense Ithilien forest which are alive with life during the 
peak seasons of Spring and Summer. Birds sing in unison, other 
critters chatter away to assist, and the wind blows the leaves 
and bushes to give it a little bass. During the Fall, the orange 
and brown forest is still alive with sounds until it finally 
falls silent during the chilly Winter; but wildlife can always be 
seen here.

   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.
