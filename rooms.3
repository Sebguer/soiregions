Storage Room, The Leaking Barrel Tavern~
   This back room of the tavern is used strictly for storing 
gallons and gallons of drinks, as well as a few non-perishable 
food items. Dusty walls and a dirt-splotched floor make up this 
rather cramped room, surrounded on the east and west by stacks of 
barrels. The thick odor of alcohol permeates this place. 
   A tall door of mahogany stands to the south, heavily 
contrasting the filth of the rest of the tavern. There is a 
small rectangular hole near the top of the door, though it looks 
to be covered by a panel on the other side.

The Second Floor of the Warehouse~
   The same dark ash used to create the first floor is used here 
as well. However, many of the giant support beams have fallen 
down, especially in the center of this room, and the ceiling has 
collapsed upon it. Luckily, the debris did not crash through 
onto the first floor. There are only a few scattered crates and 
barrels stacked here, most hugging the outside wall and avoiding 
the pile of rubble in the interior. Looking out the hole the 
collapsed roof has provided, one can see the green side of the 
massive Mount Mindolluin and beside it, the great wall of the 
third circle. 
   A thin staircase leads back down to the first floor from the 
northernmost section of this room, and in the south wall two 
holes where shutters may of once been look down to the street 
below.

Kitchen Behind the Tavern~
   This large room is surprisingly cramped, having been crammed
with almost every sort of supply and foodstuff imaginable. The
aged hardwood floor, stained here and there over the years, is
dominated by a large number of tables and counters; set into the
northern wall, the rear of the common room's hearth has been
exposed, allowing its use in the preparation of food. Despite
the crowded nature of this area, however, it has been cleaned and
arranged immaculately, hinting at the pride its owner takes in
the tidy appearance of this kitchen.
   An archway to the west leads to what appears to be a small
distillery, and doors are set into the eastern and northern walls.
A small trapdoor has been set into the floor, leading down.

A Small Distillery~
   A smaller chamber set off to the side of the main kitchen, 
this room appears dedicated to the art and science of brewing. 
Various barrels and kegs of supplies have been stacked neatly to 
one side; all sorts of brewing and distillation apparatuses have 
been set up throughout, gleaming cleanly in the area's ample 
light. An aged oaken archway leads out to the east, and a stout 
door is set in the northern wall.

A Small, Cozy Bedchamber~
   A comfortably small room set off the main kitchen, this 
bedchamber is somewhat tiny but nonetheless well-appointed. A 
thick, soft green carpeting covers the cold wooden floor, and the 
walls are hung with faded but elegant tapestries to help trap the 
heat. A large bed has been set up against the eastern wall, and 
a writing desk stands against the northern one. A reinforced 
oaken door leads out to the west, and a small ladder leads up to 
the loft.

In a Long, Well-Lit Hallway~
   Carpet covers the floor, the dark color seeming as though it's 
been recently placed due to its vividness and cleanliness. Lamps 
have been placed this way and that, brightly lighting the hallway 
as it continues towards the north, and illuminating the stairs 
that lead down into the common area. Three doors flank this area 
of the hall. Renters can #6enter#0 their room, either #6one#0, 
#6two#0, or #6three#0 via the western, southern or eastern doors 
respectively.

on. The room is used by the scribes of this building for doing 
their work in a quiet space. There are no shelves on the walls 
and the only light is provided by a few wall-scones with candles 
resting in them.

Rynd Thannath, Roof-Top Garden~
   Rynd Thannath's halls lie to the south and in the building 
below, here however is a roof-top garden built by the scribes for 
a place to rest and relax. Small trees and potted plants sit 
around the edges of the cobblestone floor. A low walls about 
waist high on the average person sits around the very edge of the 
roof. A couple of benches sit to the east and west side of the 
roof, behind which sit the walls of the building next door. To 
the north can be seen Rath Thoron, a door also leaves to the 
south into the building.

Rynd Thannath, Apprentice Dormitory~
   This attic is the home of the Apprentice Dormitory of the Halls 
of Learning. Though slightly drafty toward the edges, the room 
is large enough and warm enough to house quite a few people. The 
roof is slightly low, but this doesn't particularly impede 
travel. The floor is of unpolished darkwood. The room is lit by 
candles mostly though a lantern or two is hung from hooks in the 
walls.

A Dry, Abandoned Field Before a Building~
   Across the lawn a large building made of dark stone can be 
seen resting in the distnace. A large, tattered banner has been 
hung above the entrance to the building, the edges frayed and a 
few holes upon its finely sewn surface. The banner is that of a 
black backing with the insignia of a crimson wolf's head 
carefully etched into its surface. Next to it is a flag, 
Gondor's White Tree prominent, if a bit dirty. The lawn seems to 
have withered away, leaving this a dry field of dirt. A crude 
circle can be made out, carved into the ground, in the field. 
Long torches are placed throughout the area, though they seem to 
have long outlasted their usefulness. An abandoned feel lingers 
to this place, the rusted gate leading south stained with a 
darker brown, and the building to the north bearing several 
shattered windows, though the door seems a stout guardian still.

A Sparring Ring~
   This circular constructions of stones on the dirt has been 
formed into a crude sparring ring for weapons practice. Some of 
the rocks have been spattered by blood from past fights. No more 
then 12 feet across any way it makes for a cramped, close quarter 
combat area. A few smatterings of dry, withered brown grass ring 
the circle.

An Airy, Deserted Room~
   A small stub of wood potrudes from what is left of the northern 
wall, the rest of whatever it was seemingly destroyed to tell by 
the jagged, splintered ending. The wall continues past the stub 
for a short distance, slate gray stones blackened with soot, 
before reaching a gaping hole. Shards of jagged metal seem to 
have been embedded into the mortar of the wall, the base of what 
was once a stove still firmly attached to the ground. The hole 
beyond shows only timber-strewn rubble, stained a deep, dark 
brown on nearly the entirety of the ruin.

in the corner of the room, cold grey ashes proving the disuse of 
the place, above empty, dusty shelves and cabinets. A small vent 
at the top of the low roof allows air to enter, a view on the sky 
visible from here. The floor of this room is made of scarred 
wooden planks, thick and grimy. A single tattered curtain 
provides some modicum of privacy from the east.

A Slope Roofed Barracks~
   Above the loud snores and natural scents of those men and 
women who are asleep, the occasional person can be seen cleaning 
their armors or polishing their weapons. At all hours there 
appear to be guards posted at the doorway, only allowing those 
who are of the company to enter the room. A few hanging lanterns 
have been placed at all corners of the room to provide light 
throughout the day. The room itself seems to be made up of slate 
gray stone which make up the sturdy walls and floor and the 
ceiling being made up of darkened wooden planks.

A Low, Empty Roof~
   This roof, barely accessible through a small vent, is barren 
and empty, hidden from the east by the slope of a taller roof. A 
pile of timbers and stones have been placed here, facing the dry, 
arid courtyard. It does not seem high at all, about waist 
height. To the north, rubbled ruins lie, jagged timbers shooting 
up like spears waiting to impale. To the east, the roof slopes 
steeply, ending in a single peak. On the southwest corner, it 
seems as if something had carved into the stone of the roof, 
making two small, wide indents.

   This courtyard, though not large, is more than adequate to
allow carts to pass through as they deliver things to the
Fellowship Halls. The road is cobbled, but the stones are not
very well aligned, allowing patches of dirt to show between the
stones. The walls to the east and south, beside the gates, are
high and made of white stone, as are the buildings to the north
and west. The road lies to the south, while a workshop is 
visible to the north.

wood that has been fitted over the existing stone walls. Doors 
lead north and south while to the east the hall continues.

A Large Forge~
   This large forge is where the ringing sounds of the hall come 
from. The floors are made of cobblestones that in places have a 
metallic sheen where molten hot steel has been dropped when being 
melted. Benches and fire-pots sit all about the room, and the 
walls are all made of stone, to prevent fire from spreading in 
the case of an accident. Two large doors swing open to the west 
out into a cobbled courtyard.

The Dining Room~
   This is the feast hall of the Armorers Fellowship. Here it is 
that meals are taken when the armorers have time. The sounds of 
the forge can still be heard even here at most times during the 
day and sometimes late into the night. A door leads to the south 
out into the hallway, while to the west lies the kitchen.

   This storage room is well-built using cobblestones for the 
floor and white stones for the walls. The ceiling is made of 
wood and candle holders sit around the walls giving light where 
needed. Shelves, chests and wardrobes sit about this room 
providing places to put finished armour. The room is also free

the House of Ringing Sounds. The floors of the kitchen are made 
of cobblestones much like the rest of this level of the building. 
Benches for food preparation sit along the walls and cupboards 
sit beside them. A fireplace sits at the northern end of the 
room and to the southeast of the room a staircase leads up to the 
second floor.

two men to walk side by side as it leads from a spacious entry
foyer and sitting room to the north and into this section. The
walls have been freshly painted a deep brown color that is a
shade lighter than that of the carpeting underfoot. Three doors
flank this section of the hall, nondescript and set into the
southern, western and eastern walls.

On an Arch Overlooking Rath Daelond~
   Constructed from the same white stone as the colossal city 
walls of Minas Tirith, this arch connects the buildings to the 
north and the south. A recently-cleaned, waist-high row of 
stones acts as guard to protect careless people from falling onto 
the street of Rath Daelond below, and two lanterns--one on either 
side of the arch--cover the area with light. One can easily look 
east and west out over the street as it winds east to west 
through the second circle of the city, while two stout wooden 
doors block entrance to the northern and southern buildings.

Spacious Foyer~
   This spacious foyer is richly decorated. Rich brown wooden 
panels, engraved with detailed depictions of multitudinous scenes 
of various exotic locations, cover the walls. A lone tapestry 
depicting an old man with a pointy white beard is hung over the 
panels near the base of the stairway in the northwestern corner 
of the room. Two exquisitely shaped columns support the vaulted 
ceiling, from where a glass chandelier, hanging from a 
gold-plated chain, keeps the windowless room perpetually alit. 
The floor is mostly covered by a spacious carpet, sporting 
various multicolored interlocking patterns a marble slate has 
been installed directly next to the doors leading outside, to the 
south and west, allowing visitors to remove their shoes without 
staining the delicate carpet. A wide stairway, curves in a 
counter-clockwise manner against the western wall, while two 
passageways open up to the north and east.

stairway~
The base of the stairway enters the room from the west, but the stairs 
rapidly curve in a counter-clockwise manner, closely hugging the 
western wall, until they finish their half-circle, disappearing into the 
upper floor of the building.  The stairs are of dark-brown stained 
hardwood and are slightly worn down in the middle of each step through 
years of use.  The railings are of the same composition as the stairs; 
they are finely polished and are smooth to the touch.
~
E
walls~
The walls are covered by multiple depictions of various landscapes.  
Some of the locations are native to Minas Tirith, with several panels 
showing the glorious white tower from different locations within the 
city.  Others depict small villages, forests, mountains, and several 
others unremarkable cities.  One of the panels, mostly hidden by the 
unmovable tapestry, reveals some sort of ugly-looking fortress located 
on the slope of a mountain, surrounded by rain-clouds and lightning.  
~
E
carpet~
Large and spacious, this carpet appears to have been specifically 
custom made for this particular room, as it fits perfectly against 
the three walls and the marble slate near the doorway to the south.  
The pattern appears to be random, but systematic, with multiple 
lines of indigo blue, scarlet red, saffron orange, pale sapphire blue, 
and malachite green intertwining and spiraling along the entire 
edge of the carpet.  Peeking under the corner of the carpet reveals 
a polished hardwood floor, as well as hefty amounts of dust.
~

tapestry '~
     Though having somewhat faded with time, this tapestry still 
shines with the radiance of the fine, exotic dyes used by its weavers.  
The entire tapestry is composed of an enormous depiction of the bust 
of an old man.  The frown on his face is further enhanced by the
oddly trimmed moustache that covers up the entire upper lip.  This, 
along with the pointy white beard, the somewhat erratic hair, and the
glaring eyes that have been represented by shiny blue glass beads, 
makes the old man appear to be scowling and glaring at anyone 
walking directly beneath the tapestry.

   This short and narrow corridor connects the spacious foyer to

and ceiling are composed of simple dark-brown stained oaken 
wooden panels. The floor is of a similar type of wood, but its 
surface has worn down through constant use, appearing to be 
somewhat yellowish. A faint light enters the hallway from the 
room to the south, granting just enough light so as not to trip 
over one's own feet.

Opulent Bedroom~
   This opulent bedroom bears the faint scent of perfume. The 
linens and draperies bear floral motifs and are of soft, muted 
colours. Finely woven tapestries cover the walls, bearing images 
of forest animals and landscapes. A soft, earth-brown rug 
blankets the polished hardwood floorboards. Heavy draperies 
cover two large windows, effectively keeping out any light when 
drawn. Elegant furnishings have been thoughtfully arranged about 
the room.

End of a Wide Corridor~
   The hallway ends at a paneled wall, with a lone door that 
leads into the servants' quarters. The wall curves around, 
forming small rounded enclaves where there would usually be 
corners. There are two large ceramic vases in the enclaves; they 
serve as holding pots for exotic cactus-like plants. A large 
decorative tapestry with the image of an enormous blue and yellow 
flower serves as the carpet for the entire hallway.

Luxurious Bedroom~
   This luxurious bedroom mildly contrasts with the rest of the 
house. Unlike the hardwood paneled walls and rigid furniture 
outside, this room has been decorated with an attempt to create 
an aura of comfort. The walls are covered in an elegant pattern 
of landscape tapestries that perfectly fit together. The 
tapestries depict various nature scenes, creating the effect of 
actually being in a country gazebo rather than in a country 
house. The floor is covered in a soft dark-green carpet.

A Large Room, Before a Grand Stairway ~
   Alternating black and grey marble tiles swirl into a central 
pattern here, meeting at the base of a small, statued fountain in 
the room's centre, also fashioned of marble. The lofty ceiling 
here lifts high above, the northern front set with panes of glass 
that send shafts of dazzling light into the enclosure during the 
daytime, whilst silver-sconced lamps proffer illumination at 
night. The room is mostly devoid of furniture, as it quickly 
ends to the south were the roots of a grand, double-stairway 
curve upward to meet at a hidden landing, carpeted in sky blue 
velvet and wrought with an etched iron railing. An open walkway 
to the north leads out into the front foyer of the manor, while a 
gap in the western and eastern walls lead into the dining room 
and kitchens, respectively.

square landing here, padded with velvet dyed a soft, sky blue. 
The polished iron railings at either end are capped with 
curve-winged falcons, intricately carved. The floor of the 
landing itself is one of creamy marble, fine in quality and 
deeply reflective. A pair of fine mahogany doors mark an exit to 
the south, set with a pair of silver-chased handles and elaborate 
knockers. The landing also branches off into two hallways to the 
west and east.

between the doors, each depicting resplendant Gondorian armies on 
black fields, and a variety of ancient Tengwar sigils. Small,

encircling the room's entirety. A few pieces of furniture ring 
the center of the floor, well-attended and seemingly very 
comfortable in their craftsmanship.

A Large, Well-Appointed Room~
   While the rest of the manor is formed mainly of stone, in 
contrast, this room is constructed primarily of wood, giving it a 
sense of warmth and comfort. Smooth planed boards are fitted 
together expertly to form the floor, and treated with an even 
coat of varnish until they glisten softly under sun or lamplight. 
Lamps in brass holders are placed strategically about the room, 
to banish darkness under night, and for day-time lighting a large 
bay window is set in the eastern wall of the room. This window 
allows a glorious view of the sunrise and over the city of Minas 
Tirith in general, looking down towards the second wall. A 
fireplace is set within the western wall, with an elegant mantle 
carved with scroll work. The ceilings are lofty with arching 
beam supports, carved with the same scroll work that is present 
upon the mantle, though in a larger scale.

Second Level of a Derelict Warehouse~
   Movement through the second floor of this long abandoned 
warehouse brings a variety of groaning and squeaking noises. The 
roof no longer rests overhead, rather, the eastern half has 
collapsed in a pile of rotted wood and plaster while the western 
section of the roof is simple gone, as is most of the west wall 
that overlooks the street of Rath Daelond below. Holes litter 
the floor, and a thick layer of dust and cobwebs cover nearly 
every surface. A hazardous staircase leads back down to the 
first, and more stable floor, of the warehouse.

wood, painted black in colour, and sits high overhead. Tall
wooden doors line the north and south wall, a tiny barred window

the cells each bear a burning lamp, leading down the corridor to

its frame to reinforce it. Many racks and shelves run around the

floor here. The white stone walls are close set, giving this 
room a confined feeling. To the west the duty room can be seen.

through shutters, two in each the western and southern walls,

of the hallway. A lantern affixed to the wall by a rusty iron 
bracket illuminates the area dimly, and the smells of oil mingles 
with the faint aroma of poor quality incense past the door to the 
south. Doors set in the east and north wall, unpainted, lead off 
while a slightly large oak door rests in the west wall. A narrow 
staircase leads up at the end of the hallway.

timber have been removed and their positions strengthened with 
thicker, stouter boards of oak alongside the rest of the pine 
fence. Over the western edge of the fence, a warehouse seems to 
be visible. Sounds of the second circle rise thick around this 
sparring circle, no more complicated than a dusty circle drawn in 
the dirt. Two lampposts are set adjacent the door to the large 
building to the south, lighting this area at all hours of the 
night.

vast expanses of the Pelennor Field meet, their white paving 
stones so worn by the ages and battered by the elements that they 
seem a part of the earth itself. To the west rises up the grand 
city of Minas Tirith, the white walls contrasting strongly 
against the gigantic mass of Mount Mindolluin in which the seat 
of Gondor is set. In all other directions the grassy plains of 
the fields run past the limits of the eyes, dotted farmsteads and 
the three winding roads set throughout them. The occasional 
traveler or armed patrolman make the trek along the roads, 
accompanied by rumbling trade caravans and wagons bearing goods 
to and fro across the landscape of Gondor.

Lond Forodren-Rhunen Turns North and West~
   Tall, iron lamp posts have been placed at regular intervals at 
either side of the road as its broad white cobblestones lay down 
a path through the grass and vegetation of Pelennor Field. 
Passing by on this road are a constant number of travelers and 
merchants, walking to the sides of the Lond Forodren-Rhunen to 
avoid the carts and trade caravans that rumble up and down the 
centre of it. In all directions the green plains of Pelennor 
stretch out, and in the west sit the distance form of Mount 
Mindolluin, its snow capped peaks constantly surrounded in mist. 
   North and west Lond Forodren-Rhunen turns, the white walls of 
the city of Minas Tirith visible in the distance to the west.

North and South on Lond Forodren-Rhunen~
   Lond Forodren-Rhunen recieves a slight flow of traffic no 
matter what hour of day. Well armed guardsmen walk up and down 
its length ensuring that law and order are held in place and no 
brigands threaten the goods and valuables that travel in merchant 
wagons and caravans through the road. Even lowly vagrants and 
travelers looking for work pass by on Lond Forodren-Rhunen, the 
road allowing good time to be made as opposed to trekking across 
the grassy plains of Pelennor Field. 
   The smooth white cobblestones run north and south here through 
the plains, and in the distance to the south-west a grand city 
can be seen carved into the side of Mount Mindolluin.

A Bend South and East in Lond Forodren-Rhunen~
   The road of Lond Forodren-Rhunen leads its way from northwest 
to southeast through the grassy, all-embracing Pelennor Field. 
The off-white paving stones have been worn smooth by the progress 
of time, and the road is wide enough for three carts to travel 
side by side. Beside the road the vegetation is slightly 
trampled by those travelers that do not wish for the hard stones 
of Lond Forodren-Rhunen, yet the plains that expand as far as the 
eye to the north, east and south have more then enough grass to 
make up for this small loss. 
   Bending south and east here the road of Lond Forodren-Rhunen 
continues its trek through the Pelennor Fields.

the ceiling high up and constructed from the same white stone as the 
walls. A number of iron lamps have been attached to the south 
wall by metal brackets, dispelling all shadows in this area. 
Shouts and screams, as well as the occasional slam of a door, 
echo throughout the corridor here. At the eastern end of the 
corridor a spiraling staircase leads down to the basement of the 
cells and up to the second floor. Heavy, oak doors secured with

Dank Cell~
   This cell is damp and dank, unlit save what light comes 
through the door. Taller then most men, and constructed from 
solid oak reinforced with iron bands, a small window crossed with 
iron bars completes the door. Neat stone walls, floor and 
ceiling reside close together, making the small space cramped. 
The occasional shout and slam can be heard, seemingly distant.

A Damp Stone Hallway~
   This dingy stone hallway angles downward to the east, flanked 
on both sides by iron-clad torches mounted to the wall. On the 
western end, five dirty steps turn north and up, stopping at an 
iron-bound door. Water seeps through small cracks in the walls, 
not much, but enough for small beads to gather on the dirty 
stone. Silence shrouds this corridor, broken very seldomly by 
the passing of footsteps. Each stone set in the floor has been 
carefully fitted, linking with the others almost perfectly.

Atop a Stone Stairwell~
   Coming from the west, a long, stone hallway ends here, 
vaulting down into a faintly lit room. Each of the countless 
steps leading into the dimly lit gloom look to be in good shape, 
as no cracks or chips can be seen on their surface's. The same 
dingy stone graces the floor and walls, worn smooth and blackened 
with the passing of years and dirt. Four torches can be easily 
seen, two on each side, at the bottom and top, fighting back ever 
present darkness.

A Dimly-Lit Stone Chamber~
   Branching off to the east, south, and up a damp staircase to 
the west, this cold stone room is kept constantly lit by a few, 
dim torches held in brackets along the walls. The floor has been 
blackened by the passing of many feet, as well as from soot, and 
ever present dirt. Damp to the touch, it radiates nothing but 
cold. The same chill creeps from the walls, cracks worn into the 
once alabaster stone, scars from time past. 
   South, a stone archway opens into a darkened room. A single 
barred wooden door stands into the eastern wall, a single hatch 
at its base, and a faint sound of dripping water drifting from 
the entrance.

A Damp, White Stone Cell~
   Resembling a rectangular crate tipped on its end, this room is 
with no mistake, a cell. Its walls have been created of an 
alabaster stone, worn smooth as they tower up to the ceiling, the 
walls become cleaner the higher they go. With floors of chipped 
and broken stones, the intent of this room is clear, escape is 
impossible, and someone locked in here could be forgotten with 
ease. An ever-present chill hangs in this prison, along with the 
everpresent stench of rotting and death. 
   At the top of the western wall, a hole the size of a man's 
head lets in what fresh air and light the prisoners enjoy. The 
only possible entry and escape to this room stands out; a simple 
wooden door, iron-barred at the top, with a small hatch at the 
bottom. A few words have been etched into the northern wall.

A Stone-Walled Vault~
   Inside this alabaster room, the four walls rise upward to meet 
the ceiling, crossed with large wooden beams running north and 
south. They are spaced out every four feet or so from each 
other, holding up what lies overhead. Underfoot, the once white 
stones have been blackened with time, but are free from cracks 
and splits. Iron torch racks have been cleverly spaced about the 
room, offering light to this room, as it has no windows. 
   The only visible exit to this vault-like room would be to pass 
under the stone archway to the north, opening into a dim light 
like the mouth of some great leviathian.

West Wing, Second Floor of Jail~
   Few people move through the corridor here, save the occasional 
guard with a stamping of feet and jingling of key. Set in the 
southern stone wall is a tall, yet thin, door, the gentle sounds 
of snoring drifting from it. The hallway here is illuminated by 
light produced by the lamps attached to the iron wall brackets 
running along the north wall. 
   The corridor continues east while a staircase at the west end 
leads down.

placed in an age gone by. The wooden floorboards creak 
underfoot, and the faints sounds of men at rest can be heard in a 
muffled form through the southern wall.

brackets between the cells each bear a burning lamp, leading down 
the corridor to the west. The eastern end of the corridor is 
occupied by a narrow, spiraling staircase, and a small door is 
set in the south wall.

   Numerous bunkbeds line the floor of this room, a number of them
filled by a sleeping form. Snores, some gentle others brackish,
sound out through the room here, the area never truly quiet and still.
A single, small lamp burns in the south west corner of the room, casting
a dull light and the smell of lamp oil about the place. A door set in
the north wall leads out of the room, while a curtain has been draped
across to the east.

   While perhaps originally containing a moderate amount of

east and west walls as well as numerous barrels and crates about 
the floor. Half rusted armour, blunt weaponry and moth savaged 
clothes features as the contents for most of the room, but a 
number of quality items can be seen here and there among the 
second hand objects. A door set in the north wall leads out of 
this cramped room.

the stones. The noises of men at sleep echo throughout the room, 
coming from a number of form at rest in the bunkbeds that have 
been arrange on the floor in several neat rows. To the west a 
curtain has been draped over a hole in the wall, solid stone 
laying to the north, east and south.

Lond Duven South of the Great Crossing~
   The ancient road of Lond Duven leads a straight path through 
the stretching Pelennor Field, its cobblestones white slabs set 
together without gaps between them. A few, but constant, number 
of people can be seen walking up and down the wide road, ranging 
from raggedly dressed travelers to the armoured figures of the 
highway patrol. Iron lamp posts set at periodic lengths cast 
down light onto the road when night falls, and when the day is 
high the grassy fields of Pelennor can be seen for miles around. 
   Lond Duven runs south here, to the north three great roads 
meeting together. The white stone walls of Minas Tirith can be 
seen a short distance to the north west.

Lond Forodren-Annui Just North of the Great Crossing~
   The cobbled road of Lond Forodren-Annui treks through the 
grassy Pelennor Fields. Passed over by numerous caravans, 
guardsmen, and even the lowest form of vagrant, the white stones 
run past farmsteads and knee-high grass. The prominent 
easternmost peak of the White Mountains, Mount Mindolluin keeps 
its presence well-known to travellers, always being just a few 
miles from the west side of the road. Wildlife mixes with the 
many people and carts passing over the cobbles, fleeting views 
often caught by anyone looking. The sheer, rocky slopes of Mount 
Mindolluin rise just a few miles of to the west, while the great 
ivory walls of Minas Tirith loom easily visible off to the 
southwest.

East of the Great Crossing on Lond Forodren-Rhunen~
   The road of Lond Forodren-Rhunen leads its way from northeast 
to southwest through the grassy, all-embracing Pelennor Field. 
The off-white paving stones have been worn smooth by the progress 
of time, and the road is wide enough for three carts to travel 
side by side. Beside the road the vegetation is slightly 
trampled by those travelers that do not wish for the hard stones 
of Lond Forodren-Rhunen, yet the plains that expand as far as the 
eye to the north, east and south have more then enough grass to 
make up for this small loss. 
   To the west the road runs into the Great Crossing of the three 
roads of the Field, and it leads on to the east, through the 
plains.

South-east of the Grand City of Minas Tirith~
   From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Pelennor Fields is offered to the eye. The land has been 
divided by the numerous fences and dirt roads criss-crossing 
through it, different crops being grown showing through as 
different colours, as well as green grass of fallow fields and 
yellow of areas in need of rain. The odd tree and hillock occur 
time from time among the Fields, along with farmsteads housing 
those that work upon them to produce all sorts of agricultural 
products. The looming figure of Mount Mindolluin lies in the 
distant to the west, its craggy slopes clearly visible. 
   To the north-west the walls of Minas Tirith bend and curve to 
head west and north, with the grand gates of the city lying to 
the north. To the east and south the stone cobbles of a road 
lies.

In Pelennor Fields, South of the Walls of Minas Tirith~
   Fertile soil gives growth to a multitude of things in the 
Pelennor Fields, to the green grass on the hills and fallows 
fields, to the numerous crops of wheat, barley, beans and other 
such things and to the grazing land for the herds of cattle and 
sheep that occupy the Fields. As they expand outwards in all 
directions, contained only by the Mount Mindolluin to the west 
and the Rammas Echor that forms their boundaries, the Pelennor 
Fields contain within them much of the agricultural production 
for Northern Gondor and the city Minas Tirith. 
   To the north the walls of the mighty city of Minas Tirith 
stand, the capital of Gondor, the rest of the city climbing 
upwards deeper into Mount Mindolluin.

West of the Slopes of Mount Mindolluin and South of the City of Minas Tirith~
   Mount Mindolluin climbs out from the rough ground here to 
staggering proportions high in the sky, the rocky sides and sheer 
slopes presenting it as a symbol of raw elemental powers, untamed 
by the hand of man as are the Pelennor Fields that stretch out 
from it to the east. Snow sits packed onto its upper echelons 
and the mighty peak that lies to the south-west, and mist and low 
clouds curls around the uppermost reaches. North and south the 
slope of the mountain continues, while the Pelennor Fields 
stretch out to the east. 
   The white walls of Minas Tirith lay to the north, the city cut 
into Mount Mindolluin. Southwards a road leads to a gate in the 
Rammas Echor, while passage along the walls of the city continues 
to the east.

Lond Duven Turns to the North and West at the Foot of a Gate~
   Broad, white, flag stones run underfoot here, smoothed down by 
untold years of usage from both man and beast and kept clean by a 
concious effort of the patrolmen who ensure the safety of Lond 
Duven. An excellent view of the countryside of Gondor is offered 
on this stretch of the road, Pelennor Field present in all 
directions. Mostly grass and cultivated late, the occasional 
farmstead or rocky outcrop can be seen. Wagons and caravans 
rumbles along the road, transporting goods all over the 
countryside. 
   West and north Lond Duven turns here slowly, before continuing 
straight once more. To the south a large gate of stout oak lies
in the wall of the Rammas Echor, towers flanking it to either side.

Lond Duven Runs East and West by the Rammas Echor~
   The Lond Duven cuts a path through Pelennor Field, the smooth 
white flagstones of the road contrasting nicely with the varying 
shades of green the expansive plains present. There is little 
movement or life out in the fields, save for the occasional 
farmer tending to his crops or a forester ensuring the safety of 
the countryside. As Lond Duven leads east to west, the stone 
wall of Rammas Echor follows its course to the south. Cut of the 
same white stone as the road, it stands twice the height of a 
man, and shields the Field and the mighty city of Minas Tirith, 
visible to the north, from any evil.

North of the Stone Wall on an East-West Stretch of Lond Duven~
   The ancient road of Lond Duven leads a straight path through 
the stretching Pelennor Field, its cobblestones white slabs set 
together without gaps between them. A few, but constant, number 
of people can be seen walking up and down the wide road, ranging 
from raggedly dressed travelers to the armoured figures of the 
highway patrol. Iron lamp posts set at periodic lengths cast 
down light onto the road when night falls, and when the day is 
high the grassy fields of Pelennor can be seen for miles around. 
   A wall built from the same stone as the road leads a parallel 
course to Lond Duven as it runs east and west. In the north the 
walls of Minas Tirith can be seen, and west lies a gate in the 
Rammas Echor.

   The sheer slopes of Mount Mindolluin rise up to the west and 
Lond Duven turns to the south, ending at a large gate in the 
stone wall the acts as a boundary to Pelennor Field. Minas 
Tirith can be seen to the north as its walls rise up into the 
mighty mountain.

Pelennor Fields, Northeast of Minas Tirith~
   Fertile soil gives growth to a multitude of things in the 
Pelennor Fields, to the green grass on the hills and fallow 
fields, to the numerous crops of wheat, barley, beans and other 
such things and to the grazing land for the herds of cattle and 
sheep that occupy the Fields. As they expand outwards in all 
directions, contained only by the Mount Mindolluin to the west 
and the Rammas Echor that forms their boundaries, the Pelennor 
Fields contain within them much of the agricultural production 
for Northern Gondor and the city Minas Tirith. 
   To the south-west the walls of the city turn from the west to 
south, the latter direction being where the mighty gates stand. A 
ways to the east a road runs past the fields.

North of the Great White Walls of Minas Tirith~
   The Pelennor Fields stretches out in all directions here, 
covering the entire countryside between the colossal Mount 
Mindolluin and the Rammas Echor. Far from being one single, flat 
plain, the Pelennor Fields contain within them cool dams and 
small bubbling streams, hillocks and mounds, great fields and 
short-growing grazing land. The occasional farmstead can be seen 
among the Fields, as well as wagons and carts making their way 
across the three roads that cross the landscape, bearing 
travellers and goods from all about Gondor. 
   To the south the fields stop short as they approach the walls 
of the noble city of Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, cut 
into the side of Mount Mindolluin.

Before the Walls of the City of Minas Tirith~
   Passage westwards through the vast Pelennor Fields ends here 
as the towering Mount Mindolluin rises up, the sheer slopes set 
at far too great an angle for any man to climb. The peak of the 
mountain to the south-west is covered in snow all year round, and 
the craggy mountain forms the western border for the entirety of 
the Fields. The ground here is rocky and rough, unsuitable for 
agriculture, but more fertile lands spread out in all directions 
away from the mountainside. 
   To the south the white walls of the fine city of Minas Tirith 
rise up, the city itself cut into the side of Mount Mindolluin, 
an arm of the mountain ranging through the city.

North and South on Lond Forodren-Annui~
   Continuing on its passage through the knee-high grass and 
farmland of the Pelennor Fields, Lond Forodren-Annui's white 
stone cobbles are passed over by every different type of person 
found in Minas Tirith and the surrounding areas. Mount 
Mindolluin's huge form keeps only a few miles from the road, 
sticking to traveller's eyes, and promising an early sunset. 
Small rabbits and birds dart out of the grass, then back in, 
almost quicker then they can be spotted. Lanterns have been hung 
alongside the road, lighting up the darkness of night. 
   The seven-tiered citadel of the Kings of Gondor, Minas Tirith 
presents its great white walls just to the southwest. Eastward 
through some scattered grass, Lond Forodren-Rhunen presses 
towards Osgiliath, the ancient capital.

   Easily visible just a few miles off to the west, Mount 
Mindolluin casts its huge form over Lond Forodren-Annui. Passing 
through the fields, white cobbles have been stomped, cracked, and 
worn into the ground over countless ages by hooves, feet, and 
wheels. Busy almost constantly, the road is lit by lanterns hung 
alongside its length, the road kept relatively safe until the 
Rammas Echor. 
   To the north and south the road of Lond Forodren-Annui 
continues, a number of travellers and guardsmen walking along its 
white cobbles.

guardsmen, and even the lowest form of vagrant, the white stones 
run past farmsteads and knee-high grass. The prominent 
easternmost peak of the White Mountains, Mount Mindolluin keeps 
its presence well-known to travelers, always being just a few 
miles from the west side of the road. Wildlife mixes with the 
many people and carts passing over the cobbles, fleeting views 
often caught by anyone looking. 
   To the west, sitting atop a hill that overlooks the 
surrounding countryside, is a large military compound.

   Curving north and east, Lond Forodren-Annui's cobbles wind 
their way through the fields, getting ever closer to the Rammas 
Echor, and further from Minas Tirith. Against the western side 
of the road, a tended field lies up against the sheer slopes of 
Mount Mindolluin. To the south, sitting atop a hill that 
overlooks the surrounding countryside, is a large military 
compound

   Crossing a small, rocky brook, white stones have been expertly 
crafted together to form a bridge. Wide enough to support the 
many travelers of the road, it has been hung with six lanterns to

often by members of Astirian's Wardens. Caravans roll over the 
stone formation quite often, while people move aside to let them

Upon the North and South Running White Cobblestones of Lond Forodren-Rhunen~
   The road of Lond Forodren-Rhunen leads its way from northeast 
to southwest through the grassy, all-embracing Pelennor Field. 
The off-white paving stones have been worn smooth by the progress 
of time, and the road is wide enough for three carts to travel 
side by side. Beside the road the vegetation is slightly 
trampled by those travelers that do not wish for the hard stones 
of Lond Forodren-Rhunen, yet the plains that expand as far as the 
eye to the north, east and south have more then enough grass to 
make up for this small loss. 
   As far as the eye can see the road continues its progress from 
the north-east to the south-west.

   The road of Lond Forodren-Rhunen leads its way from northeast 
to southwest through the grassy, all-embracing Pelennor Field. 
The off-white paving stones have been worn smooth by the progress 
of time, and the road is wide enough for three carts to travel 
side by side. Beside the road the vegetation is slightly 
trampled by those travelers that do not wish for the hard stones 
of Lond Forodren-Rhunen, yet the plains that expand as far as the 
eye to the north, east and south have more then enough grass to 
make up for this small loss.

Lond Forodren-Rhunen Running North and South~
   Tall, iron lamp posts have been placed at regular intervals at 
either side of the road as its broad white cobblestones lay down 
a path through the grass and vegetation of Pelennor Field. 
Passing by on this road are a constant number of travelers and 
merchants, walking to the sides of the Lond Forodren-Rhunen to 
avoid the carts and trade caravans that rumble up and down the 
centre of it. In all directions the green plains of Pelennor 
stretch out, and in the west sits the distant form of Mount 
Mindolluin, its snow capped peaks constantly surrounded in mist.

A Turn South and East on Lond Forodren-Rhunen~
   Lond Forodren-Rhunen recieves a slight flow of traffic no 
matter what hour of day. Well armed guardsmen walk up and down 
its length ensuring that law and order are held in place and no 
brigands threaten the goods and valubles that travel is merchant 
wagons and caravans through the road. Even lowly vagrants and 
travelers looking for work pass by on Lond Forodren-Rhunen, the 
road allowing good time to be made as opposed to trekking across 
the grassy plains of Pelennor Field. 
   This section of the mighty road leads to the southern and 
western directions of the compass point, leading from the 
northeast end of Pelennor Fields to the fair city of Minas 
Tirith, its white walls just visible to the southwest.

Pelennor Field Near a Road and a Wall~
   To the south the Rammas Echor runs, completely surrounding 
the area of the Pelennor Fields. Over twice the height of a man 
and constructed from large blocks of white stone, it is the first 
line of defence for the lands it encloses. At the base of it 
lies the well-trodden ground of the Fields, little use given to 
this particular area but as the fields spread out crops and 
livestock can be seen, carefully tended to by the farmers of the 
Pelennor Fields. 
   The Rammas Echor runs from east to west, the road of Lond 
Duven joining a course beside it to the west. The grassy plains 
spread out to the north and east.

South and East of Roads in a Trodden Plain~
   Fertile soil gives growth to a multitude of things in the 
Pelennor Fields, to the green grass on the hills and fallows 
fields, to the numerous crops of wheat, barley, beans and other 
such things and to the grazing land for the herds of cattle and 
sheep that occupy the Fields. As they expand outwards in all 
directions, contained only by the Mount Mindolluin to the west 
and the Rammas Echor that forms their boundaries, the Pelennor 
Fields contain within them much of the agricultural production 
for Northern Gondor and the city Minas Tirith. 
   To the north and to the west two roads create a border for the 
grassy plains here, dirt covering the distance between them.

North of the Rammas Echor~
   There is little life here beneath the white-stone walls of the 
Rammas Echor, the huge white wall that circles the lands of the 
Pelennor Fields to the south. An occasional guardsman can be 
seen marching across the top of the wall, looking out to the 
lands beyond for any threat to those inside the wall. The fields 
stretch out in all directions away from the Rammas Echor, with 
green hills, cool dams, and small farmsteads and grazing herds 
ready to feed a significant part of the population of Gondor. 
   The wall continues its trek through the Pelennor Fields to the 
east and west.

A Corner in the Field Created by the Stone Wall~
   To the south and east the Pelennor Fields end here, spreading out 
to the base of a twelve-foot high wall of white blocks of solid 
stone. Known as the Rammas Echor, this wall forms the borders 
and defence of the land of farmers that supply the city of Minas 
Tirith as well as other cities and towns of Gondor. The normal 
grassy ground of the Pelennor Fields is instead hard-packed dirt 
before the wall, yet the green soon picks up in all directions 
away from the Rammas Echor. 
   North and west the Rammas Echor turns here, creating a barren 
patch in the Fields.

Pelennor Fields South of Lond Forodren-Rhunen~
   From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Pelennor Fields is offered to the eye. The land has been 
divided by the numerous fences and dirt roads criss-crossing 
through it, different crops being grown showing through as 
different colours, as well as green grass of fallow fields and 
yellow of areas in need of rain. The odd tree and hillock occur 
time from time among the Fields, along with farmsteads housing 
those that work upon them to produce all sorts of agricultural 
products. The looming figure of Mount Mindolluin lies in the 
distant to the west, its craggy slopes clearly visible. 
   The fields here lay to the south of a turn in Lond 
Forodren-Rhunen as it heads west and north.

Mindolluin and the Rammas Echor. Far from being one single, flat 
plain, the Pelennor Fields contain within them cool dams and 
small bubbling streams, hillocks and mounds, great fields and 
short-growing grazing land. The occasional farmstead can be seen 
among the Fields, as well as wagons and carts making their way 
across the three roads that cross the landscape, bearing 
travellers and goods from all about Gondor.

Patchy Ground Between Two Roads~
   Farmyard fences and dirt roads divide the Pelennor Fields into 
farmer's claims, the land set to purpose ranging from livestock 
grazing to crop growing. Other parts of the Fields lay 
unclaimed, rocky outcrops and sections of stony ground left free 
from the touch of the sickle and scythe of man. Solitary trees 
and patches of light scrub dot the landscape, as do numerous 
singular cottages. A distant to the west rises up the gigantic 
form of Mount Mindolluin, its sheer slopes running the entire 
length of the Pelennor Fields. 
   This section of the Pelennor Fields lay between a road to the 
south and the west, the grass patchy after the footfall of those 
travellers that fail to stick to the cobbles.

   To the south-east the Rammas Echor runs, completely 
surrounding the area of the Pelennor Fields. Over twice the 
height of a man and constructed from large blocks of white stone,
it is the first line of defence for the lands it encloses. At 
the base of it lies the well-trodden ground of the Fields, little 
use given to this particular area but as the fields spread out 
crops and livestock can be seen, carefully tended to by the 
farmers of the Pelennor Fields. 
   To the east as well as to the south the white stone wall 
continues, preventing access from the outside into the fields.

The Rammas Echor Continues Twisting West and North~
   To the south and east, the huge white stone walls of the 
Rammas Echor rise up, circling the lands of the Pelennor Fields. 
An occasional guardsman can be seen marching across the top of 
the wall, looking out to the lands beyond for any threat to those 
within. The fields stretch out in all directions away from the 
Rammas Echor, with green hills, cool dams, and small farmsteads 
and grazing herds. 
   A large building is braced against the walls and settled into 
the corner here, the sounds of children's laughter and shouts 
often emanating from within. At all times of the day and night, 
lamps and lanterns provide light to both the structure and the 
area outside it.

Lightly Vegetated Plains~
   Farmyard fences and dirt roads divide the Pelennor Fields into 
farmer's claims, the land set to purpose ranging from livestock 
grazing to crop growing. Other parts of the Fields lay 
unclaimed, rocky outcrops and sections of stony ground left free 
from the touch of the sickle and scythe of man. Solitary trees 
and patches of light scrub dot the landscape, as do numerous 
singular cottages. A distance to the west rises up the gigantic 
form of Mount Mindolluin, its sheer slopes running the entire 
length of the Pelennor Fields. 
   The Pelennor Fields spread out in all directions.

Nearing the City of Minas Tirith in the Field~
   From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Pelennor Fields is offered to the eye. The land has been 
divided by the numerous fences and dirt roads criss-crossing 
through it, different crops being grown showing through as 
different colours, as well as green grass of fallow fields and 
yellow of areas in need of rain. The odd tree and hillock occur 
time from time among the Fields, along with farmsteads housing 
those that work upon them to produce all sorts of agricultural 
products. The looming figure of Mount Mindolluin lies in the 
distant to the west, its craggy slopes clearly visible. 
   This part of the Pelennor Fields lays just west of a broad 
highway that stretches to the north and south. The walls of the 
city Minas Tirith grow as one heads south, the city carved into 
Mount Mindolluin.

Pelennor Field East of a Paved Road~
   Fertile soil gives growth to a multitude of things in the 
Pelennor Fields, to the green grass on the hills and fallows 
fields, to the numerous crops of wheat, barley, beans and other 
such things and to the grazing land for the herds of cattle and 
sheep that occupy the Fields. As they expand outwards in all 
directions, contained only by the Mount Mindolluin to the west 
and the Rammas Echor that forms their boundaries, the Pelennor 
Fields contain within them much of the agricultural production 
for Northern Gondor and the city Minas Tirith. 
   To west a paved road leads around this section of the Pelennor 
Fields.

In the Pelennor's Grassy Plains~
   The Pelennor Fields stretch out in all directions here, 
covering the entire countryside between the colossal Mount 
Mindolluin and the Rammas Echor. Far from being one single, flat 
plain, the Pelennor Fields contain within them cool dams and 
small bubbling streams, hillocks and mounds, great fields and 
short-growing grazing land. The occasional farmstead can be seen 
among the Fields, as well as wagons and carts making their way 
across the three roads that cross the landscape, bearing 
travellers and goods from all about Gondor. 
   The Pelennor Fields continue in all directions.

Grassy Plains Bordered by the Rammas Echor~
   To the south-east the Pelennor Fields end here, spreading out 
to the base of a twelve-foot high wall of white blocks of solid 
stone. Known as the Rammas Echor, this wall forms the borders 
and defence of the land of farmers that supply the city of Minas 
Tirith as well as other cities and towns of Gondor. The normal 
grassy ground of the Pelennor Fields is instead hard-packed dirt 
before the wall, yet the green soon picks up in all directions 
away from the Rammas Echor. 
   The fields continue in all directions, though to the south and 
east they are soon cut off by the wall.

it is the first line of defence for the lands it encloses. At 
the base of it lies the well-trodden ground of the Fields, little 
use given to this particular area but as the fields spread out 
crops and livestock can be seen, carefully tended to by the 
farmers of the Pelennor Fields. 
   No movement can be made to the south or east as the tall walls 
of the Rammas Echor stand in the way. North and west, however, 
is free to the movement of feet and hoof.

Pelennor Fields Under the Shadow of the Mountain~
   Mount Mindolluin climbs out from the rough ground here to 
staggering proportions high in the sky, the rocky sides and sheer 
slopes presenting it as a symbol of raw elemental powers, untamed 
by the hand of man as are the Pelennor Fields that stretch out 
from it to the east. Snow sits packed onto its upper echelons 
and the mighty peak that lies to the south-west, and mist and low 
clouds curls around the uppermost reaches. 
   North and south the slopes of the mountain continues, while 
the Pelennor Fields stretch out to the east.

at far too great an angle for any man to climb. The peak of the 
mountain to the south-west is covered in snow all year round, and 
the craggy mountain forms the western border for the entirety of 
the Fields. The ground here is rocky and rough, unsuitable for 
agriculture, but more fertile lands spread out in all directions 
away from the mountainside. 
   The sheer slopes run to the north and south alongside the east 
of Mount Mindolluin, while to the east the tended farmland of the

Pelennor Fields Near a Small Farmstead~
   Fertile soil gives growth to a multitude of things in the 
Pelennor Fields, to the green grass on the hills and fallows 
fields, to the numerous crops of wheat, barley, beans and other 
such things and to the grazing land for the herds of cattle and 
sheep that occupy the Fields. As they expand outwards in all 
directions, contained only by the Mount Mindolluin to the west 
and the Rammas Echor that forms their boundaries, the Pelennor 
Fields contain within them much of the agricultural production 
for Northern Gondor and the city Minas Tirith. 
   To the north atop a small hillock lies a renovated farmstead.

Fields Approaching a Road to the East~
   Farmyard fences and dirt roads divide the Pelennor Fields into 
farmer's claims, the land set to purpose ranging from livestock 
grazing to crop growing. Other parts of the Fields lay 
unclaimed, rocky outcrops and sections of stony ground left free 
from the touch of the sickle and scythe of man. Solitary trees 
and patches of light scrub dot the landscape, as do numerous 
singular cottages. A distant to the west rises up the gigantic 
form of Mount Mindolluin, its sheer slopes running the entire 
length of the Pelennor Fields. 
   The fertile plains continues in all directions, save to the 
east where the grass is replaced with the hard, stone 
cobblestones of a road.

Stablehouse of the Pel-Tirith Garrison~
   Well tended too and without a doubt the subject to much 
cleaning and matinence, these stables house the many horses of 
the Pel-Tirith Garrison of the Pelennor Fields, aiding them in 
their constant patrols around the city of Minas Tirith. A score 
of wooden stalls all bear within them fine, strong horses and as 
a result the smells and sounds of the beasts fills this area. 
Constructed entirely from wood and the roof thatch, this 
stablehouse is attached to the side of a white-stone bastion, the 
wall and a door leading into it visible to the east. A set of 
double doors leads out onto the road, wide enough for two horses 
to travel abreast.

A Large Receiving Room~
   Occupying most of the first floor of the stone bastion, this 
receiving room contains a hearth providing warmth set in the 
southern wall and a number of lamps lit at all times, dispelling 
any shadows and darkness from this place. A short stairwell has 
been set in the northwest corner of the room, leading to the 
second floor, while stout oak doors lie in the east, west and 
northern stonework. Bright tapestries adorn the walls, 
protraying scenes of hunting and farm life. The sword before a 
seven-pointed star symbol of Greathouse Astirian has been painted 
across the high stone ceiling repeatedly. 
   The aides and clerks of Lord Astirian bustle in and out of the 
large room, sometimes heading up or down the stairwell as they 
carry out their duties.

Well-kept Kitchen~
   Although the space allocated to this kitchen entrusted with 
cooking and preparing meals for the Pel-Tirith Garrison is far 
from large, it has been organized and is maintained with an iron 
fist, dust and cobwebs a rare site in this room. White stone 
walls rise up in all directions, and a small archway with a blue 
curtain draped over it has been cut into the southern wall. In 
the north east corner a small clear space from the racks, shelves 
and cupboards of the kitchen holds a trapdoor.

An Organized Cellar~
   Stretching underneath the entire bastion, this cellar is as a 
result rather large. The white stone walls that have been cut 
into the earth keep the cool feel to the air here, but damp and 
mould are lacking in order to keep provisions stored down here in 
untouched conditions. Shelves, racks and chests bear in them 
many long term foods and barrels of liquid, but some fresher food 
as well as raw ingredients can be seen in their own location. 
Through the wooden timber ceiling of the cellar the faint sound 
of voices can be made out, and set in the north-east corner is a 
small staircase leading out.

Watch Tower~
   The crenelated top of the white-stone bastion provides an 
excellent view of the Penellor Fields and all that passes through 
on them. During the daytime one can see past the edges of the 
three roads that stretch through the plains and all the travelers 
that move along them. A trap door set in the north-west corner 
allows movement back inside the stone structure, and four iron 
brackets driven into the floor hold torches to burn during the 
night.

Patchy Grass in the Fields~
   The Pelennor Fields stretch out in all directions here, 
covering the entire countryside between the colossal Mount 
Mindolluin and the Rammas Echor. Far from being one single, flat 
plain, the Pelennor Fields contain within them cool dams and 
small bubbling streams, hillocks and mounds, great fields and 
short-growing grazing land. The occasional farmstead can be seen 
among the Fields, as well as wagons and carts making their way 
across the three roads that cross the landscape, bearing 
travellers and goods from all about Gondor. 
   To the south-west the Rammas Echor, the white stone wall that 
surrounds the Pelennor Fields, can be seen.

The Pelennor Fields Follows the White-stone Wall as it Leads North and South~
   To the east the Rammas Echor runs, completely surrounding the 
area of the Pelennor Fields. Over twice the height of a man and 
constructed from large blocks of white stone, it is the first 
line of defence for the lands it encloses. At the base of it 
lies the well-trodden ground of the Fields, little use given to 
this particular area but as the fields spread out crops and 
livestock can be seen, carefully tended to by the farmers of the 
Pelennor Fields. The Rammas Echor continues in a strong, 
straight line to the north and to the south, the bright white of 
its wall scorched here and blackened.

Pelennor Fields at the Base of a Gigantic Snow-Capped Mountain~
   Rough ground strewn with rocks and stones rather then the 
normal grass of the Pelennor Fields stretches far up to the north 
and south here, spreading as far as the eastern slopes of the 
mighty Mount Mindolluin, the last peak in the White Mountain 
Range that spreads through Gondor. Rocky, craggy and 
snow-capped, the mountain is colossal in size, the peak looming 
over everything below and its slopes far too treacherous for any 
attempt to climb or pass them to the west. 
   To the east the ground becomes more green and grassy, suited 
for agriculture by human hands. To the north and south however, 
the rough ground continues along the mountainside. 
   A small arch of rock seems to offer passage to huge, 
moss-covered slippery stone steps leading up behind a sheer 
chimney of granite.

Grassy Plain West of a Wide Road~
   From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Pelennor Fields is offered to the eye. The land has been 
divided by the numerous fences and dirt roads criss-crossing 
through it, different crops being grown showing through as 
different colours, as well as green grass of fallow fields and 
yellow of areas in need of rain. The odd tree and hillock occur 
time from time among the Fields, along with farmsteads housing 
those that work upon them to produce all sorts of agricultural 
products. The looming figure of Mount Mindolluin lies in the 
distant to the west, its craggy slopes clearly visible. 
   The grass to the east is slightly trampled, no doubt by those 
who have veered off the road Lond Forodren-Annui that runs from 
the north to the south a short distance to the east.

beyond for any threat to those inside the wall. The fields 
stretch out in all directions away from the Rammas Echor, with

from it to the east. Snow sits packed onto its upper echelons 
and the mighty peak that lies to the south-west, and mist and low 
clouds curls around the upper-most reaches.

Under the Sheer Slopes of Mount Mindolluin~
   Passage westwards through the vast Pelennor Fields ends here 
as the towering Mount Mindolluin rises up, the sheer slopes set 
at far too great an angle for any man to climb. The peak of the 
mountain to the south-west is covered in snow all year round, and 
the craggy mountain forms the western border for the entirety of 
the Fields. The ground here is rocky and rough, unsuitable for 
agriculture, but more fertile lands spread out in all directions 
away from the mountainside. 
   To the north a brook cascades down the mountain side and runs 
east through the Pelennor Fields. Southwards the mountain 
continues, while east grassy plains spread out alongside the 
stream.

In a Babbling Brook, Cascading Down the Mountain~
   Rough ground strewn with rocks and stones rather then the 
normal grass of the Pelennor Fields stretches far up to the north 
and south here, spreading as far as the eastern slopes of the 
mighty Mount Mindolluin, the last peak in the White Mountain 
Range that spreads through Gondor. Rocky, craggy and 
snow-capped, the mountain is colossal in size, the peak looming 
over everything below and its slopes far too treacherous for any 
attempt to climb or pass them to the west. 
   A bubbling, babbling brook streams down from the slopes of the 
mountain, gathering in a large pond before cutting a path to the 
east through the rocky ground and then further on through the 
Pelennor Fields.

Rough Land Beneath the Mountains~
   Mount Mindolluin climbs out from the rough ground here to 
staggering proportions high in the sky, the rocky sides and sheer 
slopes presenting it as a symbol of raw elemental powers, untamed 
by the hand of man as are the Pelennor Fields that stretch out 
from it to the east. Snow sits packed onto its upper echelons 
and the mighty peak that lies to the south-west, and mist and low 
clouds curls around the upper-most reaches.
   The slopes of the mountain turn slightly here, blocking access 
to the north as well as to the west. Southwards a small stream 
runs down from Mount Mindolluin. The mountain continues to the 
north, cutting through the Rammas Echor. A small, pallisaded camp
has been set up at the source of the stream, which has been
used to feed some sort of machinery with a large water-wheel.

On a Hard-Packed Trail North of a Brook~
   There is little life here beneath the white-stone walls of the 
Rammas Echor, the huge white wall that circles the lands of the 
Pelennor Fields to the north and west. An occasional guardsman 
can be seen marching across the top of the wall, looking out to 
the lands beyond for any threat to those inside the wall. The 
fields stretch out in all directions away from the Rammas Echor, 
with green hills, cool dams, and small farmsteads and grazing 
herds ready to feed a significant part of the population of 
Gondor. 
   A trail leads east and west here, where the mighty Mount 
Mindolluin cuts through the Rammas Echor as it leaves the 
Pelennor Fields to the north before turning to run to the 
north-west into the White Mountains. The wall has been built a 
short distance into the rock for stability, and continues on as 
the boundary to the Pelennor Fields to the north.

A Turn in the Rammas Echor, West of Lond Forodren-Annui~
   To the north and west the Pelennor Fields end here, spreading 
out to the base of a twelve-foot high wall of white blocks of 
solid stone. Known as the Rammas Echor, this wall forms the 
borders and defence of the land of farmers that supply the city 
of Minas Tirith as well as other cities and towns of Gondor. The 
normal grassy ground of the Pelennor Fields is instead 
hard-packed dirt before the wall, yet the green soon picks up in 
all directions away from the Rammas Echor. 
   To the east lies Lond Forodren-Annui, one of the three roads 
that cut through the Pelennor Fields. Mount Mindolluin rises up 
to the west, while the Rammas Echor leads south and east. 
   A reinforced door is built into the wall here.

crops and livestock can be seen, carefully tended to by the 
farmers of the Pelennor Fields. 
   Westwards lies one of the three gates of the Pelennor Field, 
this one allowing access to the countryside of Anorien, Gondor's 
northern most province.

plain, the Pelennor Fields contain within them cool dams and 
small bubbling streams, hillocks and mounds, great fields and 
short-growing grazing land. The occasional farmstead can be seen 
among the Fields, as well as wagons and carts making their way 
across the three roads that cross the landscape, bearing 
travellers and goods from all about Gondor. 
   To the north a babbling brook streams past, the sandy shores 
soon giving way to a deeper undercurrent. Eastwards lies a

Passing the Pelennor Fields in a Babbling Brook~
   Clear waters slowly flow out from the high slopes of Mount 
Mindolluin to the west carry through the rock bottom and sandy 
shores of the brook here as it passes through the Pelennor 
Fields. Plant life grows abundantly along the edge of the shore 
to the north and south, and dragonflies skitter above the surface 
of the water. Deep enough to fully submerge a man, the brook 
runs to a stop to the east, and under a bridge to the west. 
   A small mill sits on the banks here, waterwheel turning gently 
in the flow of the brook.

Wardog's Common~
   This large common has set on display weapons, suits of old 
armor, and battered shields. Hung centrally from the large 
rafters of the ceiling, an iron lantern has been hung with 
battle-scarred helmets, the light emanating from the eye slits. 
A bar runs along the northeastern corner, lined with candles 
sitting atop broken helms. Filled with many guards which it has 
been named after, the tavern is abustle with activity, commoners 
and warriors alike. 
   Southwards, an iron-bound door leads out onto Lond 
Forodren-Annui, and eventually the Rammas Echor or Minas Tirith.
Behind the bar, a simple wooden door leads to the stables, while 
a small staircase leads to the floor above.

The Expanse of the Pelennor Fields~
   From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Pelennor Fields is offered to the eye. The land has been 
divided by the numerous fences and dirt roads criss-crossing 
through it, different crops being grown showing through as 
different colours, as well as green grass of fallow fields and 
yellow of areas in need of rain. The odd tree and hillock occur 
time from time among the Fields, along with farmsteads housing 
those that work upon them to produce all sorts of agricultural 
products. The looming figure of Mount Mindolluin lies in the 
distant to the west, its craggy slopes clearly visible.

Peaceful Countryside~
   Farmyard fences and dirt roads divide the Pelennor Fields into 
farmer's claims, the land set to purpose ranging from livestock 
grazing to crop growing. Other parts of the Fields lay 
unclaimed, rocky outcrops and sections of stony ground left free 
from the touch of the sickle and scythe of man. Solitary trees 
and patches of light scrub dot the landscape, as do numerous 
singular cottages. A distant to the west rises up the gigantic 
form of Mount Mindolluin, its sheer slopes running the entire 
length of the Pelennor Fields. 
   The way southwards is blocked by a gently rising hill, a path 
rising to a gate set at the top.

Green Plains~
   Fertile soil gives growth to a multitude of things in the 
Pelennor Fields, to the green grass on the hills and fallows 
fields, to the numerous crops of wheat, barley, beans and other 
such things and to the grazing land for the herds of cattle and 
sheep that occupy the Fields. As they expand outwards in all 
directions, contained only by the Mount Mindolluin to the west 
and the Rammas Echor that forms their boundaries, the Pelennor 
Fields contain within them much of the agricultural production 
for Northern Gondor and the city Minas Tirith. 
   Nothing disturbs the vast farmlands and fields of the Pelennor 
Fields for all directions except for a hill that rises gently
to the southwest.

Fertile Landscape~

covering the entire countryside between the colossal Mount 
Mindolluin and the Rammas Echor. Far from being one single, flat 
plain, the Pelennor Fields contain within them cool dams and 
small bubbling streams, hillocks and mounds, great fields and 
short-growing grazing land. The occasional farmstead can be seen 
among the Fields, as well as wagons and carts making their way 
across the three roads that cross the landscape, bearing 
travellers and goods from all about Gondor. 
   North, east, south and west sees a continuation of the

Known as the Rammas Echor, this wall forms the borders and 
defence of the land of farmers that supply the city of Minas 
Tirith as well as other cities and towns of Gondor. The normal 
grassy ground of the Pelennor Fields is instead hard-packed dirt 
before the wall, yet the green soon picks up in all directions

West of a Curve in Lond Forodren-Rhunen~
 From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Pelennor Fields is offered to the eye. The land has been 
divided by the numerous fences and dirt roads criss-crossing 
through it, different crops being grown showing through as 
different colours, as well as green grass of fallow fields and 
yellow of areas in need of rain. The odd tree and hillock occur
from time to time among the Fields, along with farmsteads housing
those that work upon them to produce all sorts of agricultural 
products. The looming figure of Mount Mindolluin lies in the 
distance to the west, its craggy slopes clearly visible.
   To the east a curve in the road of Lond Forodren-Rhunen

East off Lond Forodren-Annui~
   From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Pelennor Fields is offered to the eye. The land has been 
divided by the numerous fences and dirt roads criss-crossing 
through it, different crops being grown showing through as
different colours, as well as green grass of fallow fields and 
yellow of areas in need of rain. The odd tree and hillock occur 
time from time among the Fields, along with farmsteads housing 
those that work upon them to produce all sorts of agricultural
products. The looming figure of Mount Mindolluin lies in the
distance to the west, its craggy slopes clearly visible.
   Lond Forodren-Annui leads on north and south a short distance 
to the west, while the sandy shores of a clear-water stream lay
in the southern direction of the compass points.

Farmland North of a Small Lake~
   Farmyard fences and dirt roads divide the Pelennor Fields into 
farmer's claims, the land set to purpose ranging from livestock 
grazing to crop growing. Other parts of the Fields lay 
unclaimed, rocky outcrops and sections of stony ground left free 
from the touch of the sickle and scythe of man. Solitary trees 
and patches of light scrub dot the landscape, as do numerous 
singular cottages. A distant to the west rises up the gigantic 
form of Mount Mindolluin, its sheer slopes running the entire 
length of the Pelennor Fields. 
   A small lake lies to the south in the Pelennor Fields, fed by 
a babbling brook that flows in from the west.

Farmland of the Pelennor Fields~
   The Pelennor Fields stretch out in all directions here, 
covering the entire countryside between the colossal Mount 
Mindolluin and the Rammas Echor. Far from being one single, flat 
plain, the Pelennor Fields contain within them cool dams and 
small bubbling streams, hillocks and mounds, great fields and 
short-growing grazing land. The occasional farmstead can be seen 
among the Fields, as well as wagons and carts making their way 
across the three roads that cross the landscape, bearing 
travellers and goods from all about Gondor. 
   In all directions the Pelennor Fields lay.

Pelennor Fields, to the green grass on the hills and fallows 
fields, to the numerous crops of wheat, barley, beans and other 
such things and to the grazing land for the herds of cattle and 
sheep that occupy the Fields. As they expand outwards in all 
directions, contained only by the Mount Mindolluin to the west 
and the Rammas Echor that forms their boundaries, the Pelennor 
Fields contain within them much of the agricultural production 
for Northern Gondor and the city Minas Tirith. 
   In a short distance to the north and north-east the Rammas 
Echor can be seen, signaling the end of the Pelennor Fields.

A Turn in the Stone Wall~
   To the north and east the Rammas Echor runs, completely 
surrounding the area of the Pelennor Fields. Over twice the 
height of a man and constructed from large blocks of white stone, 
it is the first line of defence for the lands it encloses. At 
the base of it lies the well-trodden ground of the Fields, little 
use given to this particular area but as the fields spread out 
crops and livestock can be seen, carefully tended to by the 
farmers of the Pelennor Fields. 
   As the Rammas Echor turns from heading north to east here, a 
large rocky outcrop lies to the south, preventing movement in 
that direction.

Pelennor Fields South of the Rammas Echor~
   To the north the Pelennor Fields end here, spreading out to 
the base of a twelve-foot high wall of white blocks of solid 
stone. Known as the Rammas Echor, this wall forms the borders 
and defence of the land of farmers that supply the city of Minas 
Tirith as well as other cities and towns of Gondor. The normal 
grassy ground of the Pelennor Fields is instead hard-packed dirt 
before the wall, yet the green soon picks up in all directions 
away from the Rammas Echor. 
   Southwards farmland of the Pelennor Fields lie, the colours of 
agriculture a strong contrast to the dull white of the stone of 
the Rammas Echor that leads east and west.

South-West of a White-Stoned Wall~
   There is little life here beneath the white-stone walls of the 
Rammas Echor, the huge white wall that circles the lands of the 
Pelennor Fields to the north and east. An occasional guardsman 
can be seen marching across the top of the wall, looking out to 
the lands beyond for any threat to those inside the wall. The 
fields stretch out in all directions away from the Rammas Echor, 
with green hills, cool dams, and small farmsteads and grazing 
herds ready to feed a significant part of the population of 
Gondor. 
   Curving south and west, the Rammas Echor continues its trek 
around the boundaries of the Pelennor Fields.

abruptly to the south here. A wall over twice the height of a 
normal man and constructed from blocks of white stone prevents 
any further movement in that direction, the lands beyond them 
known as the Pelennor Fields. Leading up to the wall, known as 
the Rammas Echor, the vegetation thins before becoming little 
more then dirt at the base of its formation. 
   Steep and treacherous to travel, the slopes of Mount 
Mindolluin rise up, completely halting all travel to the west, 
its craggy features visible from many miles around. To the east 
the Rammas Echor stands, while a field lies to the north.

   The normal grass and farmland of the lands of Anorien come to 
a halt as they reach the base of the Rammas Echor, the mighty 
stone wall that acts as the first layer of defense to the city of 
Minas Tirith that lies within. There are few holdings in front 
of the walls, the land periodically cleared by soldiers of the 
city to ensure any enemy attacking is deprived of cover of any 
sort. The tended land of Anorien lies to the north. 
   To the west the massive figure of Mount Mindolluin can be seen 
as its unscaleable slopes begins to turn from south to west, 
leading back along the White Mountains. A narrow trail ascends 
up the mountain to the west, large boulders and newly disturbed 
dirt covering the area.

North of a Gate in the Rammas Echor on Lond Anorien~
   Coursing its way through the vast countryside of Anorien, the 
northernmost province of Gondor, this road keeps for the most 
part a straight course. Small villages and hamlets, tended 
fields, herds of livestock and the occasional keep and bastion 
are all passed by the road at sporadic intervals. Grainy white 
stone makes up most of the path, wide enough to bear two 
carriages, yet grey and black stones are not uncommon, and every 
now and again a pothole can be seen in the road. 
   The road runs to the north, while to the south the white walls 
of Rammas Echor rise up, a wooden gate bounded by iron bands set 
at the start of the road in it.

abruptly to the south here. A wall over twice the height of a 
normal man and constructed from blocks of white stone prevents 
any further movement in that direction, the lands beyond them 
known as the Pelennor Fields. Leading up to the wall, known as 
the Rammas Echor, the vegetation thins before becoming little 
more then dirt at the base of its formation. 
   A simple log cabin is here, only a skeleton remaining of its 
once robust manner. Two of the four walls remain standing, bits 
of belongings, charred and useless, littering the ground within. 
The cabin looks as if it were once surrounded by trees but these, 
too, have been fire-ravaged. 
   West a road made of white cobblestones leads into the Rammas 
Echor and off north through the landscape.

Anorien Countryside Off a Turn in the Highway~
   While not overly so, the lands of Anorien are fertile enough 
to provide a decent livelihood to the farmers that tend to the 
land and their livestock upon it. Bordered to the north and east 
by the wide River Anduin, the countryside of Northern Gondor is 
peaceful at most times as its inhabitants go about their daily 
business. The colossal shape of Mount Mindolluin is always 
present to the west, as are the White Mountains that stretch out 
further beyond it. 
   To the south as well as to the east the highway Lond Caras-Mir 
heads off through the farmlands and fallow fields.

Before the Gate of the Rammas Echor~
   Lond Caras-Mir, the road that branches the distance between 
the ancient city of Osgiliath and the walls of the Pelennor 
Fields, runs through the countryside of Anorien here. Basalt and 
some type of white rock have been down side by side as the paving 
stones of the road, creating a contrasting pattern of light and 
dark that has been faded and worn away by time. Only a few 
people make their way along the road, the majority of them 
farmers, taking their wares to and from the city and countryside. 
   The Rammas Echor, the stalwart stone wall that protects the 
Pelennor Fields, lies to the west, a large wooden gate bound with 
iron bands set in it as the base of Lond Caras-Mir. Lanterns 
flank the road for a short distance here as it runs out to the 
east.

   The normal grass and farmland of the lands of Anorien come to 
a halt as they reach the base of the Rammas Echor, the mighty 
stone wall that acts as the first layer of defence to the city of 
Minas Tirith that lies within. There are few holdings in front 
of the walls, the land periodically cleared by soldiers of the 
city to ensure any enemy attacking is deprived of cover of any 
sort. The tended land of Anorien lies to the north. 
   To the north a gate lies in the white stone wall, a road 
leading out east from it.

Nearing the River Anduin to the South by the Rammas Echor~
   Stretching many miles from east to west, the Rammas Echor 
signals the end of the Gondorian fiefdom of Anorien here. Built 
from large blocks of white stone, the crenulated battlements are 
constantly patrolled by heavily armed soldiers ensuring the 
safety of the lands inside the walls to the south. The 
vegetation here consists mainly of dirt and patches of grass, but 
in the distance to the north farmlands can be seen. 
   As the dirt before the wall continues to the south, the waters 
of the River Anduin can be seen as the Rammas Echor is built 
directly above its cool grasp.

The Rammas Echor at the River Anduin~
   Here the Rammas Echor meets perfectly flush with the glassy 
waters of the River Anduin. Knee-high grasslands sprawl out to 
the northeast, following the gently curving river bank. The 
grass moves with any wind, brushing past in a wave. Small 
animals dart in and out of the grasses to the river, pausing if 
only for a moment to clean their bodies in the waters, then 
disapearing quickly, back into the long grass. Sand and dirt mix 
together to form the riverbank, running under the current in an 
easy slope. 
   To the west, the great white wall of the Rammas Echor prevents 
any travel. North, the riverbank opens further into the grassy 
interior of the landscape of Anorien.

Sandy Shore of the River Anduin~
   With a slight inward curve, the River Anduin keeps to the 
western bank, flowing alongside in an easy, fluid manner. Easily 
sloping underwater, the dirt mixed sand is lapped by the swiftly 
moving river. The bank extends the width of twenty feet or so, 
breaking suddenly into thin, knee-high grass which waves with the 
movement of the air about it. Small animals dart in and out of 
the grass, leave tracks in the mud and then disappear as quickly 
as they appeared. 
   The western shore of the river continues to the east, meeting 
the structure of a tall white wall to the south west.

Green Fields Off Lond Caras-Mir to the North~
   In the distance to the west, no matter where one stands here, 
the towering peak of Mount Mindolluin and the White Mountains 
that stretch out beyond it is always visible, capped with snow 
and often cloaked in mist. Through this area grassy fallow 
fields and small hillocks vie for space between rows of planted 
crops and grazing livestock, the situation repeated throughout 
the lands of Anorien in Northern Gondor. A light copse of 
woodland can be seen to the north, the Heledhnen flowing out 
from behind it. 
   The sandy shore of the River Anduin can be seen to the south 
and east, while a paved road lies to the north.

Western Shore of the River Anduin~
   Here the countryside of Anorien reaches the western bank of 
the great River Anduin. Composed mainly of sand and dirt mixed 
with the occasional scattering of stone and rock, it slopes 
easily into the swiftly flowing river to the east. Tall grass 
begins just before the shore to the west before spreading out 
into the farmland and roads of the landscape of Northern Gondor. 
   The shoreline continues to the north-east and to the south, 
while to the west a field of knee-high grass lies.

Curve in the Shore of the River~
   Curving gently from the west to the north, the River Anduin's 
sand and dirt bank widens a bit, forcing back the encroaching 
grassland. Far across the river's waters, the eastern bank can 
be spotted, almost out of sight in bad weather. A few birds fly 
quickly overhead, fast enough to avoid any predators in the sky, 
and high enough as not to be snagged by a hidden danger in the 
grass. 
   The course of the river forces the bank to move to the north 
and west.

Green Fields Near Lond Caras-Mir~
   In the fiefdom of Anorien, a complacent peace and calm hold 
over the many small towns and isolated farms that dot the 
landscape of fields and gentle green hills. The regular patrol 
of soldiers belonging to the local lords of the land upon the 
roads and highways that cut through Northern Gondor ensures that 
no harm can come to the valuable agricultural land of the mighty 
country. To the west, the countryside expands onwards for 
hundreds of miles, unhindered by anything, while the tributary of 
Heledhnen and the River Anduin act as the northern and eastern 
borders of this section of Anorien. 
   A paved road bearing a light stream of traffic lies to the 
east. A path that leads from the paved road to the east winds 
its way through Anorien toward a fenced vineyard.

Lond Caras-Mir Leads East and West~
   Wide enough to bear two wagons next to each other upon it, the 
road of Lond Caras-Mir rarely sees such traffic in these times, 
the black-and-white pattern created by the cobbles in disarray 
with the numerous potholes in the path. An occasional guard 
patrol or a farmer bearing a cart full of goods for a city market 
is all the excitement the road sees now. The grass beside the 
road grows high and untamed, and the gentle farmlands of Anorien 
can be seen to the north and west, the River Anduin flowing 
swiftly not far to the east. 
   Lond Caras-Mir runs from east to west through the farmland of 
Anorien. To the west it approaches a large gate in white stone 
wall known as the Rammas Echor.

North and West Lond Caras-Mir Turns~
   The bleak ramparts of the ruins of Osgiliath, once the capital 
of Gondor, rise up a distance to the north-east, what remains of 
the city itself located over the running waters of the broad 
River Anduin. A slight, sporadic flow of farmers, vagrants and 
guardsmen walk on past on the wide road, giving little attention 
to much save themselves. To the south-west the White Mountains 
stretch off to west, disappearing over the horizon, while not far 
off the road to the east the western shore of the River Anduin 
lies. Closer off Lond Caras-Mir lies irrigated farmland and 
fallow fields. 
   The cobblestones slowly curving, the road turns from north to 
west here.

   Lond Caras-Mir, the road that branches the distance between 
the ruins of the city of Osgiliath and the walls of the Pelennor 
Fields, runs through the countryside of Anorien here. Basalt and 
some type of white rock have been lain down side by side as the 
paving stones of the road, creating a contrasting pattern of 
light and dark that has been faded and worn way by time. Only a 
few people make their way along the road. The majority of them 
are farmers who take their wares to and from the city and 
countryside. The straight set course of the black-and-white 
cobbled road continues to the north and south.

   Here the countryside of Anorien reaches the western bank of 
the great River Anduin. Composed mainly of sand and dirt mixed 
with the occasional scattering of stone and rock, it slopes 
easily into the swiftly flowing river to the east. Tall grass

is marked by a slight uphill climb.

Fallow Field Near Mount Mindolluin~
   While not overly so, the lands of Anorien are fertile enough 
to provide a decent livelihood to the farmers that tend to the 
land and their livestock upon it. Bordered to the north by the 
Heledhnen and to the east by the wide River Anduin, this portion 
of the countryside of Northern Gondor is peaceful at most times 
as its inhabitants go about their daily business. The colossal 
shape of Mount Mindolluin is always present to the south-west, as 
are the White Mountains that stretch out further beyond it. 
   South and west the gigantic Mount Mindolluin rises, flanked by 
other lesser peaks of the White Mountains, while southwards it

West of a Black and White Cobbled Road~
   A rustic atmosphere lies settled over the countryside of 
Anorien, those lands west of the River Anduin and north of the 
cathedral Minas Tirith. The labours of agriculture spread out 
for the eye to see, farmers caring for to their crops and 
shepherds managing their herds during the day and at night the 
villages and farmsteads that dot the land casting out points of 
light in the distance. A few travellers can be seen moving 
through the tended lands rather then walk upon the more crowded 
highways that cut through Anorien. 
   To the east a road made up of black and white cobblestones 
runs north to south through the countryside. What remains of a 
small cabin is here, burnt down to its foundation, with the trees 
around it blackened and scorched.

Lond Anorien Runs a Straight Course North and South~
   An occasional wagon or traveller passes by on the 
white-cobbled road here as well as patrols of guardsmen from some 
of the townships in the countryside in northern Gondor. To the 
south-west the gigantic, winding chain that is the White 
Mountains stretches from over the horizon to the west, ending at 
a large peak far to the south. Fields stretch out from the road, 
some tended by the hands of man, the mouth of cattle or sheep, or 
left fallow, while the road leads on oblivious to them all. 
   The fields of Anorien lay to the east and west as the road 
continues a straight cut course north and south. In a distance 
to the south a stone wall can be seen stretching east and west.

land and their livestock upon it. Bordered to the north by the 
Heledhnen and to the east by the wide River Anduin, this portion 
of the countryside of Northern Gondor is peaceful at most times 
as its inhabitants go about their daily business. The colossal 
shape of Mount Mindolluin is always present to the south-west, as 
are the White Mountains that stretch out further beyond it. 
   The lands of Anorien continue in all directions.

Fertile Landscape~
   A rustic atmosphere lies settled over the countryside of 
Anorien, those lands west of the River Anduin and north of the 
cathedral Minas Tirith. The labours of agriculture spread out 
for the eye to see, farmers caring for their crops and shepherds 
managing their herds during the day, and at night the villages 
and farmsteads that dot the land casting out points of light in 
the distance. A few travellers can be seen moving through the 
tended lands rather than walk upon the more crowded highways that 
cut through Anorien. 
   In all directions of the compass point the lands of Anorien 
continue as far as the eye can see.

Tended Countryside West of a Road~
   In the distance to the south-west, no matter where one stands
here, the towering peak of Mount Mindolluin and the White 
Mountains that stretch out beyond it is always visible, capped
with snow and often cloaked in mist. Through this area grassy
fallow fields and small hillocks vie for space between rows of
planted crops and grazing livestock, the situation repeated
throughout the lands of Anorien in Northern Gondor. A light
copse of woodland can  be seen to east, a pair of weathered gates
rising out from behind it.
   A short distance to the east leads onto the broad highway of 
Lond Caras-Mir. A farm can be seen nigh to here, parts of the 
farm appear to be made of newer wood, while others are from a
much older stock.

Lond Caras-Mir Turns South and East~
   The grey walls of an abandoned city, once known as Osgiliath, 
the former capital of Gondor, rise up a distance to the 
north-east, the ruin of the city itself located over the running 
waters of the broad River Anduin. A slight, sporadic flow of 
farmers, vagrants and guardsmen walk on past on the wide road, 
giving little attention to much save themselves. To the 
south-west the White Mountains stretch off to west, disappearing 
over the horizon, while not far off the road to the east the 
western shore of the River Anduin lies. Closer off Lond 
Caras-Mir lies irrigated farmland and fallow fields. 
   To the south Lond Caras-Mir forms onto a straight path, while 
to the east it rises, sloping upward past two crumbled towers to 
a pair of weathered gates.

West Shore of River Anduin, North of a Bleak City~
   With a slight inward curve, the River Anduin keeps to the 
western bank, flowing alongside in an easy, fluid manner. Easily 
sloping underwater, the dirt mixed sand is lapped by the swiftly 
moving river. The bank extends the width of twenty feet or so, 
breaking suddenly into thin, knee-high grass which waves with the 
movement of the air about it. Small animals dart in and out of 
the grass, leave tracks in the mud and then disappear as quickly 
as they appeared.

The River Anduin Meets a Tributary~
   Fed by the length of a clear tributary here, the River Anduin 
stretches north to south. Its sand and dirt bank widens a bit, 
forcing back the encroaching grassland. Far across the river's 
waters, the eastern bank can be spotted, almost out of sight in 
bad weather. A few birds fly quickly overhead, fast enough to 
avoid any predators in the sky, and high enough as not to be 
snagged by a hidden danger in the grass. 
   The sandy shore continues to the south and west while to the 
north lies a mill along the river, at the end of a small path.

Wooded Western Shore of a Clear Tributary~
   Numerous birch trees rise up high overhead here, forcing those 
who travel through this area to negotiate over the large roots 
and felled trees. Moss and other lichen grow at the base of the 
trees, whilst upward along their trunks sits the silver bark of 
the birch, feeling smooth to the touch. Green toothed leaves 
hang from the drooping branches of the trees here, some 
interwoven in a woodland canopy. 
   The trees end abruptly to the north-east as the clear waters 
of a tributary stream flow past the roots of the birch trees that 
have extended out into the river. 
   The burnt, ruined remains of a windmill are here, only bits
and pieces of the structure left to indicate what it once was.

Birch Tree Canopy Over the Forested Tributary Shore~
   A thick canopy of boughs and other smaller branches of the 
tall birch trees here has been woven between the many mature 
trees that sprout up from the ground here. The quiet rustlings 
and scampering movements of small forest creatures can be heard 
occasionally in this woodland, the dense layer of smaller plants 
and trees around the feet providing cover against larger 
predators. 
   The forested shore of the tributary known as Heledhnen 
continues to the west and south, the fast flowing currents of the 
river flowing past the large roots of the birch trees set in the 
waters. 
   A freshly dug barrow stands out at the end of a short path
through these woods, not far back from the shores of the river.

   Birch trees heavily populate this patch of woods. Older, more 
dominating birches spread their expansive canopies over the 
younger, struggling saplings. While not thick enough to impede 
travel, the encompassing undergrowth, composed of varied bushes 
intertwined with snake-like vines, is substantial enough to hide 
the multitudes of wild critters that make it their home. 
   To the north-east here the spread of the birch tree canopy

Forested Shore of a Tributary~
   Tall birch trees with smooth, silver bark clamber up towards 
the sky here, their drooping branches interwoven so thickly that 
during the day light from the sun must filter past the small, 
green, edged leaves. A thick undergrowth of various shrubs and 
plants, as well as younger birch saplings, crowds around the base 
of the wide trunks of the birches, slowing movement through this 
area. 
   To the north and east a slender tributary runs over the roots 
of the birch trees, water reeds and other river plants sprouting 
out from the edges of the stream as its shore continues to the 
south and west.

Birch Trees Growing Upon the Shore of a Clear Tributary~
   Numerous birch trees rise up high overhead here, forcing those 
who travel through this area to negotiate over the large roots 
and felled trees. Moss and lichen grow at the base of the trees, 
whilst upward along their trunks sits the silver bark of the 
birch, feeling smooth to the touch. Green toothed leaves hang 
from the drooping branches of the trees here, some interwoven in 
a woodland canopy. 
   The birch wood ends here to the north as it approaches the 
southern shore of the tributary named Heledhnen, the current of 
the stream taking past many fallen leaves and branches 
downstream.

Heledhnen Shoreline by Thinning Woodland~
A thick canopy of boughs and other smaller branches of the 
tall birch trees here has been woven between the many mature 
trees that sprout up from the ground here. The quiet rustlings 
and scampering movements of small forest creatures can be heard 
occasionally in this woodland, the dense layer of smaller plants 
and trees around the feet providing cover against larger 
predators.
   To the west the birch woodland quickly thins out until it 
reaches the border of a white-cobbled highway. Here, however, 
the branches of the trees droop over the clear waters that flow 
west to east infront under them to the north. A large compound 
is nestled at the border of the woodland near the shore of the 
river.

At a Bend in the Lond Anorien, by the Shores of the Heledhnen~
   As the tributary stream of Heledhnen cuts a path east to west 
here, the Lond Anorien bends from south to west, following the 
line of the streambank. The sound of the rushing water of the 
choppy tributary fills the air, the water broken by smooth river 
stones that peek above the surface. To the east the shoreline 
stretches on, where it nears the fringes of a sparse birch 
woodland. To the northwest a small cluster of buildings huddle 
along the northern bank of the tributary, barely visible in the 
distance. 
   The highway continues to the south, and to the west, where it 
comes to the base of a small stone bridge that traverses the 
breadth of the Heledhnen.

The Lond Anorien, Before a Bridge Over a Tributary~
   Curving in gently from the west, the Lond Anorien ends here at 
the base of a low stone bridge, solidly built and equal in 
breadth to the roadway. The bridge curves over the extent of a 
glassy-watered tributary, known as the Heledhnen. The shore of 
the tributary continues east and west, while the pastures of 
Anorien lie to the south. To the north rises the bridge, which 
joins again with the Lond Anorien as it passes through a small 
cluster of buildings near the shoreline. 
   The Lond Anorien itself presses on to the east while just off 
the road, a small, stone-lined path leads up to a nearby 
farmstead. 
   Tall poles mounted with brass lanterns are mounted on either
side of the bridge providing light to the surrounding area at
night.

Farmlands West of a Cobbled Road~
   While not overly so, the lands of Anorien are fertile enough 
to provide a decent livelihood to the farmers that tend to the 
land and their livestock upon it. Bordered to the north by the 
Heledhnen and to the east by the wide River Anduin, this portion 
of the countryside of Northern Gondor is peaceful at most times 
as its inhabitants go about their daily business. The colossal 
shape of Mount Mindolluin is always present to the south-west, as 
are the White Mountains that stretch out further beyond it. 
   The road of Lond Anorien leads from north to south a short

Passing Countryside upon Lond Anorien~
   On either side of the great road here lie the fields of 
Anorien, grassy, fallow fields running between land set aside for 
crops and that for livestock. The road itself is wide enough to 
bear a pair of wagons side by side, and the grass at the side of 
its mostly-white cobblestones lies flattened and trampled. 
People wander by occasionally, some on foot, others mounted or 
riding in carriages or trade wagons. The occasional presence of 
armed guardsmen reinforce the security offered upon the highway 
through northern Gondor. 
   The compass points of north and south see the white road 
continue its path through the fields that lies on either side of 
it.

East of Lond Anorien~
   In the distance to the south-west, no matter where one stands 
here, the towering peak of Mount Mindolluin and the White 
Mountains that stretch out beyond it is always visible, capped 
with snow and often cloaked in mist. Through this area grassy 
fallow fields and small hillocks vie for space between rows of 
planted crops and grazing livestock, the situation repeated 
throughout the lands of Anorien in Northern Gondor. A light 
copse of woodland can be seen to north, the slender Heledhnen 
tributary flowing behind it. 
   The grass thins out as it approaches a road to the west. Two 
short and broad columns of dressed granite stand on either side 
of the beginning of a partly graveled road that leads toward a 
high fence surrounding a cluster of buildings set amidst the 
fields.

of this area as well as the charred remnants of a low stone

Lond Anorien Leads North and South~
   Coursing its way through the vast countryside of Anorien, the 
northernmost province of Gondor, this road keeps for the most 
part a straight course. Small villages and hamlets, cultivated 
fields, herds of livestock and the occasional keep and bastion 
are all passed by the road at sporadic intervals. Grainy white 
stone makes up most of the path, wide enough to bear two 
carriges, yet grey and black stones are not uncommon, and every 
now and again a pothole can be seen in the road. 
   South the road runs straight, while to the north it slowly 
curves to cut west through the fields. A copse of woodland, and 
a bastion tower, are visible in the distance to the north-east.

Tended Lands of the Anorien Countryside~
   While not overly so, the lands of Anorien are fertile enough 
to provide a decent livelihood to the farmers that tend to the 
land and their livestock upon it. Bordered to the north by the 
Heledhnen and to the east by the wide River Anduin, this portion 
of the countryside of Northern Gondor is peaceful at most times 
as its inhabitants go about their daily business. The colossal 
shape of Mount Mindolluin is always present to the south-west, as 
are the White Mountains that stretch out further beyond it. 
   A small, log cabin can be seen in a clearing of trees.

Fields Approaching the Walls of a Ruined City to the East~
   A rustic atmosphere lies settled over the countryside of 
Anorien, those lands west of the River Anduin and north of the 
cathedral Minas Tirith. The labours of agriculture spread out 
for the eye to see, farmers caring for to their crops and 
shepherds managing their herds during the day and at night the 
villages and farmsteads that dot the land casting out points of 
light in the distance. A few travellers can be seen moving 
through the tended lands rather then walk upon the more crowded 
highways that cut through Anorien. The farmlands and fields end 
to the east as the walls of the city rise upwards. Some charred 
wood litters the ground here, the grass around it blackened in a 
rough square.

Atop the Amon Theyrn Near a Farmstead~
   A small path runs up the hill to a square grassy yard of this 
farmstead to the north. A cottage can be seen set on the west 
side of the yard, opposite a large barn. The Pelennor Fields 
stretch away in all other directions, except to the east where a 
high, sturdy fence encloses a paddock. Stables can be seen at 
the far side. The view from the top of this hill is impressive, 
the white peaks of Mindolluin and the pale walls of Minas Tirith 
rising westwards. In all other directions the rising wall of the 
Rammas Echor is clear to see on most days. 
   A large oaken gate stands open here much of the time. It is 
slatted with heavy oaken panels and set into massive iron hinges 
on a thick log stake. A wide high arch stands ready for the gate 
to bar access. A ledge is mounted to the arch, bearing an 
engraving of a hawk with wings backswept in flight, soaring 
upwards. The image of a perfectly formed dove rests in fine 
detail upon its chest, near its heart.

Inside a Stone-Flag Floored Cottage~
   With dark varnished eaves and a stone flag floor that reflects 
light, this room is clean and quiet. A proud hearth stands at 
the corner nearest a southern door and a heavy drape reveals a 
cosy kitchen to the north. A small window set in the eastern 
wall next to the door looks out to a yard. A new door sits in 
the western wall, obviously not part of the original

A Yard Before the Cottage~
   Set for the use of the small farmstead, this yard is obviously 
cleaned and tended regularly. Grass covers the ground like a 
carpet, and has been kept short. A barn stands to the east, 
while a small shed sits on the northern side. A knee high fence 
of rough stones borders the square yard, and a painted door leads 
west into the cottage. To the north a path leads along the 
eastern edge of the cottage towards a gate and copse beyond. To 
the south a high oak and birch fence reveals an enclosed paddock 
and a trail leading away to the Pelennor fields down the hillock. 
Lanterns hang off hooks against the wall of the cottage, barn and 
shed, keeping this place well lit during the night.

Rolling Fields Between Mindolluin and Lond Anorien~
   Bordered to the north by the Heledhnen tributary, and to the 
west by the bulwark of Mindolluin, this stretch of the 
countryside of Northern Gondor is peaceful at most times as its 
inhabitants go about their daily business. The colossal shape of 
Mount Mindolluin is always present to the south and west, as are 
the White Mountains that stretch out further beyond it. Through 
this area grassy fallow fields and small hillocks vie for space 
between rows of planted crops and grazing livestock, the 
situation repeated throughout the lands of Anorien in Northern 
Gondor.

At a Bend in the Lond Anorien~
   On either side of the great road here lay the fields of 
Anorien, grassy, fallow fields running between land set aside for 
crops and that for livestock. The road itself is wide enough to 
bear a pair of wagons side by side to run up it and the grass at 
the side of its mostly-white cobblestones lays flattened and 
trampled. People wander by occasionally, some on foot, others 
mounted or riding in carriages or trade wagons. The occasional 
presence of armed guardsmen reinforce the security offered upon 
the highway through northern Gondor. 
   The road curves from east to north here, the craggy face of 
Mindolluin rising above the landscape in the former direction.

Lond Anorien Turns South and West~
   An occasional wagon or traveller passes by on the 
white-cobbled road here as well as patrols of guardsmen from some 
of the townships in the countryside in northern Gondor. To the 
south and west the gigantic, winding chain that is the White 
Mountains stretches from over the horizon to the west, ending at 
a large peak far to the south. Fields stretch out from the road, 
some tended by the hands of man, the mouth of cattle or sheep, or 
left fallow, while the road leads on oblivious to them all. 
   Very gradually, the road turns from west to south here before 
meandering northward again through the landscape. A small dirt 
trail leads off east to the base of a squat stone bastion.

Along the Lond Anorien, Running South to North~
   The highway known as the Lond Anorien courses north to south 
here, its interlocking, weathered white cobbles cutting a sharp 
path through the gently undulating countryside of Anorien. 
Grasses and other hardy vegetation poke through the gaps in the 
pattern of the roadway, its surface worn from use, but otherwise 
well maintained. To the west stretch the cultivated fields of 
the fiefdom, which come to end at the base of the lofty Mount 
Mindolluin and the surrounding mountains, their snow-capped peaks 
visible in the distance. To the northeast the beginnings of a 
birch woodland can be seen - a line of colour marking the 
horizon. 
   The road continues its straight course from north to south, 
but angles away to the east as it continues in the latter 
direction.

On a Small Hillock, Near the Bend in a Highway~
   In the fiefdom of Anorien, a complacent peace and calm hold 
over the many small towns and isolated farms that dot the 
landscape of fields and gentle green hills. The regular patrol 
of soldiers belonging to the local lords of the land upon the 
roads and highways that cut through Northern Gondor ensures that 
no harm can come to the valuable agricultural land of the mighty 
country. To the west, the countryside expands onwards for 
hundreds of miles, unhindered by anything, while the tributary of 
Heledhnen and the River Anduin act as the northern and eastern 
borders of this section of Anorien. 
   The small hillock here gives a clear vantage of the highway of 
Lond Anorien that lies to the south and west. Atop the hillock 
signs of pyres litter the large flat stones.

intertwined with snake-like vines, is substantial enough to hide

Dense Birch Woods~
   A thick canopy of boughs and other smaller branches of the 
tall birch trees here has been woven between the many mature 
trees that sprout up from the ground here. The quiet rustlings 
and scampering movements of small forest creatures can be heard 
occasionally in this woodland, the dense layer of smaller plants 
and trees around the feet providing cover against larger

East of a Birch Woodland~
   In the fiefdom of Anorien, a complacent peace and calm hold 
over the many small towns and isolated farms that dot the 
landscape of fields and gentle green hills. The regular patrol 
of soldiers belonging to the local lords of the land upon the 
roads and highways that cut through Northern Gondor ensures that 
no harm can come to the valuable agricultural land of the mighty 
country. To the west, the countryside expands onwards for 
hundreds of miles, unhindered by anything, while the Heledhnen 
tributary acts as the northern border of this section of Anorien. 
    A cabin is set in the distant tree line to the west.

Healthy Anorien Countryside~
   While not overly so, the lands of Anorien are fertile enough 
to provide a decent livelihood to the farmers that tend to the 
land and their livestock upon it. Bordered to the north by the 
Heledhnen and to the east by the wide River Anduin, this portion 
of the countryside of Northern Gondor is peaceful at most times 
as its inhabitants go about their daily business. The colossal 
shape of Mount Mindolluin is always present to the south-west, as 
are the White Mountains that stretch out further beyond it. 
   To the north and east the shores of the Heledhnen tributary 
and the River Anduin signal a halt to the progression of the 
Anorien farmlands.

Lond Anorien, Between Fields~
   A long highway of white cobbles, greying a little with age, 
stretches forth here in a straight line. The occasional 
traveller can be seen traversing its length, or departing into 
the fields, crossed with paths, that border it to the east and 
west. Birch trees encroach upon the roadway to the northeast, 
their knotted roots uplifting the rectangular stones of the 
highway, making travel in that direction bumpy and uneven. To 
the west a line of foothills can be seen bordering the fields of 
Anorien, rising up to meet the sheer face of Mindolluin and other 
outlying mountains of the range. 
   The road continues north and south as far as the eye can see, 
and a farmhouse stands here, appearing to be fairly new to the 
area.

Tended Pastures West of a Birch Forest~
   In the distance to the south-west, no matter where one stands 
here, the towering peak of Mount Mindolluin and the White 
Mountains that stretch out beyond it is always visible, capped 
with snow and often cloaked in mist. Through this area grassy 
fallow fields and small hillocks vie for space between rows of 
planted crops and grazing livestock, the situation repeated 
throughout the lands of Anorien in Northern Gondor. A light 
copse of woodland can be seen to north, the slender Heledhnen 
tributary flowing behind it. 
   The vegetation of the fallow field here quickly intensifies as 
it approaches the birch forest to the east. The land dips down 
to the west, where it meets the border of a broad, white-cobbled 
road.

Dense Birch Woodland~
   Numerous birch trees rise up high overhead here, forcing those 
who travel through this area to negotiate over the large roots 
and felled trees. Moss and other lichen grow at the base of the 
trees, whilst upward along their trunks sits the silver bark of 
the birch, feeling smooth to the touch. Green toothed leaves 
hang from the drooping branches of the trees here, some 
interwoven in a woodland canopy. 
   To the south and west the birch trees quickly thin out before 
the open countryside of Anorien while nearby, a small path leads 
to a tall heavy fenced enclosure.

larger birches intertwine their leafless branches into one 
extensive canopy. Young birch saplings grow in the shadows of 
their uncles and parents and amidst the sparse undergrowth, 
composed of wild snake-like wines and several year-round bushes. 
   In all directions the woodlands seem to continue, but with the 
snow and blizzard it is hard to be certain.

A Thick Copse of Trees~
   Tall pines stretch their boughs to the sky along with a great 
many other variety, on this small hillock where the retreating 
birch woods seems to have given way. The evergreen needles 
shield away most of Anor's light leaving the area with a green 
tint in daylight. A thick growth of small shrubs and plants 
crowds around the trees, slowing movement through this area. 
   In all directions the forest continues on, but a cabin can be 
seen under the cover of the canopy.

On the Lond Anorien, Hemmed in by Birch Woodland~
   Cutting its way through sparse birch woodland and a thicket of 
other vegetation, this road keeps for the most part to a straight 
course. Small villages and hamlets, cultivated fields, herds of 
livestock and the occasional keep and bastion are all passed by 
the road at sporadic intervals. Grainy white stone makes up most 
of the path, wide enough to bear two carriages, yet grey and black 
stones are not uncommon, and every now and again a pothole can be 
seen in the road. 
   To the north the road presses on through more sparse woodland, 
while to the south it carries on through clear fields.

Lond Anorien, Bordered by Sparse Woodland~
   A sparse collection of birch trees rise up high overhead here, 
shading this stretch of the highway known as Lond Anorien. Moss 
and other lichen grow at the base of the trees encroaching 
nearby, whilst upward along their trunks sits the silver bark of 
the birch. Leaves often blanket the roadway during the autumn, 
falling from the boughs that loom nearby. The road dips and 
rises here with the roll of the landscape, flattening to the 
north and south. 
   As it continues northward, the highway bends westward, closer 
to the foothills of Mindolluin that can be seen in the distance.

   The extensive blanket of white snow matches the dirty-white 
birch trees that dominate this part of the forest. Several 
larger birches intertwine their leafless branches into one 
extensive canopy. Young birch saplings grow in the shadows of 
their uncles and parents and amidst the sparse undergrowth, 
composed of wild snake-like vines and evergreen bushes.
   In all directions the woodlands seem to continue, but with the 
snow and blizzard it is hard to be certain.

Birch Woods with Thick Undergrowth, Encroaching Upon a Road~
   Tall birch trees with smooth, silver bark clamber up towards 
the sky here, their drooping branches interwoven so thickly that 
during the day light from the sun must filter past the small, 
green, edged leaves. A thick undergrowth of various shrubs and 
plants, as well as younger birch saplings, crowds around the base 
of the wide trunks of the birches, slowing movement through this 
area. 
   In all directions of the compass point the woods continues 
without halt, save to the west, where the fringe of the woodland 
is divided by a straight cobbled road.

Thick, Birch-Tree Woods~
   Birch trees heavily populate this patch of woods. Older, more 
dominating birches spread their expansive canopies over the 
younger, struggling saplings. While not thick enough to impede 
travel, the encompassing undergrowth, composed of varied bushes 
intertwined with snake-like vines, is substantial enough to hide 
the multitudes of wild critters that make it their home. 
   To all points of the compass the woodland continues over the 
thick undergrowth.

A Well-Logged Area Approaching the Shore of the Heledhnen~
   The thick canopy of boughs and other smaller branches of the 
tall birch trees visible to the west are extremely sparse here. 
The area is strewn with the stumps of many trees, a scar to the 
beauty of the woodlands. A few forest creatures scamper through 
the thin underbrush, though the majority of the fauna is made up 
of the birds that inhabit the few trees here. 
   To the north and east the shore of a glassy tributary quickly 
becomes visible, while in all other directions the forest 
continues.

Extensive Countryside of Anorien by a Bend in the Lond Anorien ~
   A rustic atmosphere lies settled over the countryside of 
Anorien, those lands west of the River Anduin and north of the 
cathedral Minas Tirith. The labours of agriculture spread out 
for the eye to see, farmers caring for their crops and shepherds 
managing their herds during the day and at night the villages and 
farmsteads that dot the land casting out points of light in the 
distance. A few travellers can be seen moving through the tended 
lands rather then walk upon the more crowded highways that cut 
through Anorien. 
   To the north and east the countryside is bordered by a broad, 
white-cobbled road, while it continues to the south, and to the 
west where it eventually meets the base of the foothills of 
Mindolluin. A farmhouse is here amidst some fields and pasture.

Along the Lond Anorien, Nearing a Birch Wood~
   The highway of Lond Anorien stretches here from north to 
south, cutting a sweeping course through the fields and hillocks 
of the Gondorian fiefdom that bears the same name. At the center 
of this stretch of the highway the road rises significantly with 
the rolling landscape. From that higher vantage, the surrounding 
features of the countryside can clearly be seen - to the east 
lies the edge of a birch forest, the nearest fringes well logged 
and showing the beginnings of cultivation, while to the northwest 
runs the clear tributary known as Heledhnen, a small township on 
its banks. 
   The road continues to the south, where it cuts through sparse 
birch woodland, and to the north where it bends westward as it 
meets the Heledhnen.

Well-logged Woodland East of a Road~
   Numerous stumps here attest that this part of the forest has 
been well-plundered of trees for now. Those who wish to travel 
here must navigate all the felled trees, stumps, and roots still 
buried half in the ground. Moss and lichen grow at the base of 
the trees, while the few trees remaining catch the sunlight and 
dapple it to the ground. 
   To the west the forest quickly thins out, reaching a road that 
cuts through a fallow field in the landscape of Northern Gondor. 
Northwards the woods continue right to the shore of the Heledhnen 
tributary.

Low Roofed Guard House~
   The walls made from a white, grainy stone, this room is rather 
large and spartanly furnished. Designed to house those members 
of the Minas Tirith Highway Garrison, this room makes up the base 
floor of the small tower that climbs up to meet the walls of the 
Rammas Echor. The pine-paneled roof distances itself roughly six 
feet away from the similarily constructed floor, and in the 
north-east corner of the room a narrow staircase leads up to the 
second level. 
   A thick oak door opens outwards to the Lond Forodren-Rhunen to

aesthetic quality. Two arches lead out from the tower, cut from

the other two walls. A oak trap-door has been set in the floor

out into the River Anduin that flows by. Northwards the road

   A pair of wagon tracks, aided by the footfall of many a boot 
over the years, has formed a rough dirt trail here that leads to 
the east and west. Bordering the trail a short distance covered

about to partake in a voyage. The occasional hawker shouts out 
of their ware of fish or bait, wandering through the wooden 
platform of Harlond Docks suspended above the water. 
   Two docks lead off here to the south and east, while Harlond 
Docks continue to the west. A dirt trail runs between the shore

this short wharf off Harlond Docks. Signs of rot in the wood can 
be seen on the edges of the planks that have been laid across to 
form the platform above the water here, and the smell of fish 
innards is strong. Few people make their way through this 
rickety, unmaintained wharf, yet still a few boats will tie up to 
it as well as fishermen seeking a spot unshared with others.

Just Above the Anduin River on a Rickety, Unmaintained Wharf~
   Few if any people come down here during the light of day, even 
less under the rule of night. The boards and planks used to 
create this platform are mossy, and the occasional barnacle is 
present upon them. Six great oak beams rise up above the head of 
a man here as they support the slightly more sturdier wharf 
above. In high tides the waters of the River Anduin skim over 
the platform here, making it even slipperier. 
   A set of crude stairs, a number missing, leads upwards to the 
wharf in proper.

Lamplit Wharf~
   This wharf is markedly different from others the branch off 
Harland Docks, that being that on either side of its broad 
platform cast-iron lamps run the length of the construction. The 
river boats and barges that stop at this wharf are usually of 
slightly better design and construct, and some bear the symbol of 
the Tree of Gondor, marking them as vessels of the Ruling Steward 
of the land. 
   The lamplit wharf continues to the south over the waters of

Harlond Docks South of a Warehouse~
   Sea gulls swoop through the air above the docks here, 
sometimes darting down in a pack to fight over the discarded 
remains of a catch from one of the many fishermen that sit on the 
edge of the oak platform above the waters of the River Anduin. 
River trade is alive and well in Harlond Docks as boats from up 
and down the vast river that lies to the east, west and south 
drop off and take goods from these docks. A row of iron-cast 
lamp posts runs along the northern edge of the docks, before the 
buildings present there. 
   A large warehouse lies to the north, taking in goods freshly 
delivered from the wharves of Harlond Docks. The wooden platform 
continues to the east and west.

The Wooden Platforms of Harlond Docks~
   The wooden platform that bears Harlond Docks above the waters 
of the River Anduin creaks and groans under the feet of the 
numerous people that move to and fro along its treated surface. 
A row of mismatched buildings lies on the north side of the 
docks, constructed mainly from cedar, fine oak and pine woods, 
while to the south a number of wharves, jetties and piers stretch 
out for the mooring of river vessels and also the haunt of 
numerous fishermen seeking meals for the day. 
   Harlond Docks continue to the east and west, while a broad 
wharf stretches out to the south. The office of the Dock Master 
lies in a squat building to the north.

Broad Wharf off Harlond Docks~
   Looking well maintained, this wharf has been built with the 
purpose of easily allowing many river boats and other inland 
vessels to moor up to it and unload as possible. Numerous ships 
do so now, porters and sailors helping load or unload cargo to 
place on the treated oak boards of the wharf. The noise of 
shouting merchants combined with the lapping waters of the River 
Anduin is a constant presence here. 
   To the north lies the platform of Harland Docks, while 
southwards the wharf continues. 

To the south, part of the docks have been burned away, with a 
couple of ships and boats having sank below the water.

Broad Wharf Over the River Anduin~
   A constant bustle of activity is present on this wharf during 
the daytime, with merchants overseeing the movement of cargo to 
and from the wharf onto and outof the numerous river boats and 
barges that are moored to this wharf at any one time. At night 
it slows to a crawl of the odd boat pulling up or a lone night 
fisherman seeking to lure fish under the cover of darkness. The 
waters of the River Anduin are dark in colour here as they lap 
around the beams that support the wharf. 
   In all directions, save to the north where the wharf leads 
back to the docks the water of the river flows.

West End of Harlond Docks~
Oak slates have been laid upon large cross-running beams in 
turn supported by large oak pillars secured deep in the shallows 
of the River Anduin, and in doing so, forming Harlond Docks. The 
wooden platform is busy both during day and night, river boats 
arriving to the wharves from the fast flowing waters of the river 
which lies to the south and east. All kinds of people mill about 
here, some porters and merchants checking over boats, others 
natives to Harlond Docks and making their way in and out the row 
of wooden buildings that run north along the docks.

A small pier frequented by fishermen lies to the west and to the 
north a stone-paved road begins, leading north to a great wall in 
the distance. Harlond Docks continue to the east.

A naval vessel carries soldiers and materiel between the various 
military docks and Harlond.

Stone Road Leading South to Harlond Docks~
   As the stone-paved road leads south here, the hardened earth 
of the shoreline ends, yet instead of the waters of the River 
Anduin the begining of the Harlond Docks lie, an oak platform 
supported by numerous thick wooden beams. The sound of gulls 
screech through the air at all times of day as they soar 
overhead. Rambling up and down the road are merchants, traders 
and sailors all going to business on the docks with regards to 
sending or recieving goods to and from the river trade between 
here and other cities of Gondor. 
   To the east a large cedar-building stands, a sign displaying a 
river-boat sailing along rough waters hanging from a cast-iron 
pole jutting out over the door.

Stone Paved Road Leading North and South~
   Laid down upon the sparsely grass-covered shore of the River 
Anduin, a road composed of grey cobblestones leads downhill to 
the south to the wooden platforms of Harlond Docks, while north 
to the base of a gate of the Rammas Echor. A slight stream of 
people and goods constantly move from north to south, bringing 
goods into the white stone walls or down to be loaded onto river 
ships to cast off out onto the River Anduin which snakes from the 
south-west to the west around the docks. 
   A smaller, dirt trail joins the paved road here from the east, 
leading around a collection of wooden buildings at the base of 
the walls that lead around to the north-east.

Short Pier~
   This pier has been constructed outwards from the main platform 
of Harlond Docks which lies to the east. Four pairs of narrow 
oak-wood beams support the wooden construction as it heads out a 
small distance west into deeper waters of the River Anduin, a 
prime fishing spot. A number of people have chosen it as such, 
and sit by the side of the pier holding fishing rods and with 
their lines in the water. The occasional small dinghy moors up 
to the side of the pier, but for the most part there is little 
traffic through here save a fisherman starting or finishing a 
day's work.

Dock Master's Office~
   This spacious room has been constructed of timber planks, the 
roof sloping upward to a centre point. A coat of thick white 
paint has been laid down, still appearing fresh and a fairly 
strong of the colour. People gather in here both day and night, 
waiting upon the Dockmaster of Harlond Docks, checking in and out 
their vessels and declaring their cargo. There is little 
furniture in the office to offer comfort to those that wait here, 
and a thick oak door lies in the southern wall.

Busy Warehouse~
   Wide-set walls hold in them a large number of goods and items, 
piles of crates, sacks, boxes and bundles all organized in an 
orderly manner but covering most of the floor. All through the 
day and night the workers of the warehouse as well as porters and 
other such men take and deposit, adding and subtracting to 
everything stored here in order to keep Harlond Docks free from 
any great encumbrances. Lanterns cast a warm light over the room 
and its goods both day and night, and a set of wide doors leads 
out of the warehouse to the south.

The River Rat Tavern~
   Earning its name as a stopping point for the men and women who 
live their lives out on the River Anduin for travel and trade, 
the common room of the tavern holds with it a bawdy and loud 
atmosphere. A small stone hearth lies against the southern wall 
for use in the chill of winter, and a dozen or so tables crowd 
the floor in the centre of the room. The ale flows easily, and 
chatter, brawls, underhand deals and drinking continues both 
night and day under the light provided from the lamps hanging 
from the cross beams that run under the high roof.

Fisherman's Stall~
   This stall has been erected upon a patch of grassy dirt, a red 
and white striped piece of canvas sheltering it from the fall of 
rain and the touch of the sun. Several wooden benches lay about, 
displaying goods such as fishing nets and rods, as well as other 
items such as fish hooks. A light trickle of people pass through 
here, most of them veteran fishers coming for new pieces to ply 
their livelihood. 
   A dirt trail runs by the stall to the east.

A Narrow Hallway~
   Large enough for a few people to pass down the steps side by 
side and walk easily to the rooms, this hallway stretches its 
rectangular shape to the east and west. Floored in polished 
wooden planks, the stairway leading into the commons has been 
overplaced with a simple canvas rug. A few lanterns hang evenly 
from the walls at certain points, lit each night by the keeper of 
this establishment. 
   A wooden stairway leads into the Wardog's Common, while a 
simple coloured square is painted over each door: green upon the 
north, white upon the east, purple upon the south, and blue upon 
the west.

A Large Purple Suite~
   Streaming in light in the daytime, a circular stained-glass 
window depicting a shield has been inset into the eastern wall. 
Each of the four walls have been painted a deep purple, 
contrasting the whitewashed ceiling in color and depth. The 
floor has been carpeted in a lavender carpet, running to meet 
with polished, birchwood molding. A whitewashed wooden door 
stands just to the east, offering an exit into the inn's hallway.

Blue Room~
   Painted a light, airy blue, the four walls enclose a moderatly 
sized bedchamber. A small window opens out from the southern 
wall, offering natural daylight to stream into the room. Ornate, 
silver candle holders handle tall, white wax candles providing 
light for the eyes after nightfall. Covering the floor, a deep 
blue rug sits just a few feet from the baseboards of the wall, 
showing off a polished cedar floor. 
   A door stands just to the north.

A Small White Room~
   Small, mostly clean, and kept neat, this small square room 
services as a bedroom. Windowless, it relys on a simple brass 
lantern near the wooden door to keep back the darkness, and allow 
vision to work no matter the time. Smooth, unpolished pine makes 
up the floorboards that run to the whitewashed walls.

Narrow Cloakroom~
   Narrow and cramped, this small room is lined with small hooks. 
As patrons come and go, they hang their cloaks upon the hooks, 
removing some of the weight from their travels. Walled in wooden 
planks, the floor has been crafted of a white stone, more often 
then not, tracked over with mud and other refuse. One small 
brass lantern hangs above the northern, and southern doors. 
   South, a heavy brown curtain holds out some of the laughter 
and chatter from the commons. North and east, a heavy wooden 
door prevents any further travel in either direction.

A Small Kitchen~
   The southern wall of this room is dominated by a massive, 
stone hearth that emanates light, and a fair bit of heat. A few 
workers make their way to their tasks, pushing past anyone 
entering in their haste. Small and cramped, this room serves as 
a kitchen and workarea, dishes and empty tankards sprawled over 
counters and shelves. In the later hours of the night, voices 
can be heard from the west, chattering and gossiping out in the 
common. 
   A newly build small staircase leads into a storage room a few 
feet above the kitchen on the eastern wall.

Horseyard~
   Dirty and well-used, this fenced-in yard sits just off to the 
east of the Lond Forodren-Annui. Patrons to the inn ride in on 
horseback here, offering their mounts a stable for their stay. 
Piles of hay let off a musty scent, mingling with the smells of 
horses and manure. A large, two-storied building stands just to 
the south. To the south, a wooden sign has been hung over a 
heavy wooden door, depicting a black helm.

Low Cairn In the Earth~
   Cut away from the dirt of the earth in a rough fashion, the 
ceiling of this cairn is low enough so that it forces all but the 
shortest of people to hunch over. Loose dirt and stones cover 
the floor, the air in this cavern dank and musty. Cobwebs run 
over every flat surface here, their inhabitants equally present. 
To the north, east, south and west the cave runs off into 
singular tunnels, while in the centre of the roof here a narrow 
tunnel lies, just wide enough for one determined to do so to pull 
themselves through.

Hand Dug Alcove~
   This narrow alcove has been dug by hand through the dark earth 
here. The ceiling is rather low to the floor, and running along 
it are many tree roots as well as the pale tendrils of other 
plants. The warm light of the sun fails to reach this area of 
the cairn, bringing a chill to it not found on the surface. 
Scattered upon the floor are numerous loose stones, as well as a 
veritable carpet of cobwebs. Little chambers have been cut into 
the walls to the east and west, yellowed bones placed disorderly 
upon them. On the bottom rack of the western wall is a pile of 
protruding bones, several have fallen out of the chamber as if 
forced from their resting place.

Squat Dirt Chamber~
   Moderately sized rocks, a slate grey in colour, show through 
the earth walls and ceiling of this squat chamber. Large enough 
so that perhaps four humans could just squeeze in here hunched 
over, the chamber looks to have been created with hands alone or 
simply wooden tools that have cut straight away at the dirt. As 
such, much loose dirt has accumulated upon the floor over the 
years, deposited by the occasional trickle of grains from the 
roof that occur periodically.

Gloomy Cairn~
   Cut into the earth walls of this cairn are small chambers 
designed to house bodies of the deceased. Few reside now in 
them, cobwebs stretching throughout most of the chambers, but the 
occasional yellowed bone or ancient shard of rusted metal can be 
seen. The low ceiling of this section of the cairn forces most 
people to bend their backs to make progress. The air is still, 
stuffy and difficult to breathe, and the lack of natural light 
casts the area into an atmosphere of gloom.

Dank Cave~
   The air is this branch of the cairn is dank, a drip of water 
falling from the earthen ceiling in a small depression filled 
with muddy water. No natural light falls any within the dirt 
wall boundaries of this cave, yet plant and tree roots branch 
down, running through the roof. There is no sign of any 
inhabitants of the cairn in this section, the small earth cavern 
holding a lonely atmosphere to it. The only direction allowing 
movement of any sorts is to the east where this tunnel rejoins 
the centre of the cairn.

Common Room at the Ground Floor of the Bastion~
   A cosy, comfortable atmosphere hangs over the common room that 
takes up most of the ground floor of the bastion. A small stone 
hearth has been set at the eastern wall, radiating warmth 
throughout the colder months of the years, a small pile of 
firewood set beside it ready to be fed to the flames. The 
occasional lounging figure can be seen here, sitting at one of 
the numerous chairs or tables set upon the floor. The walls are 
made of a grainy white stone, with a stout oak door set in the 
western wall. A stone stairwell leads upward to the second floor 
of the bastion.

A Comfortable Lounge~
   Recently refurbished, this room has been laid out as a 
comfortable area, seemingly designed for relaxation and quiet 
conversation. The regular, white stone that makes up the walls 
offers no exits but the southern and eastern walls bear an arrow 
slit that offers a view of the road below. Wooden timbers make 
up the roof and floor here, in the north west corner a staircase 
runs up and down through them both. A small room with stone 
walls is set in the north east corner, a solid door set in its 
southern wall, while something resembling a closet door opens up 
to the south.

Cosy Kitchen~
   Although the space allocated to this kitchen entrusted with 
cooking and preparing meals for the Lord's wardens and squires is 
far from large, it has been well organized and maintained. White 
stone walls rise up in all directions, and a small archway with a 
blue curtain draped over it has been cut into the southern wall. 
In the north east corner a small clear space from the racks, 
shelves and cupboards of the kitchen holds a trapdoor.

Compact Armoury~
   The small space offered by this storage room has been put to 
the best of its use, chests and weapon racks going under 
multi-layered shelves all under the constant light of a lamp 
hanging from the centre of the ceiling here. Meeting here are 
the faint aroma of wet leather and the hint of lamp oil, yet the 
smell is not repugnant, merely curious to the nose. Set in the 
south wall is a stout oak door. 
   A newly built stout door is set into the northern wall
here.

Crenulated Towertop~
   The vast countryside of Anorien can be seen with an excellent 
view from up here on the tower top. Northwards a forest of birch 
trees can be seen spreading out to the banks of the River Anduin 
which cuts through the landscape from the west to the south east. 
A city and a fortified island are visible to the east, while in 
all other directions the farmlands of Northern Gondor is present 
for the wandering eye to view. The bastion has been made of 
white limestone, and this crenulated top is lit at night by four 
large iron braziers. A trap door set in the middle of the tower 
leads down to inside of the bastion.

Cool Cellar~
   Stretching underneath the entire bastion, this cellar is as a 
result rather large. The white stone walls that have been cut 
into the earth keep the cool feel to the air here, but damp and 
mould are lacking in order to keep provisions stored down here in 
untouched conditions. Shelves, racks and chests bear in them 
many long-term foods and barrels of liquid, but some fresher food 
as well as raw ingredients can be seen in their own location. 
Through the wooden timber ceiling of the cellar the faint sound 
of voices can be made out, and set in the north-east corner is a 
small staircase leading out.

A Crudely-Built Treehouse~
   Of modest size and poor construction, this shack has been 
nestled onto a platform built onto the branches of an old birch 
tree. Though seemingly stable for the most part, unsettling 
shifts and shudders still frequently occur in high winds. The 
thatched roof overhead is sufficient to keep most of elements 
away, yet several spots are notably unprotected, while the 
recently reconstructed flooring provides an adequate base. Near 
the edge, a hole allows access to and from the ground.

Winding Path to the Mines and Quarry~
   This path winds upward through the mountainous terrain at a 
manageable slope, the ground littered with gravel and rock shards 
of a generally light gray and brown hue. Here and there, a few 
hardy plants sprout up, though many of them have been trampled. 
The sheer faces of the Mindolluin rise up hundreds of feet on 
either side, leaving a narrow strip of sky visible over their 
peaks. In the colder months, a chill wind whistles through this 
narrow channel. A tall, iron gatehouse blocks the way further up 
the mountain pass.

   A small fortification has been set up to guard the entrance to 
a quarry west of here. Consisting of little more than a pair of 
reinforced gates with a small stockade that seems to be built for 
keeping people in, rather than keeping them out. Opening up to 
the west is a large clearing, where the path comes to an end 
after rounding a final bend. The passage has been cleared of 
larger stones and boulders, which are now piled up on either 
side.

   Nearly frozen stone seems to cover most of this rocky quarry, 
making it difficult to mind one's steps over the jagged sheet 
rock. A log cabin has been constructed to the south, with what 
appears to be a large hunting horn mounted upon the roof. The 
doors to the cabin itself are thick and barred, the place clearly 
a fortified guardhouse of some form or another. The rocky shelf 
rise of the mountain blocks off any further travel south or 
potential escape.

work of miners heading in and out of the mineshaft that links up

remodeled, and fortified so that excavations deeper may continue

Rooftop Overlooking the Quarry~
   Unprotected from the often-harsh weather, the wood plankings 
that form this rooftop are eroded and have a tendency to creak 
under the weight of footsteps. A simple, wooden railing 
encircles the perimeter, providing limited protection from 
falling. Nevertheless, this is an ideal vantage point for

provides entrance and exit.

   The interior of the house appears to be fresher and more 
recently cared for than the exterior. On the northeast side
of this room a staircase rises through the ceiling. During the
day, light streams through a pair of windows on the southern
wall, accentuating the nicely-finished wood-planked floor of
the room. The walls have been white-washed, though some of its
age still shows through. Doors are set in the south and west
walls, the south one flanked by windows.

This pine staircase leads up to the next floor. Well-crafted, a
wooden rail runs along the side of the stairs, its surface sanded
to prevent splinters and white-washed to match the surrounding
walls. At the top of the staircase is a small landing, a door set
in one side.

A Dusty Path Between a Field and a Small Barn~
   This dirt path leads past a small garden. The garden is far
from large, but sufficient for planting. East of the garden, the
path turns north before a small barn toward a fenced-off field.
To the east stands the barn, of fairly recent construction by
the look of it. To the west, the path continues on toward a
house. Directly to the northwest is a small house while the path
continues toward a gate. The house appears a bit weathered
by the elements, the horizontal wood panelling bearing numerous
cracks and chinks, except for the central room of the house
that appears to have been built recently. A pair of chipped
shutters cover a small window in this newer section. A large
heavily reinforced oak door with metal bands on it provides the 
only visible access to the house.

A Compact, Poorly-Kept Storefront~
   This wood planked storefront is quite small and is only able 
to manage a rather small number of occupants among its cluttered 
walls and used floor space. Various mining tools hang along the 
walls, and several large metal bins serve as displays of iron and 
copper ore, as well as moonstones. The rough, stone floor is 
covered in pieces of scrap metal and rock debris, with a door set 
in the north and south ends. An old brass lantern hangs from one 
of the wooden pillars that hold up this stores roof.

A Path in Between a Log Cabin and a Quarry~
   A short path leads towards a wooden guardhouse which has been 
set up on the south side of the quarry. A fortification has been 
set up on top of the cabin which can be seen from below. Upon a 
high railing is large curved horn that could probably be heard 
from a great distance. Snipers could also be positioned on the 
roof in the case of an uprising. The door south into that cabin 
has been fairly heavily reinforced to protect it against some 
degree of battering.

Inside a Wood-Planked, Iron-Barred Prison Coach~
   Solid wood planks make up the inside walls of this prison 
coach. The only bit of light that can be seen from inside the 
coach comes through the barred window slit at the back of the 
coach. A pair of benches and sturdy chains line the walls of the 
coach in order to keep the prisoners locked inside the coach 
firmly until a guard would come by and move them out.

The Base of an Old, Guard Tower~
   This base of this oddly furnished tower has clearly been 
turned into someone's common room. A heavy door with a large 
iron bar across it stands to the south clearly a new addition to 
the aging tower. A thick, dark green carpetextends all the way 
towards the fireplace where there is a brief area of marble 
paneling. A series of faded banners displaying the colors of 
Lord Astirian hang from the walls, a sword before a seven-pointed 
star set upon each of the leaf-green backgrounds. 
   A spiral staircase of carefully edged, solid stone leads up 
while a small archway beneath it leads to the kitchen.

A Earthen Basement~
   Thick, earthen walls make up this small basement though the 
floor has been tiled, likely some time ago. The whole room looks 
as if perhaps whatever was above it collapsed down below ground 
and has recently been reconstructed for some purpose. An 
occasional coffin or the odd torture device seems to be tossed 
down here as well as a bookshelf against one wall filled with old 
texts. The room opens out to the south to a much more recently 
constructed tunnel that is still roughly formed.

A Short Path Leading to an Ancient Guard Tower~
   A short path leads between a broken down guard tower and the 
quarry to the west. Heavy-door fortified with iron bars and 
obviously of new construction has been placed on the front of the 
tower. Heavy stones of basalt have been left behind showing 
where the tower had previously collapsed, though it is clear from 
the oddly colored stone which now covers the upper story of this 
structure that it is being remodeled currently to make it fit for 
use once more.

A Dusty, Heavily-Travelled Shopfront~
   Crates and bins line the walls of this shop, marked ingots for 
sale and crafted tools on display. The floorboards are worn from 
the many who have come through the shop, marking its obvious age 
and a thin layer of dust blown in from the nearby quarry forever 
settles upon everything. A counter has been constructed in the 
back of the shop, extending from one wall with nicks and marring 
in the old wood but still sturdy enough for use. 
   There are two doors to this shopfront, one leading west with a 
small window set in it, showing access inside the gate of the 
mines, and one south, leading out for the public usage to the 
winding trail outside. A small, discreet door sits behind the 
counter, leading further into the shop.

A Functional Sitting Room~
   This room is made of stone from ceiling to floor, allowing for 
coolness in the summer months and keeping in the warmth during 
the hotter seasons. It is bare, the only furnishings there meant 
solely for function and not style. From this room, a hallway 
branches eastwards and to the north, a sliding, wooden door leads 
out into the forge, visible from the small window cut into the 
wall.

A Cramped Kitchen~
   This room is rather cramped, the shelves linings its walls 
making it impossible to place anything against it and upon the 
other wall, a stove dominates most of the room, taking up one 
whole corner of the kitchen. Rather dangerously close to the 
stove is the large hearth made of white stones, constrasting with 
the dark grey of the building and being small, there is only 
enough room for the smallest of tables. Above the stove, a 
window is cut into the wall to allow fresh air in and a curtained 
archway leads south out of this room into the hallway while a 
tiny door leads out west into the forge outside.

   In the middle of this large, dirt yard is an awning that 
extends over the whole center of the area, leaving uncovered only 
the space around the buildings and the dirt path around the whole 
covered workspace. Under the awning, a massive, sweltering forge 
has been set up along with an anvil and racks hanging from the 
ceiling down for the placement of tools. The yard itself, where 
not bordered by building, is surrounded by the rock face of the 
mountain, sheltering the area from the worst of the elements.

far corners of the room. To illuminate the room, a small lantern 
has been attached to the wall beside the doorway otherwise there 
are no windows here, giving this storage shed a rather musty 
smell.

though not enough to illuminate it fully.

   This room is spacious enough to hold a few bunks without 
clutter though in itself is only of modest size. The stone 
floor, as in all other rooms, is bare, making it so that the 
littlest movement in the room can be heard. Rather than having a 
window in its wall, there is a cutout in the ceiling, shuttered 
with wood as a chain dangles down to allow one to open and close 
it, letting in sunlight into the room in the daytime or allowing 
a gaze of the skies in the evening.

A Short Tunnel with a Low Ceiling~
   Tight, uneven earthen walls restrict passage through here. 
Men could not fit here more then single file and there would be 
almost no room for one man to fight or kill another here. Tall 
men would have to crouch down when walking through to avoid being 
hit by the series of floorboards that goes overhead. This room 
is completely dark and it is difficult to avoid scraping oneself 
on the occasional sharp rock which juts out from the walls here.

   An occasional obviously-ancient display case showing proud

in this room to the south with a dark green shutter attached to 
it, showing that this area was actually once a turret of a tower 
rather than the bunk-lined dormitory that it serves as now. 
   In the middle of the room, a spiral staircase of stone allows 
passage further up into the tower or down into the common room.

in front of the heavy main door of the lodge. The road narrows 
to a path as it branches off to the east, running between 
fenced-off fields toward a large wooden structure. An orchard 
lies to the west, and beyond that the White Mountains rise up 
above the surrounding countryside. Parts of the porch here have 
been scarred by fire as has much of the land, other damage 
besides fire is also clearly evident.

A Large Kitchen~
   This square-shaped room is vast and desolate, the bulk of it 
bearing the burnt husk of a massive table and a dozen odd chairs. 
A large window is set into the south wall, and the eastern wall 
is lined with collasped shelves and cabinets. The walls, 
panneled with some sort of wood, have been exposed to some great 
heat, marking them with streaks of black and ash gray. Rotting 
black floorboards coat the ground, the weak material giving way 
to the slighest step. There is a wide gap in the south-eastern 
corner of the room where the floor has given in completely, a 
hole opened to the darkness below. The fireplace set in the 
middle of the north wall and the oven next to it have remained in 
tact, black in color naturally. A trap door is set in the floor 
between the dining and kitchen areas.

A Small Landing Atop The Stairs~
   This small landing is situated between two doorways: one to 
the east and one to the west. The eastern door has been cleaved 
through, the bottom half resting on the floor. The western door, 
though in tact, is stained with the dark fingerprints of fire. A 
small window is set in the southern wall, providing light and a 
view outside. The walls and floor are made of oak that has been 
eaten away over the years, blemished with burn mark. The stairs 
that once led down from the landing no longer serve their use and 
now serve as nothing more than a death trap without proper tools.

A Bunk-Lined Barracks~
   This medium-sized bedroom is panelled in rotten oak, the wood 
having taken on a smattering of white and ochre fungus. The 
floor likewise is made of ancient, soggy oak that emanates a 
rancor of decay. Most of the furniture that once stood proudly 
in this simple sleeping room has been cremated to ash, only a 
single table set in its center is left distinguishable. The hard 
wood table has been singed but more noticeably, it has been 
hacked in two.

A Bunk-Lined Barracks~
   Fire has entirely consumed this medium-sized room and dust has 
settled atop the leftovers. Its oak walls are bleak and rended, 
the great blaze once contained within cracking and slashing at 
the strong wood. Within these gashes small bits of life can be 
seen, tiny colonies of fungus plaguing even most minute hole. 
This gives the walls an uneasy white tint compared to the black 
remains scattered about the room.

An Overgrown Gravel Pathway~
   This path, once clear to see, has been completely lost to the 
wild grasses that grow about it. Having been neglected for years 
it has grown free and rises to mid-waist height. The wind blows 
through them freely from the pasture to the north, giving them 
movement. Hidden by the grass the gravel pathway runs east and 
west though all that remins of it is a few scattered patches. 
The stables to the east and the builing to the north-west have 
both seen some fire damage, the timbers used to make them charred 
and blackened in places.

A Fire Ravaged Field~
   This large pasture once a beautiful field has suffered, most 
of the field itself has been left to grow wild and free, 
resulting in waist-high grasses and hidden wildlife. To the east 
the burned husk of a barn remains, the nearby fields around it 
having been burned and scarred permanantly, lengths of 
part-charred timber lie where they fell. A gate to the south 
once provided a way in to the field but it has rotted and hangs 
loose on its rusted hinges.

   This large field is square in shape, bounded by a rotten fence 
on all four sides. Beyond the fence to the east and south lie 
more, while along the westernmost fence runs a road, to the north 
a path continues west just beyond the fence towards a decrepit 
house and east towards a similar looking stable. The grasses 
within have grown wild and untamed and little can be seen within 
it beyond a few paces. It seems to have suffered little compared 
to the rest of the area.

A Dusty Yard Before a Small Shack~
   A small shack and its outbuildings are settled along the side 
of a hillock in the fertile lands of the Anorien. The yard 
before the shack is barren and dusty. Not a blade of grass or 
other type of vegetation can be seen growing here. There are a 
myriad of small footprints which cover the ground, and beneath 
the dust the earth seems very well packed. 
   A small shack is directly to the south. Attached to the shack 
is a crude lean-to, which can be along the west side of the 
shack. A small gate leads into a fenced pen to the east.

   A low, split-log fence, perhaps on three feet high, encloses
three sides of this small animal pen.  It is perhaps twenty feet
square, and a steep, almost vertically rising hillside forms the
fourth wall.  The ground within the pen is very bare and dusty.
Not a blade of grass or a single weed grows within the confines
of the fenced space.  The earth is packed down very hard, and is
covered with thousands of little cloven-hoof prints.

   Once standing strong along the border of Mordor, this entryway 
into the destroyed keep is now in ruin. The gates along both 
sides are shattered and broken, only one still attached to its 
hinges, albeit barely. Some moss grows along the once stout 
stone walls, now cracked and broken. The ground is covered with 
broken weapons and armor, along with obvious bones of every size 
and shape, making walking difficult.

Unused - was The Top of a Destroyed Stairway~
   Once covered by thick stone, the entire ceiling and southern 
walls have been completely destroyed, the other walls suffering 
serious damage as well. Vines grow up and over the outside of 
the wall, thick and green, their long reach blanketing the 
remaining walls. The stairwell is still, more or less, passable, 
leading downwards and to the east.

Unused - was Vine Overrun Stone Battlements~
   Facing eastward towards the Ephel Duath, this stone walkway 
once appears to have served as part of a series of battlements 
for the fort. Now however, it is mostly destroyed, and has been 
overrun by growing vines, which blanket the area. A few of the 
original crenellations remain, covered in moss and vine, 
seemingly still standing proudly facing the east. A stone tower 
to the north has completely collapsed, blocking egress in that 
direction, but a path lies to the south, appearing open.

   Rising slightly above the surrounding battlements, this tower 
forms an imposing northeastern corner for the military bastion. 
It is surrounded by a thick, greystone wall that is only divided 
by several narrow, down-sloping arrow slits. The floor is marred 
and worn, covered by traces of ancient tar and blood residue. A 
large cast-bronze bell dominates the center of the tower.

The Base Of The Tower~
   A thick wooden door leads in from the village, providing 
access to the watchtower. The stone walls are thickest here at 
the base, flaring inward slightly as they progress upwards, 
typical of a tower's build. This area seems to mainly be for 
storage, as numerous crates have been stacked against the eastern 
wall. Aside from the way in, the only other exit appears to be a 
wooden stairway leading upwards.

   This ancient tower, which forms the northwestern defensive 
point of the bastion, has fallen into disrepair. Some of the 
higher stones on the wall have gone missing, or have plummeted 
onto the ground below, while the arrow-slits have been closed off 
with marred wood and loose rocks to make the structure sturdier. 
This portion of the battlements isn't as oft patrolled as the 
eastern walls.

stop animals escaping. The stall is large enough to hold an animal,
though it does not allow much movement. The floor is covered with
lots of old hay and straw.

   The southern battlement's former glory has been decimated by 
heavy catapult fire. The center of the battlements has crumbled 
and fallen, leaving a steep slope of rubble leading up from the 
ground far below, coming to a half-circle gap in the battlement. 
The gap is about ten yards across and the ledges on either side 
are cracked and jagged showing where they have recently broken 
off and fallen. The northern wall has been smashed down and the 
rubble there leads down into the top of the slope of rubble 
below, but the northern side is too steep to climb up. The area 
is splattered in black blood and carries the stench of death.

Sentry Point Atop the Tower~
   Leading up from below through a trapdoor, this wooden landing 
atop the tower provides a magnificent view of the surrounding 
countryside. There are no walls, only stout oaken beams leading 
upward to a conic shaped roof, which provides some protection 
from the elements. Wooden planks are nailed to the support beams 
at waist level, providing some protection, though not a lot, to 
one toppling over. From high above the Ithilien, one can spot a 
thick forest to the northeast, framed by jagged snow peaked 
mountains further east. To the south a cliff rises in the 
distance, and the lands to the west are held fast by a wide 
river.

   This is the main room of the tower, its walls thick and stout, 
the floor wooden beams. The construction looks new, the stone 
white and devoid of blemish. At each major direction a long and 
narrow vertical slit cuts through the stone wall, providing those 
inside with a somewhat obscured view of the surrounding 
countryside. The cold walls are mostly bare, a banner of the 
White Tree upon a black field the only covering. A small wood 
burning stove vents to the outside through a bronze pipe, 
providing the room with a bit of heat during the cold months. At 
the western end of the room a wooden stairway disappears into the 
floor, above it a ladder reaches up to a trapdoor.

walls sport delicate carvings of a king sitting upon a throne 
with numerous subjects cowering on the ground. Its roof is 
supported by additional columns that circle the main building at 
an arm-lengths distance. There is a small narrow entrance in the 
south, the door having been broken and discarded to the side.

polished wood, its bottom reinforced with roughly cut blocks of 
stone.

A Small, Cobblestone Square~
   A cobblestone path snakes gracefully in from the north, 
joining with a similar trail to the east to form a simple, but 
eloquent square of whitewashed, inlaid stones. At the center of 
the rocky mosaic sits a cylindrical stone well, covered in a thin 
layer of dewy moss, and crowned with a wooden shaft and crank. 
To the south runs the border wall of the village, and to the 
west, the grasses of a small, well-kept field stretch outwards, 
sparsely dotted with a handful of doeskin tents.

A Tree-Lined Path North of a Gate~
   A thin, cobblestone path winds in from the west here, curving 
eastward through a bumpy field of flat, churned earth. A barn 
can be seen a good distance to the northeast, and a number of 
cabins are set sparsely about the land on the opposite side of 
the trail. Fir trees dot the field, shading the path with their 
low, overhanging boughs. To the south, a gate rises up, a set of 
steps leading up to the battlements beside it.

Under the Fortified Gates~
   A pair of thick gates is set solidly in the eastern wall. The 
gates are made of multiple layers of wooden planks, and bound 
with iron, with a heavy bar kept in place by a locking mechanism 
to keep them closed. The space here is lit by torches, enclosed 
by three walls of grey stonework. A smaller pair of gates is set 
in the western wall, allowing a straight passage through. The 
ground floor of the garrison continues to the north, while a 
stone staircase on the western wall leads up to a trapdoor in the 
ceiling.

a battered, fire-gutted tower rising from the southern end. A

a dark brown, rocky bluff. Its dirt surface is packed solid by 
the heavy, regular tromp of booted feet. Lining the path on 
either side are boulders and rocks of varying sizes, cleared out 
of the way and piled up. Eastward, the trail opens out onto 
lower lands, though the not-so-distant peaks of the Ephel Duath 
dwarf this cliff by many sizes.

level hardwood, padded with carpets of fur and swaths of doeskin. 
A massive rectangular table dominates the center of the hall, its 
surface also drapped in a patchwork of sewn hide. The eastern 
wall is decorated with draping, blue-green fabrics and a series 
of mounted animal heads. On a slightly elevated platform behind 
the table stands the massive, and incredibly life-like visage of 
a grizzled black bear. The hall is bright, and well-lit.

old, rusted weapons are stacked among some rotten iron-banded 
chests. There is a small rounded hole in the ceiling directly

   The floor of this large, rectangular room is dusty and 
dirt-strewn, strands of hay, loose stalks of wheat and dried 
kernels of corn dotting the extent of the enclosure. Numerous 
crates and large burlap sacks are stacked at various intervals 
throughout the room, pushed up against the sheer, polished 
surfaces of the granary's walls. The ceiling looms ominously 
above, the great, wooden skeleton of the enclosure curving 
upwards towards a distant, domed apex. A series of crowded lofts 
claim numerous positions along the extent of the tall granary 
walls, strands of yellow hay hanging precipitously from their 
edges.
   A long coil of rope hangs from the nearest loft, seemingly

A Rocky Mining Tunnel~
   This tunnel has been roughly hewn out of rocky dirt and is lit 
dimly by torches secured within grimy metal holders, which are 
bolted to the wooden beams that keep the place from collapsing in 
on itself. Boulders and large rocks protrude from the walls, 
ceiling and floor at odd intervals, and one must watch their step 
carefully. Just to the north, the tunnel gives way to a dark, 
gaping vertical chasm extending for as far as the eye can see. 
Ropes and pulleys are visible, attatched to a wooden frame 
constructed within. 
   A rope dangles from above, the end of it tassled in bright red
twists of thread.

   This tunnel has been roughly hewn out of rocky dirt and is lit 
dimly by torches secured within grimy metal holders, which are 
bolted to the wooden beams that keep the place from collapsing in 
on itself. The air itself is somewhat dank and musty, lending 
the area an enclosed, stifling feel. Boulders and large rocks 
protrude from the walls, ceiling and floor at odd intervals, and 
one must watch their step carefully. The hammering of picks and 
the occasional shout can be heard, often mingled with the quiet 
skittering and squeaking of rodents. 
   The tunnel bends gradually here, and comes to an abrupt end to

A Split In The Tunnel~
   The tunnel widens here, forming a spacious circular area that 
splits off in three directions. It is reasonably lit by the 
guttering flames of several torches, and the walls and ceiling 
are supported by thick, roughly hewn wooden beams. The air 
remains dank and musty, and shadows skitter behind rocks and 
boulders, accompanied by unmistakably rodent-like squeaks. Dust, 
dirt, and rubble litter the floor thickly.

A Large Rubble Filled Cave~
   Though this cave is quite large, it still manages to look 
rather cramped and cluttered, due to the low, jagged ceiling and 
the stony rubble strewn throughout. The ground is smeared with a 
suspicious-looking white substance, and the monotonously slow 
drip of water can be heard, broken occasionally by the quiet 
flutter of leathery wings. No natural light makes its way into 
this area, and the air is rather dank and rancid.

split it open in various places. To the east, one such opening
provides a murky view of a deserted-looking tunnel.

   This untrustworthy-looking platform is made of rough, if 
sturdy, wooden planks nailed firmly together, crossed at 
intervals for further support. It has a single, rather wobbly 
handrail to the left and right, the other sides left open. A 
dizzying array of ropes and pulleys serve to support its creaking 
bulk, and a rusting iron knob is nailed to one of the wooden 
rails, to which the loose end of the rope could be lashed to keep 
the lift from going up or down.

A Rocky Mining Shaft~
   The walls and ceiling of this tunnel are composed of rocky 
dirt, supported by thick wooden beams. It is slightly wider than 
the opening to the north, and ends abruptly before a dark chasm 
leading directly downward. Ropes and pulleys are visible, 
attatched to a wooden frame that lines the vertical chasm. Dimly 
flickering torches keep this place reasonably lit even at night,

A Dark Hole Leading Straight Down~
   This square, vertical chasm extends into pitch darkness, a few 
foot and hand-holds provided by the rough surface of the rock it 
is hewn from. Sturdy wooden beams line each of the four corners, 
and ropes dangle from above to below, entwined with a complex 
looking array of pulleys and supports. It looks possible, though 
difficult and dangerous, to hug the walls and climb up or down.

A Foul, Stinking Rat's Nest~
   This cramped, musty cave smells incredibly foul, the stench of 
urine and rat assailing the senses. Even the shortest human is 
forced to duck to avoid colliding with the jagged, rocky ceiling, 
and the ground is littered with rat pellets, gnawed bones, rotted 
bits of meat, and other such distasteful refuse. Tattered shreds 
of cloth, clumps of fur, and other such materials pad much of the 
ground in the back of the cave, obviously a nest of some sort. 
  A large, jagged crack opens up in a section of the cave wall,
a whiff of fresher air wafting through it.

Upon a Dirt Trail Through Fields~
   Cutting a fairly straight path through the fields, this trail 
leads up to the ruins of a small cottage to the north. In the 
seasons of growth, the tall stalks of staple crops grow along the 
sides of the trail to the east and west, hemming it in. The 
cottage is built from stone, though its walls are charred from 
ash and soot, and what appears to have been thatch roofing has 
suffered from the ravages of fire and lies collapsed inward.

Inside a Thatch-Roofed Cottage~
   Assembled stone by stone, this cottage looks to be the result 
of hard labor. It is rather small, able to house at most two 
people comfortably. Windows on either side of a door on the 
southern wall are little more than holes in the wall, covered 
with crude shutters. The roof overhead is supported by beams of 
timber, and laid with dry thatching.

region. It looks spacious enough to house a family without being 
too cramped and has a door set in the west wall, itself somewhat 
newer in appearance than the rest of the walls, leading to

A Steeply Sloping Mining Tunnel~
   The tunnel's rocky floor slopes down rapidly from above, 
descending rapidly into the heart of the Mindolluin Mountains. 
The sounds of the mines grow slowly fainter, and it is obvious 
that this portion is not quite as often frequented by the daily 
workers. Torches flicker weakly in their rusting metal holders, 
and dust lies thickly over almost every surface, disturbed only 
slightly by past footsteps through the winding course of this 
passageway deep below Middle-Earth's surface. 
   The flutter of leathery wings can be heard overhead from time 
to time, and soft squeakings and skitterings hint that the area 
is still inhabited, if not by humans.

An Abrupt End To The Tunnel~
   Ending somewhat abruptly, this portion of the tunnel looks 
long abandoned, dust having settled heavily into the deep gouges 
and cracks that picks must have made some time long ago. The 
stench of refuse, rot and urine is strong here, mingling with the 
musty, stale air and making it rather unpleasant to breathe. 
White splatters of guano cover the floor liberally, and squeaks 
and flutterings of leathery wings are a constant as bats flit 
about, keeping to the shadows and the roof of the tunnel high 
above. The tunnel widens to the east, disappearing into the 
murky darkness beyond. Amid the outcroppings and curtains of 
stone which make up the irregular surface of the high ceiling, a 
black crevice, almost wide enough to admit a grown man, hints at 
unseen natural grottoes and chambers above.

A Dark, Jagged Tunnel~
   Narrow enough that only two men could walk abreast, this 
tunnel seems rather neglected, and the torches have long been 
left ashen, and are often simply missing from the rusting metal 
brackets where they belong. Jagged rocks protrude from all 
angles, leaving an impression of hasty, incomplete digging. Dust 
covers the area thickly, and odd, sibilant sounds penetrate the 
darkness from time to time, as well as the occasional clicking 
and rustling noise. It is utterly quiet otherwise, and the air 
is dank and still. 
   The tunnel begins to take a steep upward slant to the north 
here, levelling out as it runs toward a meandering curve to the 
south.

A Low-Ceilinged, Stinking Underground Cave~
   The steeply upward-sloping tunnel levels out and broadens into 
a dank, murky cave. Stalactites stab downward toward their 
smaller mates, rough and bumpy stalagmites that push up from the 
filthy, bone and fur-strewn rock ground. Dips and hollows in the 
floor, which are hardly visible until one is right upon them, 
make the going treacherous, and the walls are uneven and jagged. 
The air stinks of refuse, rot, and animal, so thick one could 
almost cut it with a knife.

A Cramped And Winding Tunnel~
   This long, narrow tunnel is obviously not man-made, as it 
twists back and forth in no particular direction. The walls and 
roof of the tunnel, however, have been worn smooth by water that 
must have flowed here at one time, many years ago. The short 
height of the tunnel, and the narrow, meandering path it takes 
make it very difficult to travel through. 
   A split opens up in the tunnel wall to the west, a boulder 
blocking most of it, though it still looks passable.

The Shore Of An Underground Lake~
   This large underground cavern has obviously been created over 
many thousands of years by the artistic hand of time. The walls 
have been worn smooth, and watermarks can be seen as high as ten 
feet above an average man's height. The craggy roof soars at 
least one hundred feet above, and large, twisted stalactites jut 
down toward the water. Stalagmites extend out of the freezing 
cold water of a huge underground lake, toward their mates above. 
The water is completely still and shimmers eerily, refracting any 
light toward the cave walls to create an almost fae-like, 
otherworldly effect. 
   It might be possible for the very daring to pick their way 
along a crumbling, naturally formed ridge that meanders slowly 
along the cave's wall.

A Treacherous Path Above Sharp Rocks And Water~
   Shimmering light dances off of the freezing cold, crystal 
clear water that lies some distance below this treacherous ridge 
formed of slippery rock, stalagmites offering the occasional 
hand-hold. The light is otherworldly and eerie, filtering down 
from some unseen crack in the roof of this immense cave. Below 
the ridge is a painful looking fall, hard, unforgiving rock 
forming a slight ledge before sliding down into the deep waters 
of the lake. Adding to the threat is the presence of several 
sharp jagged rocks that protrude upward.

A Ledge Partially Covered By Freezing Water~
   Slipping halfway into the frigid, crystal clear waters of the 
lake, this ledge is smooth and wide, but formed of unforgiving 
rock. The wall leading up to the ridge above has a few 
protrusions, but is dangerously slick. Surrounding the ledge is 
nothing but water, with the occasional boulder sticking up 
through the surface. Some distance away to the north is the lake 
shore, barely visible in the shimmering, eerie light. 
   The ledge continues a little ways out into the water, dipping 
just beneath its glass-like surface.

An Underground Ledge Surrounded By Water~
   Widening out from the treacherous pathway winding along the 
wall, this particular area forms a rather large, safe ledge. The 
edges are sheer and slick, making it impossible to climb safely 
downward, though a foolish step might send you tumbling downward 
into the shock of cold water. The ground is fairly smooth rock, 
watermarks forming their striated patterns over it. The view is 
nothing short of stunning, the muted, filtered light from some 
unseen source refracting off the lake to shimmer off of the 
massive stalactites and the smooth patterns of rock that form the 
expansive cavern walls.

To the west lies a farmhouse, its whitewashed walls dirty from

though a door set in the north wall suggests more rooms than this 
one alone. The walls are well-constructed from wooden planks, 
painted white, above a short foundation of stone. Along the top 
of the walls, beams stretch across the room, supporting the 
peaked thatch roof above. The floor is made of wooden planks 
which creak in a few places. In spots the floor appears clean 
while in other spots it is quite dusty.

   This cave is mostly dark letting in little natural light from 
outside as the sound of rushing water sweeps over the whole area. 
The rocky, uneven floor of the cave has been smoothed out by the 
running of water making the footing ultimately treacherous. 
Small patches of moss and lichen grow around the insides of the 
cave, creating almost a carpet upon the floor.

have also been tossed about in this area, some of it partially 
buried in a great pile of rubble and rock, the tunnel having

   The tunnel begins to slope here leading up towards the 
unknown. A series of pools have accumulated here due to the 
water run off from somewhere to the east making it clear that 
these caves were carved from the flow of water through the hills 
at some point of time. This has caused occasional 
crystallization in the rock walls here and a few of the stones 
glitter slightly.

The rock walls of the cavern are very similar to the rest of it

incline in places, though whether it is of human or animal origin 
is very difficult to tell by the amount it has been aged.

A Overgrown, Weed Infested Pasture~
   This field was clearly a pasture for grazing animals at one 
time. Now it has been turned into a somewhat awkward cemetery to 
remember the dead. As so much of the east Ithilien, it has clear 
that this field has been drenched in blood at one point or 
another. Broken, unused farm equipment has been spread out from 
point to point. Occasional animal droppings show that there is 
at least one animal which still uses this pasture from time to 
time, but it has clearly fallen from its former grace.

   This area is very densely packed with woods, giving off a very 
constricted feeling. The large, thick trees grow on all sides, 
and are very piney, which allows the tree's to provide good cover

There is a thin, well used trail leading through the brush for a 
long distance that weaves back and forth making it almost 
impossible to see around the next corner.

Ankle-Deep Water On A Partially Submerged Ledge~
   The calmness of the lake's surface hides the strong currents 
underneath that would surely drag any swimmer down into the icy 
depths, noticeable as it tugs on the feet of anyone standing in 
this ankle-deep portion where the ledge dips underwater. Far 
above is the jagged roof of the cavern, and in the dim, 
shimmering light, the lake's shore can be distantly made out a 
far swim away to the north. The precarious ledge rises out of 
the water to the south, providing much safer purchase.

Inside a Simple Wooden Shed~
   This adequately sized wooden shed is very dimly lit, the only 
light coming from gaps in the hastily-made walls. Thin slivers 
of light reveal the wooden planks that make up the sturdy floor. 
The walls are supported by large logs standing vertically, the 
bark stripped off of them, making them bare. The ceiling of this 
simple shed is made of wood and straw, and though modest, 
apparently keeps things from leaking and is in good shape.

A Field~
   An overgrown field lies here, weeds the only thing growing 
where crops once did. Amidst them are the remains of a cottage, 
burned down to its foundation, only a small remnant or two to 
indicate that walls once enclosed a dwelling here. Around it, a 
small wall lies in disrepair, seemingly missing more stones than 
what were once used in its construction. Beyond, the fields of 
the North Ithilien stretch out, woods opening behind them to the 
north and west.

A Stagnant Underground Pool~
   Slime covers the entirety of the northern wall of this cave, 
the floor evening out and becoming roughly hewn stone. The 
northernmost floor is covered by several inches of water-- a 
dirty, murky pool having formed over time. The entire cavern 
smells musty, like an old book freshly opened.

A Dank, Dirty Cave~
   Humid, dirty, and dark as a moonless night, the tunnel seems 
to stretch on for quite some distance to the east. To the north, 
an ethereal dripping sound steadily, rhythymically echoes. The 
tunnel seems to be dug out of earth, the floor being rocky and 
uneven. It is quite apparent that this is not a natural 
formation. In the western section of the tunnel, the ground 
above has collapsed, slivers of light spilling in from cracks in 
the rocks. A large, broken stone slab lies against the south 
wall, near what used to be a tunnel opening leading down, but is 
now completely sealed off by a rockfall.

A Rough Dirt Tunnel~
   The air and odors get heavier toward the east, the caverns 
continuing on for all visibility. Scuttle-marks are evident in 
the fresh, unpacked dirt. Aside from the few slender beams 
poking in from the collapsed part to the west, no light pervades 
the veil of darkness, save that of torches or candles.

A Curve in the Cavern~
   The cavern curves from west to south and vice versa, the walls 
slowly transition to rock to the south. The ground, as well, 
levels out, sloping upwards to the west and staying flat to the 
south. A drip echoes from somewhere to the west, steady and 
rhythymic, and from the south, a pungent odor wafts through the 
stale, stagnant air.

A Sprawling, Cavernous Lair~
   This room in the cavern is decidedly different than the rest, 
as, for one, the walls, floor, and ceiling are all of 
roughly-hewn stone instead of dirt. As well, the odors of all 
things deadly, nauseating, sickening, and decaying seem to have 
culminated into one horrific stench, the entire area caked in it.

A Cavernous Stairwell~
   Bearing semblance to its normal-sized cousins, this stairwell 
is a massive set of twenty or so four-foot-tall steps, leading 
deep into the earth from a previous passage within the surface. 
At the top, a large hole lies, the other side blocked by a 
boulder. At the bottom, the cavern stretches on.

An Earthen Tunnel Opening Upwards~
   At the feet of a towering set of packed-earth stairs lays this 
large, vaulted-ceiling tunnel. The darkness stretches upwards as 
far as the eye can see, though walls are definitely nearby to the 
north, west, and south. The tunnel continues eastward. The 
floors, ceiling and walls, unlike the stairs, are of limestone; 
the above caverns and this one seem entirely different.

A Tunnel Stretching East and West~
   This cavern, seemingly natural, has walls of smoothed 
limestone. Stalagtites and stalagmites are few and far between, 
the smoothed floor and ceiling offering little in the means of 
nonconformnity. Sweeping wide eastward, the tunnel begins to 
quickly slope downward, and westward it slopes gently upward.

   Sloping quickly downward, the cave passage begins to get more

protruding from here and there. The floor becomes littered with 
pebbels the further down it travels, and finally opens up in a 
rocky landing.

A Narrow Path Alongside a Cliff Within the Earth~
   The tunnel changes drastically here, on two measures; for one, 
it is limestone to the west and simply standard rock and dirt to 
the east; and for another, to the west, the cavern is merely 
wide, but to the east, it is enormous. On the south side of the 
opening lies a sheer precipice, and eastward leads a simple, 
narrow dust-and-dirt path, sloping gradually downwards, further 
into the depths of darkness.

Alongside a Cliff Deep Underground~
   A single misstep could easily cause a nasty spill over the 
cliff southward; however, the 'narrow' ledge could easily hold 
two thin people abreast with neither falling nor being crushed. 
The dirty floor seems fairly undisturbed, and the rocky wall and 
precipice seem as lifeless as the rest of the cavern. The path 
continues eastward, where a bend in it is visible; southward lies 
a quick drop down.

   Spreading wide and turning southward, the path goes around the 
edge of the cliff. To the south is no longer a drop, but perhaps 
he gentlest-sloping path available. Were there light, most of 
the cavern would be visible from such a vantage point: here it is 
easy to see both sides of the precipice, up and down. The path 
continues uphill westward and downhill southward.

A Sprawling Earthen Cave~
   Turning westward and northward, this part of an underground 
cavern slopes greatly. The walls are of rocky nature, although 
they appear to be of natural make. Northward, the slope begins 
to get steeper and steeper as it rises northwest above a 
precipice; westward, it gradually slopes to a stop at the base of 
the same cliff.

few places, soft dirt pokes through. Those who might attempt it 
could try climbing up the nearly sheer cliff face to the north.

   The walls of the cavern open wider, into an almost perfectly

could likely be climbed by those brave (or foolhearty) enough to 
attempt to do so. The ground is of hewn rock, and is quite 
smooth; there appear to be no exists except to the west, where a 
dust-and-dirt path leads back up the slopes.

A Small Hollow~
   The tree's in this area start give way, making an open hollow 
in the small parcel of tree's behind the shack. This hollow, 
although small, does well to shelter, and hide those within. 
There seems to be only a few birds abou here, but they are 
singing loudly throughout the day. This space can easily afford 
to house a small number of people, and the smell of some of spots 
in here tell one who steps here that it does. The only exit is 
back east, up the trail to the small shack in the distance.

parts, the area below the gates is cleared of the masses so that 
the large double doors can be opened. Solid pewter hangings have 
been attached to the outer walls of the Arena and etched on them 
are the forms of different men fighting with various weapons and 
armour. The occasional stone statue can also be seen above the 
crowd of people showing a victorious warrior standing proudly.

fighters permeate throughout the arena. This corridor leads up 
to a large hallway above. It also leads back towards the gates

the crowd surges and swells like a great ocean tide. The 
visibility these seats offer is quite excellent, a better vantage

to the atmosphere. A set of small barred windows high in the

cold. The corrider widens to the south beyond the doors, and to 
the north it opens up into the barracks of the slaves.

   This large room has been designed as a barracks for the

filled with mostly slaves, this room is quite large and is 
impressively made. The wood of the walls are finely detailed and 
worked, and have been stained a nice, light brown to add a simple 
kind of elegance to it. The room itself is composed of four long 
walls, with exits on all sides. A large dark hallway leads 
south, another decent sized room lies to the east, what smells 
like a kitchen is to the north, and west lies an armour with a 
selection of tools for any coming battle.

training in one way or another.

The large, iron gates stands to the south, ready to be opened at

humour to all fighters standing in this room when they etched the 
area around the gates to resemble a beasts maw, wide open, to 
accept the fighters into the pit.

The inside of this place is small and cramped, and the only two 
places to sit, and tiny, uncomfortable wooden benches on the

to see clearly, but it is a dreary sight indeed. The ride is

solid oak reinforced with iron bands, a small window crossed with 
iron bars completes the door. Neat stone walls, floor and 
ceiling reside close together, making the small space cramped.

A Fortified Wooden Enclosure~
   The walls of this small, but well-defended enclosure are
fashioned of thick, sanded logs. The floor is made of nailed 
planks of driftwood, stained, and covered in a series of bearskin 
carpets. Along the north wall sits a small fireplace, bordered 
by a series of simple wooden chairs. The wood-beamed ceiling of 
the room sits close to the floor, and a rope ladder hangs from
an open square near the eastern wall. The southern wall is draped 
in rough, blue-green fabrics, and is vibrantly decorated.
   A thick, brass-handled oak door sits in the western stretch
of the enclosure, granting access to the road outside.

A Damp, Slick-floored Tunnel~
   Water continually filters in from the ground above, dripping down 
like an incessant soft rain. This constantly damp environment 
has over time granted the floor a dangerously slick coating of 
slimy buildup. Rocks protrude from the walls in random 
procession, and pockets dot across the ceiling from where the 
erosion of time has caused small collapses of the tunnel. Mixed 
in with the slime on the floor are an excessive amount of sharp 
rocks and stones, all littered about by the ravage of time.

A Slanty, Damp Tunnel~
   Heavy amounts of moisture give a musky scent of wet rot and age 
to the air. The walls of this section of cave tunnel seem to 
have collapsed to the north, a gaping hole torn into the rock. 
The narrow twisting path is mostly blocked off where the wall has 
fallen in, leaving little choice but to clamber over the pile of 
fallen rocks to go further. The floor of the entire area seems 
to slant towards the hole in the wall to the north.

A Slick Sharply Slanted Section~
   Greasy and slick this nearly sheer surface slants at an extreme 
angle. The downright smooth rock has received a moist coating of 
dark mucus over a period of years giving this area a dangerously 
slick footing. The sharp angle goes down into a dark sinkhole of 
jagged rock. There are few handholds to allow any grip at all 
and lines can be seen in the mucus layer where it appears bodies 
have slid uncontrolled into the dark hole below. There are no 
signs of anything crawling out.

A Severe Sinkhole~
   Errosion of some sort has over time removed the ability the 
ground here to stay level, caving in on itself to create this 
severe drop. Sheer walls that have been smoothed by a continual 
rubbing of some sort leave very few options should one try to 
scale it. Added to the vertical imposition that the sinkhole 
presents is a coating of slimy mucus on everything. In the 
darkness below a heavy smell that speaks of ancient decay and 
rotting flesh seeps upwards.

A Bone Littered Pit~
   A thick, brackish mucus covers the floor and walls, and it's 
depth comes up to the average man's chest in places. Considering 
the rotting smell of decaying flesh that permeates the air and 
the numerous bones poking up from the sludge it would seem that 
the mucus is in fact the jellied flesh of long dead creatures and 
people. Some skulls can be seen in the filthy muck suggesting 
that more then one person has met their end here. Occasionally a 
thick pulse travels through the mucus like a living throb.

A Sharply Twisting Tunnel~
   Nearly appearing a dead end, this pathway comes to a halt as 
it hits a thick vein of solid black marble. The grainy black 
marble leaves the path no choice but to twist suddenly to the 
side as the erosion of time has better delved into the softer 
sandstone around it. Peculiar markings mar the side of the 
marble face, a picture scratched into it with some crude tool.

blow through the wall. There seems to be a very tight space to 
the south, however it is far too collapsed now for even the

marring the rocky walls. Heavy drag lines can be seen where the 
bodies of animals have been pulled across the ground. The 
occasional chunk of fur has been torn off or shredded spotting

strips of the cloth, it has been pressed and packed down by the

carrion permeates every breath of air in this den. The lumpy 
cloth floor and odd bone protrusions suggests that more then one 
body may be buried under the cloth pile.

A Small Shack~
   The walls of this small shack are made of stone on the bottom, 
topped with bricks of sod at eye level. The roof is made from 
roughly-hewn timber and does not look particularly leak-proof. 
The floor is made of dirt, solid from years of use. There are no 
windows in the walls and a small pole in the center of the room 
offers both hooks to hang objects as well as additional support 
for the roof.

A Small Mill~
   Smaller than some mills but still large enough to handle the 
demands of the surrounding farmland, this small mill is 
constructed of stone and wood and situated along a branch of the 
Heledhnen tributary. The single room of the mill is filled with 
the mechanical device of the millstone. Alongside the assembly 
is a stepped wooden platform. The room is considerably dirty, 
both from dust and flour.

   This landing has been quickly put together of small, flat

attached to the rafters too well and every so often it feels like 
it's about to shift. There are handholds up on some beams for 
holding onto, once one manages to climb up here, and the rope

   This room is for the private use of the squires of the Lord 
Astirian. It is quite spacious compared to most rooms, and 
comfortable. The walls and ceiling are made of solid blocks of 
stone, making up part of the bastion itself. The stones are 
bare, except for some scones where torches can be placed to keep 
the room lit. The walls have been covered in various displays of 
Astirian Heraldry, including a beautiful tapestry displaying a 
sword preceeding a seven-pointed star. The only exit is back

leads between a small farmhouse to the north and fields to the 
east. The farmhouse to the north is roughly square in shape. 
Made of wood, its high-peaked roof reaches nearly twice as high 
as the rest of the building. On the south side, a large wide 
door is set in the wall and several feet above it, a window looks 
out over the fields. A few trees shade this path a portion of

terminates at a door built into the south side of the structure. 
The mill rises out from the surrounding countryside, its four 
great sails visible from some distance away. The sound of the 
sails as they turn is a combination of creaking wood and a low 
groan. To the nearby west, a fence separates the path from the 
fields beyond while an old wagon sits alongside it, grass growing 
around its wheels.

   This stall is large enough to accomodate a horse. The walls 
of the stall are six feet tall, not reaching the ceiling yet high 
enough to prevent animals from other stalls from seeing into each 
others'. The floor is covered in straw and a feeding trough has 
been attached to the back wall. A four-foot tall door to the 
west provides access in and out of the stall.

Inside A Stall~
   This large box stall has been subdivided into several smaller 
stalls, each large enough to accommodate a horse comfortably. 
The stall walls do not quite reach the ceiling formed by the loft 
floor overhead, but they are tall enough to prevent each horse 
from seeing over. A feeding trough is attached so as to serve 
all of these stalls, and a large window set high on the outside 
wall allows light and ventilation when open. A four-foot high 
door to the west provides access to and from the main part of the 
stable.

   With its ceiling over twenty feet above the floor, this large 
loft can hold hay, straw, and feed for a number of horses. The 
loosely fitted floorboards creak a bit when walked upon but

A Reeking Altar Room~
   This extension of the cairn opens up quickly into a generous 
sized room. There is a sharp pungent odor of animal and death 
that lingers here, possibly due to the blood covered walls. 
Red's and whites compete on every wall for space, symbols and 
diagrams painted into the wall have all been accented by blood 
which long since dried. The plethora of menacingly formed 
symbols all seems to correlate and point towards the center of 
the room where a human sized grey and dark red altar sits. 
Chunks of hair and rotting carrion litter the floor, bones and 
flesh mingling to produce the intense odors.

   Built above the main room of the house, this loft is 
accessible via a narrow staircase set in the south wall. The 
wood plank floor is quite sturdy and appears fairly new. There 
is a nice amount of floor space though the ceiling is barely high 
enough for a person to stand without hitting their head on the 
roof rafters. A small window is set in the east wall affording a

A Lumber Camp~
   This camp appears to be rather make-shift, no more than a 
temporary base of operations while the area is logged. A small 
stream runs through the middle of the camp, powering a lumber 
mill. The ground is dirt and mud, all vegetation having been 
torn up or trampled until only bare soil remains. To the east 
lies a large crude, log building while to the west lies a smaller 
log shack. To the north, the forest is being cleared of trees.

   This small shack is very poorly constructed, hinting that it 
is viewed as a temporary structure and nothing more. Regardless, 
it is quite sturdy, the walls being made of thick logs. In the 
east wall, a rough doorway has been made and a plank door hung in 
it. The floor is dirt, not quite packed enough to prevent 
kicking up dust or becoming muddy when wet.

A Spiral Stair Hewn Into the Rock Around a Deep Shaft~
   Cut roughly into the vaguely circular walls about a deep 
shaft, plunging down into the inky depths of the earth is a 
spiralling staircase of rock. It is wide enough for two humans 
to walk abreast comfortably, but the absence of a railing of any 
kind on the side overlooking the deep drop would discourage any 
sort of descent or ascent other than in single file. The stair 
disappears far down below into the darkness, and occasionally the 
sound of a high-pitched chittering wafts up from below. At the 
top of the stair it flattens out to a small platform facing a 
hole in the wall that is blocked by a thick, stone slab. A 
closer look reveals scraping marks on the wall either side of the 
slab as if it has been shifted aside recently.

A Narrow Ledge Beside a Deep Fissure~
   The stone steps of the stair stop at a small uneven area 
beside the shaft that still continues further down. The platform 
narrows slightly to follow a ledge that is cut into the northern 
wall above a deep fissure that connects to the shaft. The ledge 
leads off to the west, snaking as the wall does, and then 
disappears around a corner. The ceiling of the tunnel is not 
very high overhead, and occasional stalactites hang from it.

   The stair hewn into the walls around a deep, wide shaft 
continue on in the inky blackness, the only sounds discernable 
being the occasional high-pitched chitter of something down 
below. The stairs are not very wide, making the safest means of 
going up or down to be to hug the wall in single file. The 
darkness swallows the stair both above and below.

   As the fissure abruptly ends, the tunnel continues westwards, 
snaking here and there. The floor is rough and pitted, making it 
very uneven, and large chunks of rock litter the ground, also 
obstructing passage. The tunnel is wide enough for several men 
to walk abreast, and has a relatively high ceiling. Two other 
tunnels, not quite so wide, lead off from this one, to the north 
and to the south.

   The tunnel opens out into a relatively large cavern, with 
uneven, rounded walls, and a high, domed ceiling. Rock 
formations rise up from the ground to meet those that hang from 
the top, and up in the gloom there comes the sound of a soft 
chittering and squeaking. This cave appears to have been 
completely naturally formed with the exception of the tunnel that 
leads to it. Upon the ground are strewn many bones, some animal, 
some human, along with scraps of clothing and other odd items.

made to unblock the passage by someone.

rough, are relatively easy to use. The ceiling is high enough 
that a tall man need not have to worry about ducking his head, 
and the walls are fairly close in, making the staircase feel a 
trifle cramped. They descend for quite some distance, and at the 
foot of them, an archway in the tunnel opens into another 
passage, leading northwards. The opening is blocked by a heavy 
oaken door.

relatively straight, although quite rough and the floor 
underneath is strewn with fragments of rock, and pitted in 
various places making it a little uneven. Off to the east side, 
a narrow stone bench seems to have been carved into the wall in a 
small alcove. The passage north is blocked by a thick, 
iron-reinforced door of stout oak.

about the cave floor, some still with scraps of rotting flesh

   This small attic is a bit cramped, in part due to its size but 
mainly on account of the sloping walls which are actually the 
steep roof of the house. Made from large timbers, the rafters 
are set at a high-degree angle and although they appear old, they 
nevertheless seem very sturdy. In contrast to the aged look of 
the roof, the floor appears new. The pine planks of its 
construction are well-fitted and the floor appears quite capable 
of holding a significant amount of weight. In the northeast 
corner of the room is a large opening through which a staircase 
descends. The walls of the room are white-washed and a shuttered 
window is set in the south side.

A Side Room~
   Apparently of newer construction than the main room of the 
house, this room is about the same size. The wooden walls are 
made of pine and white-washed to match the interior of the rest 
of the house. The floor is likewise made of pine, the planks 
well-fitted together so that there are no visible cracks between 
them, save for a trapdoor in the corner of the room. The ceiling 
slopes gently downward from east to west and features sturdy pine 
beams supporting it. The room is windowless save for a single 
window in the south wall.

A Small Plot of Land~
   A rickety wood fence surrounds the perimeter of this land, 
appearing to be roughly an acre or so in size. The land looks to 
have been worked in the past though some shrubs and weed can be 
seen along the edge of the fenceline. The territory of the 
surrounding farmers can be seen to the north and east. A small 
path leads from the south side of the field. To the west sits a 
house and to the south is a small barn.

Common Room Of The Spear and Shield Inn~
   A bit ramshackle in construction, its walls unpainted and the 
wood rough in spots, this large room has a frontier-feel to it. 
A bar runs along the back wall and several tables are scattered 
through the rest of the room. Alongside the bar, a wooden 
staircase leads up to the next floor. Behind the bar is a door, 
likely leading back to the kitchen. Along the north wall is a 
large fireplace made of stone, a ratty-looking bearskin rug lying 
before it. To the east is the door leading out of the room.

The Kitchen Of The Spear And Shield Inn~
   Constructed of wood, this small room is obviously a kitchen as 
the shelves, stove, and smell of food attest to. The floor is 
the only part of this room that looks to have been sanded, that 
being more likely the result of the traffic of feet over its 
surfact than of deliberate sanding. Overhead, the rafters of the 
roof are visible though the ceiling appears leak-proof. A 
curtained doorway is set in the north wall while a wooden door in 
the east leads to the main room of the building.

On A Short Path Before An Inn~
   Inside the palisade, a short path leads west to a two-story 
building constructed of wood. Somewhat crude in its design, the 
walls finished more by the weather than by the builders, this 
building nevertheless looks sturdy. Attached to the side of the 
building, north of the path is a smaller structure, most likely a 
stable judging from the size of the door. The building is 
completely surrounded by the palisade, though passage around its 
south side is blocked by a pile of firewood and the stable to the 
north. To the east, a wooden gate has been set in the palisade 
and alongside it stands a wooden platform, while to the south a 
thick wooden door leads into the stone tower.

A Path Between A Palisade And A Fenced Pasture~
   This path cuts through the countryside and here leads past a 
palisaded structure and a pasture. To the west stands a palisade 
surrounding a building, a large tower dominating the area. Ten 
foot high walls made of tree trunks sharpened to a point prevent 
any easy entrance into the fortification. Beyond the palisade, a 
two-story wooden building can be seen rising above the walls. A 
large gate has been set in the palisade here, extending even 
higher than the wall itself. To the east, a wood fence encloses 
a large pasture. A wooden gate has been built into the fence 
here allowing access into the pasture. To the north, the path 
continues alongside the fence while to the south, the path 
disappears into the surrounding fields.

A Large Fenced-In Pasture~
   This is a large fenced-in pasture amidst the surrounding 
farmland. Enclosed by a split-log fence, the pasture covers 
several acres of land. Two gates are set in the fence, one to 
the west and one to the north. Beyond the west gate lies a 
palisade while to the northeast, a small farmstead lies beyond 
the north gate. To the east is farmland and, in the distance, 
woods. Running alongside the fence on the north and west sides 
is a small path.

   This shed is small, but very well-constructed. Thick, sturdy 
boards have been used in its creation, fitted tightly together

A Wide Cavern Behind a Waterfall~
   This is a wide cavern with a wet floor of polished stone, a 
door step as it were, with a rough-hewn gate of rock opening 
darkly to the east. But to the west a thin veil of water is 
hung, sprinkling tiny droplets of water about the room, each one 
reflecting individually the light from the torches set into the 
walls about the room. It resembles standing at the window of a 
grand tower, curtained with threaded jewels of silver and gold, 
and ruby, sapphire and amethyst, all kindled with an unconsuming 
fire. The air in the cave is cool and damp, but not 
uncomfortably so.

A Wide, Rough-hewn Main Chamber~
   This is a rock-chamber, wide and rough, with an uneven sloping 
rough. Marks along the walls appear to have been carved to hold 
torches at even intervals. The cave is quite large and looks to 
be able to hold many people in relative comfort. Some of the 
cavern is obviously formed naturally, other portions have been 
hewn by skilled hands. From the natural formations, it hints 
that water used to flow through this cave, but was diverted long 
ago by craftsmen to fall much higher, from above the caverns. 
There is a wide archway to the south, and in the north eastern 
corner a small, stone, spiral stair leading down.

   The rock forming this passage is smooth and very dark. The 
ceiling is high enough for a tall Man to walk upright, and just 
wide enough for two to walk abreast. The air within is close and 
mildly damp, and the tunnel continues on without significantly 
ascending or descending. Two narrow slits have been carved into 
the easter rock face and appear to have been intended to hold 
torches or lanterns at some point.

   The stair begins where a dark tunnel opens up, and continues

the air, and perhaps seepage through the rocks, the steps are wet 
and slippery. Torches have been placed at even intervals up the 
flight of stairs, lighting the way.

   This small platform is little more than a ledge, hewn into the 
side of a deep shaft of rock. From high over head the sky can be 
seen and the waters come tumbling down into the deep basin far 
below, spraying the rock with thousands of glistening droplets. 
Two sets of stairs lead away, one, disappearing into the rock and 
then emerging again near the southern bank of the pool, and the 
other going directly up like a turret-stair.

A Wide Flat Rock Without Railing or Parapet~
   The turret-like stone stair opens up onto a wide flat rock, 
high above the churning waters below. The stone is wet and 
slippery, and is without any sort of railing or parapet. Very 
close, to the east, the torrent falls, splashing over many 
terraces and then, pouring down a steep race, it fills a 
smooth-hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked with foam. 
It plunges then over a sheer face that yawns at the platform's 
edge. Far below, the roiling waters of the pool, filled with 
knife-like rocks can be seen.

Narrow Opening Shrouded with Thick Bushes~
   A narrow opening in the rock-face at the end of the stair, 
widens out on top of the southern bank of the pool. Several 
bushes grow thickly about the opening, obscuring it from the 
surrounding area. The bank is covered with many stones, flat and 
slippery, making the ground treacherous. The waters edge is 
still several feet below the edge of the bank, and should one 
fall in, there is no discernable easy way back up.

Amid the Churning Waters of the Forbidden Pool~
   All about the waters within the deep, stone basin of rock, 
churn and gurgle at the base of the waterfall. The pool is 
generally oval-shaped, and filled with knife-like, razor-sharp 
rocks. The waters are deep and in constant motion, and flow 
again out of the pool down through a narrow crevasse in the rocky 
walls of the stone shaft. The sky is visible through the mist 
and spray far above. The bank is too steep and slippery in most 
places to climb, however the water is shallower to the south.

A Narrow Ledge Before a Waterfall~
   A narrow path cuts into the side of a long shaft of rock, 
emerging from a small opening in the side of the rock-face. It 
is wide enough for only one person to walk it at a time, forcing 
groups of people to go single file. To the west, the edge gives 
way to a sheer drop that extends far down to the basin below. 
The narrow path stops just before the falling curtain of water 
that cascades down the cliff face from a significant height 
above, spraying the area with tiny jewel-like droplets of water, 
by the thousands. The rushing sound of the falls dominates the 
space about, blocking out other sounds. In the rock face beside 
the path is a narrow crevasse, partially concealed by small 
shrubs.

A Rocky Outcropping Overlooking a Gorge Path~
   This outcropping is very high above the floor of the gorge 
below, the only safe way down being the trail that heads back 
towards the east. It is a small area of rock that stands out 
from the top of the ridge, with natural formations along its edge 
that might vaguely resemble parapets. It overlooks directly a 
trail that continues along the northern slope of the gorge, 
below.

A Natural Niche~
   This small natural niche is approximately the size of a coffin 
set on its end. The walls are shorn, looking to have been formed 
by a large crack that ends about two feet in to a sheer wall. 
The walls, floor and ceiling are unadulterated stone and form an 
almost flawless, if claustrophobic, chamber.

A Deep Cleft Between Two Sheer Rock-Faces~
   Two sheer walls of rock rise up high on either side of a path 
threading its way between them, very close together and almost 
completely blocking out the sky above. The path is mostly solid 
rock, with tufts of whatever grass or brush is resilient enough 
to exist in whatever soil they can find in gaps and crevasses. 
The air is slightly moist, touched by a fine rain, and the sound 
of rushing waters can be heard quite distinctly.

A Steep Trail Up the Side of a Narrow Gorge~
   The trail here is very steep, climbing up from a deep cleft in 
a rocky wall to the east, to continue much higher towards the 
west on the northern side of the gorge. Small stones are strewn 
about the trail, making it dangerous, and occasionally there are 
small, tough shrubs sprouting determinedly up from gaps in the 
rock.

On a Trail in A Narrow Gorge~
   A rocky path winds its way through a narrow gorge, formed by 
two, almost sheer, walls of rock on the northern and southern 
sides. The path is little more than a sliver of a trail a short 
distance up the northern slope. Down at the very base of the 
gorge swiftly flows a rushing stream, emerging from an opening in 
the rocks to the east, where the path disappears into a deep 
cleft, and heading in a south-westerly direction. To the west 
the trail stops at the foot of a long stair that carries on up 
and out of the gorge.

A Steep, Naturally Formed Stone Stair~
   Rocks stick out from the earth in the side of the gorge in a 
staggered fashion, forming a rough, uneven stair, that leads 
people either up out of the gorge upon its western end, or down 
into it to the path below. The makeshift stair is very long, and 
is relatively narrow, forcing groups to ascend or descend in 
single file. As the steps are uneven, and positioned at varying 
intervals, passage either up or down is quite hazardous.

Atop the Western Side of a Narrow Gorge~
   On an elevated area of rocky ground, the land divides to the 
east to form a steep-sided gorge, through which a river runs 
swiftly westwards. There are a few trees hereabouts, but most of 
the surrounding area is boggy and dotted with shrubs. The sound 
of woodland creatures and birds is faint, mostly drowned out with 
the faint roar of the waters below. A steep, rough stair of rock 
leads eastwards and down into the gorge, and a path winds its way 
in an equally steep, southerly decline.

A Wooden Platform Alongside The Palisade Gate~
   This large wooden platform is set just above the gates, to 
their south. While crude, the platform is quite sturdy. Built 
at just the right height for one to see over the palisade, it 
affords a view of the nearby area. To the east, a large pasture 
spans out beyond the palisaded wall while to the west lies the 
Inn. One may descend from the platform via a ladder, itself 
merely a series of planks secured to the supports.

A Muddy Lond Anorien Near a Small Cluster of Buildings~
   The interlocking cobbles of the Lond Anorien here are still 
muddy as they approach the buildings to the north. To the west 
lies an open plot of land while to the east, a narrow path 
branches off from the main highway, running around a building 
lying northeast of here. To the south, the road continues 
between some fields, bordered on both sides by irrigation 
ditches. Beyond the buildings to the north, an arm of the 
Heledhnen can be seen flowing by. 
   At each corner of this small intersection stands a lamp post
which provides light during evening hours.

separates the orchard from the surrounding countryside. To the 
east is an opening in the fence big enough to accommodate a

A Refurbished Treatment Area~
   This room has been refurbished into a treatment area at some 
point in the past. The walls are paneled with cedar, much the 
same as the rest of the building, same with the ceiling and 
floor. Old and dusty lamps have been set into little alcoves in 
the walls so as to provide light, but seem to have been moved 
from a lower area upon the wall to higher upon hooks to provide a 
soft but bright light in the room if ever lit. A corner of the 
room has been covered by a curtain, behind it set a large stone 
operating table while the rest of the room is filled with cots, 
shelves of supplies covering the walls. There are no windows in 
this room, and the only exit leads south into the main hall.

the wall has been smashed, the shards litering the floor below 
it. A well-furnished and sturdy door has withstood the blaze on 
the ground, laying in tact within the door frame. The various 
furniture that make their home in this room has been sacked and 
overturned, each burnt drawer and door left open or smashed.

Base of an Abandoned Tower~
   An old gate leads into this old tower from the north. The 
floor and walls, once tightly knit stone blocks, are now 
weathered and cracked by time and the elements. Grass has wormed 
its way through the stone foundation in many places, fed by light 
during the day through the holes commonplace in the walls. A 
stone stairwell winds itself up the outer edge of the tower, and 
while at places is crumbling, looks like its capable of 
supporting someone.

blackened piles of wood remain. The walls are barren with scorch 
marks around each pile. The bunk room can easily be seen 
northwards from here while a blackened oak door leads out 
eastward to the yard. Streaked along the floor leading from east 
to west is a dark stain that reflects the light much unlike the 
scorched stone and wood.

A Field Surrounded by a Low Stone Fence~
   This field is fairly large, but not so that it could not be 
worked by a single person. A low stone wall separates the field 
from the surrounding fields and pastures of Anorien. A small 
tree or shrub occasionally rises beyond the wall and a short path 
leads south from the field toward a farmyard and house.

surrounding the adjacent field. The path is muddy and a bit 
rough in spots. To the east, a grouping of buildings extends 
north while a path runs from between them through the fields to

building is here with a fence extending off the west side of it. 
   A few lamp posts are mounted along the pathway, lighting the
area during night hours.

Inside A Ramshackle Old Hut~
   This small hut has a very close and humid atmosphere at most
times, mainly due to the small fireplace situated on the northern
side, and a continual moisture in the rough, semicircular logs
used in the construction of the hut. A creaky door set upon rusty
hinges is set into the southern wall, with a small, glassless
window next to it; a wooden shutter swings round to cover it up.
The floor creaks continually with any weight set upon it, and in
places the warped planks are plagued by rot and chewed by insects.
A tattered rug is lain to cover some of the floor, but it is
mostly hidden by mess of odd tools and wood.

have been taken to straighten or clean them. The house's

   Bordered on all four sides by a wooden fence, this yard has 
been put to a number of purposes. There is a garden on the west 
side, near the house. Once, it boasted myriad beautiful flowers, 
but they have been stomped into the soil now. Next to it is the 
remains of a vegetable patch. They are both slowly recovering. 
There is a small stall against the south fence, obviously meant 
for an animal of some kind, perhaps a cow. All around are the 
woods and hills of Anorien, with plots of land extending around 
this yard, accessible through gaps in the fence. Strangely, 
there is no sound, just a foreboding stillness.

other, holding up what lies overhead. Underfoot, the once white 
stones have been blackened with time, but are free from cracks 
and splits. Iron torch racks have been cleverly spaced about the 
room, offering light to this room, as it has no windows.

The Smokehouse~
   A mix of hand-hewn oak and poplar timbers makes up this cabin, 
with a hand-cut stone foundation. It is well-made, with 
hand-hewn joists that, while primitive, look secure and solid. 
The stone smokepit in the center of the building is constantly 
lit, day and night, with all manner of meats hanging above it 
smoking. A smaller, enclosed smokehouse out back very likely 
holds more; during slaughtering season, smoke is always seen 
filtering through the smaller smokehouse's vents. Canvas-covered 
meats hang all around for sale, with bins and racks of other 
preserved goods. A door leads back out to the path outside.

Before An Old Stone Farmhouse~
   A thin path, made from round cobbles driven into compacted 
soil, leads east and west. To the west it heads straight to the 
front door of a wide, stone farmhouse. The walls are made from 
large stone bricks, and have recently been white-washed, though 
already shades of mud and grime are upon the walls. The path 
turns sharply off to the north half way, heading to a small gap 
between the farmhouse and a large building made from black 
painted wooden beams. Either side of the path grows grass, 
though it is fairly patchy and remains short at all times, often 
turning into pure mud during the winter.

A Stone Farmhouse With A Low Ceiling~
   This farmhouse is made from thick stone, and this has been 
quickly white-washed on every wall. The ceiling is not very 
high, barely higher than a tall man, and across its breadth run 
thick, black wooden supports, in stark contrast to the white 
ceiling. The area is reasonably large, stretching perhaps 15 
yards east to west, and over twice that north to south. In the 
northern wall a small, wood paneled door is set, recently 
varnished a dark brown colour. The floor is made a a hard, grey 
stone, cold to the touch, but a thin rug stretches across most of 
the middle of the farmhouse, brown in colour, with small tassels 
around the edge.

A Small, Stone Walled Kitchen~
   This small kitchen is cramped and hot and stuffy at most times
of the day. The walls here, much like the rest of the farmhouse,
have been roughly white-washed. The ceiling is made from dark
wooden rafters and a white ceiling between the rafters. In the
southern wall a small window has been cut, with two wooden shutters
able to swing out to open it up.

A Thin Cobbled Path Between A Stone Farmhouse and Barn~
   A thin path made from round cobbles varying from brown to 
grey, to slightly green, leads northward and to the south meets a 
similar path. Wide enough for a cart to be pulled through, 
either side it has been hemmed in by a building either side. To 
the west, the whitewashed stone of a farmhouse, complete with 
thatched straw roof. While to the east of the path, a lofty barn 
lies, made from long planks of wood, stained black and 
overlapping horizontally. A small window with a set of shutters 
is in the stone wall of the farmhouse, and in the barns wall sits 
a pair of high doors which open outwards.

A Cobbled Path West Of A Smokehouse~
   This path leads in from the south and to the west it changes 
from being cobbled to being a small dirt track through the large 
fields there. To the east, and only a small distance north of a 
large barn, sits a smokehouse. Made from thick wooden beams 
which have been laid horizontally, the smokehouse has a dark 
wooden door with slightly rusting metal hinges. The horizontal 
beams are set on different levels on each side, allowing them to 
interlock. In the spaces there is a filler of sorts, painted a 
cream colour recently. The roof slopes sharply, with dark tiles, 
some cracked or missing, covering it. At the top of the roof 
there are some slits that allow smoke to escape.

A Wide, Lofty Barn~
   High and generally large, this barn has a permanent smell of 
animals in it. The floor is completely covered in straw, which 
in some places has been brushed out the way to reveal a packed 
dirt floor. There are several stalls which have been constructed 
at the far end, while a ladder has been fixed to one of the 
rafters in the ceiling at the other end, leading to a hayloft. 
   A large, circular window above the double doors allows light
in during the day, while lanterns upon the walls light the barn at
night.

A Small Wooden Smokehouse~
   The inside of this slightly cramped smokehouse has a permanent 
smell of burnt wood and various meats. The floor is little more 
than hard packed dirt, making a narrow path through the center of 
the smokehouse. Either side of the path have been constructed 
racks to lay meat upon, with space underneath to start the fires. 
The ceiling is filled with many hooks from which the meat can be 
hung from. 
   A small window above the door lets light in during the day,
while two lanterns either side of the door provide light at night.

A Large, Fenced Off Field, North Of A Farmhouse~
   A small cobbled path to the east leads to this field, though 
as it enters the field itself it becomes just a dirt packed trail 
crossing the field. The field stretches northward, from the 
walls of a stone farmhouse to the south, and it is hemmed in on 
all sides by a simple fence made from long, roughly cut poles of 
wood which are lined up vertically and held together by wire and 
being rammed into the mud. The grass in this field is reasonably 
short, though it is not even, in some places the mud is visible, 
while in others the grass can grow to shin height. 
   A small pen, constructed roughly of pine wood, is nestled 
among the vegetation.

A Sparse Sleeping Quarters~
   Recently built, this room is an extension from the main 
farmhouse, though is made from the same stone bricks, whitewashed 
quickly to provide a little light to the room. In the eastern 
wall a window has been set, with wooden shutters able to open and 
close to provide light during the day. The floor is roughly 
even, though the stone is cold to a bare foot. The room is very 
simple, and the walls are completely bare.

they do not look like bare stone bricks anymore. There has also 
been a cream coloured paint applied to the walls. The ceiling is 
low, with thick black beams running across its width. A brown 
rug covers most of the floor, which is otherwise cold stone. To 
the north, a small door leads into the rest of the farmhouse, 
while in the eastern wall is a small stone fireplace, providing 
small amounts of warmth to the room, when lit. Brown painted 
shutters cover a window in the western wall.

It is made simply from wooden planks which have been nailed to the 
rafters stretching across the barn, and at the edge of the loft a
small wooden rail has been created. Stacked here is a large

Slippery Rocky Path Above a River~
   The steep trail in the cliff-face levels off into a gentle 
incline, running north and south. Here, the air is slightly less 
damp and the going easier. It is almost to the top of the gorge, 
although rocks still rise higher to the east and west, obscuring 
most of the view of the surrounding countryside. Several, 
resilient shrubs sprout up from cracks and crevasses along the 
path.

Upon a Bridge Over the Heledhnen Tributary~
   A weathered, grey stone bridge rises here, wide enough to bear 
two wagons side by side across its breadth. At either end of the 
bridge stand stout, blocky pillars, marked with faded Tengwar 
symbols. Below, the glassy, clear waters of the tributary stream 
known as Heledhnen cut through the countryside, narrowing off to 
the east. To the south and north the bridge leads into the 
length of a white-cobbled road, a small cluster of buildings 
visible in the latter direction. 
   Brass lanterns are mounted along either side of the bridge
at regular intervals.

Rolling Fields by the Heledhnen Tributary, West of a Road~
   Rocky fields fold here, rising and falling in all directions. 
The land in this portion of Anorien is not as heavily cultivated, 
the soil underfoot hard, and strewn with stone. From a higher 
vantage it is clear that the fields slope downward to meet the 
pebbled banks of the clear tributary known as Heledhnen to the 
north, while to the east they also descend, ending at the edge of 
a broad, cobbled roadway. To the northeast, a cluster of 
buildings are huddled between the northern bank of the tributary, 
and another branch of the Heledhnen that slopes down from the 
mountains. 
   The land rises sharply to the west, where rocky foothills hug 
the foot of the White Mountains. The Heledhnen seems to issue 
from that direction.

Upon Steep Foothills, Near a Waterfall~
   The land of Anorien rises steeply here, the grassy fields 
giving way to the rocky bulk of a strand of lofty foothills. The 
hills hug the base of the mountains here, whose snow-capped peaks 
loom high above to the west, dwarfed only by the heights of 
Mindolluin that are visible to the south. The foothills are 
dotted by brambly vegetation and the occasional knotted tree. At 
the rise of one such hill the scarse vegetation gives way to a 
cave which burrows deeper into the hillside. They flatten to the 
east, where they join with rolling fields before ending at the 
edge of the Lond Anorien visible in the distance. They continue 
to the south, while to the north they end abruptly at a sheer 
drop, where a cascade of clear mountain water pours down from the 
solid slopes nearby. The waterfall thunders into a pool of misty 
water below, the basin opening into a slender tributary stream 
that flows swiftly eastward.

mighty Mount Mindolluin, the last peak in the White Mountain 
Range that spreads through Gondor. Rocky, craggy and 
snow-capped, the mountain is colossal in size, the peak looming 
over everything below and its slopes far too treacherous for any 
attempt to climb or pass them to the west. 
   The mountain side continues to lead to the north and east, 
forming the western border of the Pelennor Fields.
