A Camp in A Dreary Wood Far North of Morannon~
   The camp here is being packed and they prepare to move. All 
around Balchoth Vanguard men and women are busying themselves for 
the final journey. Those twenty or so of the Vanguard chosen to 
proceed first head eastwards to a trail that leads south to 
Morannon.

Within a Spacious Room~
   Walls of rough stone blocks are built up around this chamber, 
enclosed on all sides by the dreary, undecorated material. 
Underfoot, the floor is similarly barren, formed of long stone 
slabs and unadorned. A stone door is set upon the southern 
egress, slightly crooked upon its hinges, while wooden ones are 
set alone the length of the northern and eastern walls.

A Cramped Kitchen~
   This room is not small, but is adequately filled by its 
furnishings to become fairly cramped. It is windowless, the 
walls made of solid stone blocks which are rough to the touch, 
and contain improperly aligned stones amidst their number with 
some regularity, indicating a relatively poor craftsmanship. A 
single door set into the western wall leads out of the room.

A Path Through Piles of Rubble~
   Guessing from the amounts of stone blocks strewn around the 
surrounding area, it would seem there used to be some kind of a 
building here in past. No longer, though. Now, there is only 
the rubble left, and a wide pathway leading through it towards 
the ravine's wall to the north, where a large stone double door 
has been set into the mouth of a cavern.

Within a Musty Cave~
   The walls of this cave are natural, rounded and rough, formed 
of a light-coloured stone. The floor of the cave is relatively 
flat, interrupted only infrequently to give way to a rising 
stalagmite. Random refuse litters the sides of the cavern, 
stinking of rot and decay, but the central pathway leading from 
the southern double door is kept clear and bears marks of 
frequent passage.

An Overhang Above A Pit~
   The cave that lies to the south opens here into a larger 
chamber, uneven walls creating a domed, circular room. This area 
is formed by a wedge-shaped lip leading northwards, its sides 
falling off suddenly into the space below. Rising from the 
ground is an occasional stalagmite, but otherwise, the floor is 
flat and smooth. A wide ramp encircles the eastern wall, 
descending into the pit.

A Pit Below A Wedge-Shaped Overhang~
   Forces of nature have created the uneven walls of this 
spacious, circular chamber, but the floor has been worked smooth 
by some industrious hands. A precarious, wedge-shaped overhang 
can be seen above, its tip reaching well across one third of this 
pit. Even higher, a domed ceiling can be perceived, drowning in 
darkness. A wide ledge rises along the eastern wall, leading to 
the overhang above. The air here is stale and humid, clearly a 
result of an unsatisfactory ventilation. 
   A shallow firepit has been dug out in the middle of the room 
and a rope-enclosed area below the overhang serves as a sparring 
ring.

A Wide, Windowless Hall~
   A wide hall stretches north and south, a line of stone columns 
in the middle providing additional support for the vaulted 
ceiling. Black and dark gray tiles form a decorative flooring 
with their abstract pattern, but not a single tile has been left 
untouched by age - all are at least chipped, some cracked or 
shattered, and several are missing altogether. Walls of black 
blocks enclose the hallway, small alcoves spaced along their 
length. The wall to the east collapsed sometime in the past, a 
gaping opening providing passage into a natural cave beyond.

   A flight of stairs takes up the entirety of the northern end 
of this hallway. Even though there is nothing like a real 
railing left, the smooth stairs are occasionally braced by small 
pillars bearing remnants of aged, faded engravings. Many of 
these pillars are broken or missing altogether. The stone floor 
underfoot is made of black and dark-gray tiles that are cracked 
in places, the alternating colors creating an abstract pattern. 
Walls of dark, age-worn blocks border the sides of this hallway 
as it continues southwards.

Within a Dilapidated Tomb~
   In times long forgotten, this place was doubtless a 
stoneworker's masterpiece. Now it is merely a ruin. The walls 
to either sides bear a few oblong alcoves, probably used as 
sepulchers in past. Now each one of them gapes open and empty. 
Here and there around the room several pedestals are visible, 
suggesting there used to be some statues decorating this room. 
Never more. Only chipped stone boots and ankles stand in one 
corner, the rest of the figure broken off above the knees and 
missing.

gravel and rock, but it is rather compact, curving in a bowl-like

Chamber above a Staircase~
   The most striking feature of this square chamber is the 
non-uniform stonework. The walls to the south and west are made 
of finely-made black stone blocks, worn smooth by age, the 
ceiling over the southwestern corner curving in an arch. The 
rest of the chamber must have collapsed sometime in past, and was 
rebuilt with crudely fashioned boulders of light-colored tufa, 
evidently thrown up in haste with function in mind rather than 
decoration. A rusted iron double-door offers passage northwards, 
while another, much smaller door, leads westwards. There is a 
wide staircase to the south and a short passage branches off to 
the east.

human bones. A singular small doorway leads eastwards, the 
simple arch similar in shape to that of a number of small alcoves 
encircling the chamber. The floor is completely covered with 
many tiny shards of bones, not a single one large enough to be of 
any real use. The ceiling is low, supported with stone ribs.

An Entrance to the Pits~
   The shanty town of the Pits begins here, a motley collection 
of shacks, tents, hovels and a variety of other makeshift 
dwellings huddling against the flimsy palisade to the south. 
There is neither a plan, nor a system to the low buildings, but 
the central roadway of trampled dirt remains wide enough to 
provide easy, if uncomfortable passage for several carts at once. 
   The palisade door here has a small shutter that can be slid to 
offer a view of who is outside.

A Roadway Snaking through the Pits~
   A wide path of trodden dirt stretches south and east from 
here, snaking its way through the piles of refuse and makeshift 
dwellings of the Pits. Patches of cobblestones here and there 
hint that this has been a well-built road ages ago, but most of 
it is gone by now. The similarity between the cobbling and the 
small stones used to build parts of a couple of low, lopsided 
huts by the road tells its own story.

A Covered Section of the Roadway~
   The wide path through the clusters of low shacks and tents 
suddenly curves northwards. The reason for this sudden change in 
direction is a huge pile of dirt and rocks towering to the 
eastern side, although the source of it is nowhere to be seen. 
   Overhead, a patchwork of hides and rags has been stretched out 
as a makeshift roofing, but it would seem ineffective against 
rain. Nevertheless, it provides some shade for this part of the 
stinking, pitiful place that is the Pits.

Through the Pits~
   A sudden gap stands in the steep mountainside to the east, a 
mouth of a wide ravine that cuts sharply through the rock. A 
mammoth gate blocks the entrance. The section of road nearest to 
the solid-looking wall is in far better repair. Alternating 
patches of hard-packed dirt and cobblestones vie for dominance 
over the surface, but the latter seems to be more numerous here. 
Similarly, the shanties and hovels of the Pits seem to grow 
sturdier, some even climbing up a storey or two, encouraged by 
the support of the fortifications. 
   Over the wall, billowing clouds of black smoke rise towards 
the sky.

A Small Square at the Foot of a Huge Gateway~
   Two dark stone wings hang from the massive hinges of an 
enormous gateway to the west. A simple, sturdy and rampartless
wall of similar stone stretches north and south from here until
it reaches the sides of the wide ravine, which encloses the city
as it continues eastwards. 
   To the northern side of this relatively small square sits the 
Great Foundry, resembling a giant lurking spider with its squat,
bulging shape. Pipes of uncertain purpose wrap around the 
building's front, pungent liquid oozing out here and there.
Numerous chimneys spew out stinking, black fumes to pollute the 
air, effectively blotting out the sky constantly. 
   A set of steps leads through a stone archway, leading up to
a keep that rises up overhead the gates.  Busy-looking denizens
of the city move in and out of the enterway of the gates at all
times.

ravine enclosing this part of Egthela. Far to the northeast, the 
ominous presence of the Keep of Abominations juts out of the 
mountain like a giant finger, overseeing the lower portions of 
the fortress from its vantage point.

uninviting and gloomy, with much of the stretch of the lake 
obscured by grimy mist clouds.

Up atop the cliff, some distance eastwards, the dark shape of the 
Spire looms. The air here is thick with the Great Foundry's 
fumes, the squat building riddled with chimneys not too far 
southwest from here. North of here, a narrow trail slips through 
piles of rubble, approaching an opening in the northern wall of 
the ravine.

A Road Carved into a Steep Rock Wall~
   A road cobbled with small uneven stones slowly ascends the 
side of the mountain. The main body of this part of the city is 
clearly visible from this vantage point, thanks to the low height 
of the crude, hastily-built buildings. From west to east, one 
can easily see the outer wall with its huge gate, the squat form 
of the Great Foundry sitting next to it and sending forth black 
fumes towards the sky. Southwards across a winding stream, a 
particularly well-preserved ruin of an ancient house stands, 
bustling with activity at all times of day or night. Further 
still, the opposite side of the ravine slopes sharply upwards.

A Mountainside Road Approaching Ancient Fortifications~
   The ravine bottlenecks here, the road you are standing on 
hugging tight against the northern rock wall, overlooking a 
narrow canal below to the south. An age-worn wall encloses the 
narrow section of the valley, masterfully worked stone blocks 
keeping their shape despite the ravages of time. Further to the 
south, the wall changes into a newer, crudely-built one, 
presumably because the original fortifications gave way to some 
greater forces in that area. A graceful arch houses a wide 
gateway, but the gate that has been set into it looks ugly, thick 
oak boards hammered together and banded with unevenly spaced bars 
of dark iron. 
   Southwards, an ancient stone arch branches off the road. Its 
west-side railing is missing completely, as well as parts of the 
bridge's main body. The bridge approaches the opposite wall of 
the ravine, where a tunnel pierces into the dark rock. 
   Above, stone steps have been carved around a pillar of rock
and rise out of sight up towards a large fortress carved out of
three vertical knuckles of the cliff-side.

The Tanning Vats ~
   Several iron staircases descend towards the channel that runs 
through the centre of this elongated chamber, iron-grille bridges 
spaced evenly across to provide good access to the dark waters, a 
number of large vats suspended above them. There are many of 
these large containers, enough to allow working on many raw hides 
as once. The liquid in the vats was already dirty enough, but 
the liquids and leftovers from the tanning make it even worse, 
turning the slimy, disgusting water dark green, with pools of 
greasy rainbow colors here and there. A surging force pushes the 
water through the channel and plunges down out of sight before 
the pipe disappears under the final vats.

A Road Through the Third Tier~
   The cobbled road slopes upwards to the north, weaving its way 
between the aged buildings. Many of the houses in this part of 
the city are damaged in one way or another, but have been 
repaired and seem to be occupied now. It is eerily quiet here, 
and it seems there are not many citizens living in this area. 
   To the northwest, a cliff's wall rises from the ground, the 
slim shape of the Spire crowning it.

Approaching a Tower's Entrance~
   The ground slopes sharply upwards as the road approaches an 
entrance into the tower that seems to grow out of the rocky side 
of the ravine to the north. The structure is dilapidated, pieces 
of masonry missing altogether, a couple of large cracks 
threatening to collapse the entire building. Yet, there are 
signs of repair here and there, simple, unsightly and utilitarian 
workmanship used to support the crumbling tower. An 
unmistakeable scent of yrch drifts in from the north. 
   Broad steps climb at the very edge of the cliff-face up to the 
walls above. Once it seems they were gated, but the arch and 
twisted metal lays in a rusted pile to one side.

An Underground Chamber Below a Long Staircase~
   You find yourself in a large round chamber, which has its 
walls worked as smooth as the tiled, mosaic floor. To the 
western side of the entrance to the south begins a wide staircase 
which begins its slow ascent ever upwards through the heart of 
the mountain, a spiral that encircles this chamber's perimeter. 
A set of iron bars block passage upwards, and more bars with 
sharp points sticking out of them have been added to discourage 
anyone daring enough to try climb onto the staircase at a 
different point.

A Long Staircase~
   Spiralling through the heart of the mountain, the staircase 
seems to be neverending. It encircles a wide central shaft, 
which allows a good view of the considerable depth below. Each 
step has been carefully shaped out of dark stone, and is now worn 
with time and the feet of many people. There is a landing every 
now and then, a low stone bench on each providing a resting space 
for those who find the ascent or descent too long.

Fourth Tier, Before The Spire.~
   Wind lashes visitors here viciously, a permanent scourge 
threatening to knock anyone from the heights of this small 
plateau. Directly to the north stands the base of the high tower 
known as the Spire, seeming impossibly slender to support all of 
the weight of the upper parts. The Spire is dark gray in colour, 
made of blocks of stone worn smooth by the whipping winds that 
seem to never die up here. It looms above, slim and graceful, 
defiant to the ravages of time. 
   To all other directions, the plateau falls off sharply into 
the ravine below, providing a good vantage point. Southeast, the 
Third tier with its ancient buildings stands, while to the 
southwest is the Second Tier, the squat shape of the Foundry 
concealed by the thick black smoke rising from it.

itself connects to a long tunnel, wrapping round to the south, 
while the exterior portion of the building is built of crooked 
stone blocks. The building is very large indeed, and has a 
significant guard presence.

   Crude. Simple. Hastily-built. These words spring to mind as 
one looks at the scattering of houses surrounding this street. 
The ancient ruins are less frequent here than in the parts that 
are more to the north, and small, squat huts made of wood 
predominate. To the south stands a larger stone building.

The Tannery~
   Several iron staircases descend towards the channel that runs 
through the centre of an elongated chamber, iron-grille bridges 
spaced evenly across to provide good access to the water. The 
liquid in the channel was already dirty enough, but the liquids 
and leftovers from the tanning that is done here make it even 
worse, turning the slimy, disgusting water dark green, with pools 
of greasy rainbow colors here and there. There are many large 
containers, enough to allow working on many raw hides as once.

A Hall Full of Noise~
   A wide, spacious hallway is filled with clamor, various 
denizens of the city passing through in haste, chattering, 
cursing and calling out incessantly. It is also full of stench - 
unwashed bodies, sweat, heat, and hundreds of unrecognisable 
scents mixing together to overwhelm the senses. A few orcs have 
decided to call this place their home, their pitiful nests of 
rags and furs huddling within the darkest corners.At times 
Morlock's deputies will come in and round up those that do not 
scatter in terror, dragging them to the Slums. Overhead, a 
criss-crossing latticework of stairs and walkways spans below the 
ceiling, interwoven with a network of thick iron pipes and 
drowning in clouds of black smoke. 
   Towards the west, the stench grows even worse, while waves of 
heat radiate from the north. Southwards, the iron doors are 
often left open, offering a view of the passersby outside.

Before A Monstrous Lumbering Machine ~
   A set of iron stairs descends into this wide chamber. Sawdust 
and woodchips cover all of the surfaces, the finer dust floating 
in the air and creeping into nostrils and lungs. The force of 
the dark waters rushing through a central canal from east to west 
is used to power a giant machine of dark iron, a monstrous thing 
full of wheels and saw-edged blades. Dark splotches of dried 
blood are splattered here and there, reminding everyone what 
happens to the careless and unwary when operating the lumbermill. 
   Piles of logs, planks and beams have been stacked by the walls 
haphazardly.

The Great Foundry~
   This is the very heart of this building - the foundry itself. 
The heat of this place is near-unbearable, and loud clangs of 
metal striking against metal resonate through the hall, many 
smiths at work at once to arm the numerous warhosts of Mordor. 
The chimneys make a valiant effort at disposing this place of the 
smoke produced by burning coal, but fail in the task, and so the 
whole area is filled with thick rolling smoke, reducing 
visibility.

The Great Market, Western Side~
   A large, elongated house once stood here, but now there is 
nothing but its outer walls left, and even those are in a state 
of disrepair. That didn't stop the denizens of the city from 
throwing up a number of stalls and small shops, created of a 
mismatched collection of wood, hides, rags, and even bones. 
Shouts of merchants peddling their wares mingle with angry cries 
of discontented customers, and the chatter of many individuals 
fills the air. 
   A makeshift roofing of hides and tent-cloth stretches 
overhead.

The Great Market, Eastern Side~
   Partially covered by a makeshift roofing of overlapping hides, 
this place bustles with activity. A marketplace has been built 
inside the walls of a dilapidated building, parts of original 
masonry used to support new stalls and shops. The ground is 
littered with refuse, and the stench of many unwashed bodies 
invades the senses. 
   Northwards is a part of the building which still possesses a 
sound roof, a single doorway leading into it. The marketplace 
continues westwards.

Upon a Crumbling Bridge~
   Time was not merciful to this ancient stone bridge, yet it 
remains standing here, still serving its purpose of providing a 
crossing over the dried riverbed below. The railing to the west 
is missing, as are some portions of the structure, allowing a 
view of a narrow stream approaching a cluster of buildings and a 
massive gate enclosing the mouth of the ravine. On the opposite 
side, stone fortifications bar passage further up into the 
ravine. 
   Walls of the ravine tower over both ends of the bridge, the 
slender shape of the Spire sitting directly to the north.

   A small plateau stands at the foot of a smooth wall of black 
rock to the east, overlooking the scattering of buildings on its

in the distance, clouds of black smoke roiling around it 
menacingly, a large number of chimneys reaching towards the sky 
like limbs of some strange creature.

A Gently Curving Tunnel~
   A wide hallway slips into the depths of the mountain, cold air 
drifting through it. Walls of irregularly sized blocks of stones 
make a long curve eastwards, sconces bearing torches spaced 
evenly along either side. There are several doorways on the 
southwestern side of the tunnel, heavily armored guards standing 
in front of them at all times and giving hard looks to those

leading up towards the ruined bridge visible to the northeast. 
Further up in that direction, atop the opposite mountainside, the 
Spire pierces the sky as a stone dagger's blade. 
   At its lowest, western end, the trail twists northwards to 
slip into the side of a busy-looking ruin of an ancient building 
and a small branch of the trail leads deeper down into the ravine 
where the narrow stream weaves its way.

The Spear's Thrust~
   The insides of an old house have been rebuilt into a spacious 
common room of the establishment known as the Spear's Thrust. 
Half-collapsed walls of what once have been rooms of the building 
serve as means to separate the space into several parts, 
providing a dubious measure of privacy to a table in one dark 
corner. Men and women of every Mordorian race and class mingle 
here; workers, soldiers, members of the Warbands, are all spread 
about the room, seeking refreshment and entertainment provided by 
the beverages served here from behind a rickety bar that sits 
directly opposite to the entrance doorway. Unfortunately, some 
of the patrons have different opinions on what is 'entertaining', 
which results in many a loud argument. Everyone seems oblivious 
to the dirt of this place, the amount of cockroaches scurrying 
along the walls, and the heavy smoke that roils and swirls 
beneath the high ceiling.

   A few planks of low-quality, splintering wood are nailed over 
a lone window leading to the west, rags and dried mud stuffed 
into the numerous gaps between the wood to block off any light 
that might be coming from outside. A compact layer of hard 
packed dirt covers the floor, chipped stone tiles visible 
underneath in several places. In the middle of the room, the 
tiles had been broken and thrown away to give space to a crudely 
built fire-pit.

construction of a merchant's stall that has been wedged in

bear hides stretch overhead, stitched together to form a simple,

A Dingy Gambling Den~
   Within a section of half-collapsed walls, gamblers and 
spectators gather around tables and peer into crates and rickety 
cages, bawling and shouting out their bets and encouragements. 
Fights are frequent, blood is spilt and coins exchange hands. 
Blackbloods mix with other races freely here, all intent on 
winning coin or proving their superior skills. The tavern 
sprawls south of here. 
   A collapsed hole at the north end of the building leads 
downwards into a raucous fighting pit.

A Fighting Pit Beneath the Gambling Den~
   Below the stench of the den, a worse one is here around a 
sizeable fighting pit. Sawdust, blood, bones and worse litter 
the ground. Nailed logs enclose the pit in a low wall. Raised 
above the pitwall are a series of precariously angled 
triple-tiered wooden benches surrounding it with a narrow 
walkway. A short tunnel leads out of the western side of the 
pit, angled steeply upwards into a large dug-out cave. There is 
access into one side of this through a small bolted door near the 
cave wall. This whole place seems to have been dug out of the 
rock beneath the tavern. Steps lead back up to the gamblers. 
   Caged creatures can be often seen behind the iron bars leading 
into the dug-out cave.

Amidst Terraced Fields~
   A number of small, rocky plots of cultured soil descend in a 
sequence of terraces towards Ithilien forests to the west, 
resembling a giant, uneven staircase. The soil seems poor, dry 
and crusty, but despite all that, it seems to be used for growing 
crops, a network of narrow streams containing fetid water used to 
provide the necessary irrigation. 
   A flimsy wooden palisade blocks progress to the east. Beyond 
a ravine rises and noises can be heard on the other side at all 
times of the day and night. Gutteral calls. Iron against iron. 
The scent of fires and smoke drift over the palisade at times.

Terraced Farmland Within A Ravine~
   The ground slopes upwards from west to east, rising from the 
lush Ithilien forests towards a wide valley that slips between 
two summits of the Mountains of Shadow. The land lacks any 
trees, and bears many signs of being used for agriculture despite 
the dusty soil scattered with rocks, which doesn't seem to be too 
rich and healthy. A chaotic network of trenches has been used to 
spread water between small terraced fields, the muddy water in 
them smelling of rot and decay. 
   A flimsy palisade rises to the east and stretches the length 
of the valley walls, while the sounds of raucous voices and 
bestial screeches are clear on the other side.

A Trail Entering a Valley~
   A narrow trail hugs close to the rising rocky massive to the 
south, climbling towards the reinforced palisade barring the 
valley to the east. A wooden gate stands in that direction, a 
partially-covered, walled-off platform above it possibly holding 
a number of defenders of this place. A few spears bearing 
decomposing heads of some humanoid creatures have been staked all 
along the path, their worm-eaten features making it impossible to 
figure out who were their owners.

A Short Tunnel~
   A short tunnel of artificial make runs through the dark rock, 
opening up on either side onto a slope above a valley. The floor 
is uneven, full of cracks, sudden small rises and drops, and the 
walls are supported by crudely hacked beams. There is a strong 
drift, air speeding past and producing moans like a wounded 
animal. 
   A narrow passage branches off northwards.

A Set of Terraced Fields Beneath an Overflowing Pipe ~
   Rocky, poor soil has been used to form several levels of 
fields, rising from south to north like a gigantic, uneven 
staircase. The area is wedged between a massive arm of the 
Mountains of Shadow and a much lower rocky formation to the west, 
narrowing as it approaches a wooden palisade to the south. 
Beyond the palisade a number of thin rivulets of smoke rise 
towards the sky, a clear sign that the place is inhabited. 
   From a pipe above, a great flow of water crashes down onto the 
fields here and gushes away down the gap in the mountains.

Nearing the Outer Palisade~
   The path is lined with makeshift buildings the poorest of the 
city's inhabitants call their homes. Some of these constructions 
are nothing more than holes dug into the ground and covered with 
provisory roofs of branches, straw and soil, others are more 
regular buildings with walls of wood or even stones. Piles of 
trash fill corners of chaotic dead-end alleys, some even blocking 
a wider path that seems to connect a gate in the palisade to the 
north with a larger stone building visible to the east. Fetid 
odor rises from sticky mud underfoot, even the crisp mountain 
wind unable to blow it away. 
   The palisade door here has a small shutter that can be slid
to offer a view of who is outside.

Makeshift Hovels Ringing a Muddy Depression~
   Amidst a ring of primitive huts, a large pit has been dug into 
the sticky, muddy ground, its slopes worn slick and smooth by 
rain and consequent landslides. Some of the crude wooden 
buildings stand close to the edge, leaning over it precariously, 
seeming on verge of collapsing into the crater which is filled 
with fine reddish clay. Several ladders descend into the 
depression, their steps slippery with wetness, allowing access 
for a number of dirt-splattered denizens that are digging the 
soil out of the ground and carrying it away in makeshift baskets. 
   A couple of orcs seem to have succumbed to the clay's firm 
grip, their bony, rotting limbs that are sticking out of the mud 
the only remaining thing that is visible of their corpses.

rocky, only smallest thorned shrubs poking out of the surface

common here than elsewhere in the Pits.

or rain. Broken and sickly, orcs and goblins look out of their 
piles of rags with dull eyes, all spirit seeming to be gone from

occasional moan, scream or a lengthy argument breaking through 
the eerie quiet of this part of the Pits.

more solid, omnipresent mud more or less disappearing under a 
layer of gravel and broken stone. Pieces of cloth, smelly 
rawhides and some pieces of material of unidentifiable origin are 
partly tied and partly sewn together to create a makeshift roof 
stretching above this small yard.

Road Curving Around a Steep Mountainside~
   An arm of a mountain range reaches from the north, the road 
that passes through this area forced to curve around its base. 
The rocky slope is covered with a number of small huts of stones 
and salvaged wood, although access to them requires a sure 
footing due to many loose rocks. 
   West of here the valley widens, slowly sloping downwards and 
into Ithilien. Eastwards, the wall of a fortress enclosing a 
natural ravine can be seen, a huge gateway set into its outer 
wall, enshrouded in clouds of heavy smoke. To the northeast, 
behind the fortifications, a slender shape of a tower juts out of 
the mountainside.

Spire can be seen towering above the fortified ravine below.

it has banks that slope slowly towards the water, the edges 
ringed with a treacherously deep mud. Still, forced by need due 
to lack of space, the dwellers of the city were daring enough to 
throw up several crooked huts at the fringes of the lake, 
supported by wooden pillars serving as stilts, a network of 
rickety walkways of wood and ropes interconnecting them. 
   The stench of this place is eye-watering, though recent 
activity has risen the water level it seems. Only an occasional 
gust of wind bringing relief in form of fresh air. The orkish 
inhabitants of this place seem accustomed to it, though, and 
don't appear to be troubled at all. 
   A wide tunnel has been dug into the northern mountainside, 
raised slightly above the lake.

Passing a Heap of Dirt and Rocks~
   A muddy path strewn with pebbles curves around the 
southwestern side of a large heap of dirt and stones, connecting 
the main road with a tunnel that punches into the rock massive to 
the south a little further up the slope. The path climbs towards 
the opening in a number of twists. Worn-looking orcs move in and 
out of the tunnel, those coming out bending under the weight of 
pieces of rock they carry in handcarts, baskets, bags, or other 
makeshift containers. Some of these rocks end up on the heap, 
while others are carried further into the city.

An Underground Tunnel, Crudely Hacked~
   A wide tunnel cuts into the mountainside, stinking with urine 
and sweat of many orkish labourers passing through it, the ones 
coming from the south carrying away pieces of dark rock. The 
walls, bearing many pick-marks, are supported by crudely-worked 
logs of wood at irregular intervals. The lumber creaks softly 
from time to time, protesting against the weight of all the earth 
it must hold back, and dirt trickles from the ceiling here and 
there.

An Underground Mining Area~
   A wide cavern has been mined out of the dark rock, crude 
wooden girders and pillars used to provide dubious support for 
the uneven ceiling. The space resonates with the sound of many 
picks striking at the walls, a number of denizens of the city 
laboring hard to wrestle pieces of rock and ore from the 
mountain's grasp. The air here is thick with smoke coming from a 
number of lanterns casting patches of flickering light onto the 
surroundings, but a faint breeze can be felt, a drift headed 
towards the northern tunnel. 
   A ramp descends deeper underground from here, wide enough for 
several orcs to pass at once.

A Steep Rocky Slope~
   A narrow trail zigzags across the steep incline, snaking its 
way between large boulders, potholes and cracks in the rock. Up 
above, it enters a narrow tunnel. Below, there is a dark pool of 
a roughly circular shape, a few huts on stilts at its muddy 
banks. Further eastwards, a ravine interrupts the solid wall of 
the opposite side of the valley, its mouth enclosed with a sturdy 
stone wall. Low-hanging clouds of black smoke roil above the 
fortifications. 
   The slender shape of the Spire rises from the mountainside 
above the ravine, a giant's finger pointing at the sky.

Within a Circular Room Drowning in Shadows~
   A circular chamber is nested within the dark rock of the 
mountain, its walls smooth and bearing several sets of iron 
manacles, their iron chains looped through massive rings attached 
firmly to the walls. Interspersed with the manacles are cages of 
varying sizes and states of disrepair. Some of the cages have 
spikes that face inwards to keep whatever is being held captive 
away from the bars. To the east and west lay barred doors that 
are heavily reinforced. Several torches sit in sconces around 
the room, but their flickering reddish glow doesn't quite manage 
to chase away the darkness of underground. A small fireplace 
sitting by the northern wall would not cast too much light 
either, and seems too small a source of heat to make the cold, 
damp air any warmer. Several vicious-looking lengths of iron are 
stored next to the fireplace, brands similar to the ones used to 
mark cattle.

A Modest Dwelling~
   A small chamber is nested among smooth walls of dark rock. 
There is a lantern hanging from the flat ceiling in the middle of 
the room, low enough to be easily manipulated. The floor is 
tiled with slabs of the same stone the walls have been hewn out 
of. A deep, small window is set in the southern wall, allowing a 
scant amount of light seep in during daytime and providing fresh 
air for the inhabitant of this spartan dwelling.

   Tiles of black stone form the floor of this small rectangular 
chamber, a few of them cracked but most seeming intact. The 
walls to all directions but south have been carved directly out 
of the rock. Southwards, a wall was built with use of blocks of 
the same dark gray mineral that encloses the room. A small 
window sits high in the wall, allowing daylight in. 
   A large desk sits in the middle of the room, a few stubs of 
candles ringing its scarred, dark-stained tabletop.

   Large in size and scale, this cell seems to be meant for 
something far larger than man-size. Its walls are smooth, gouged 
in many places as if by claws. Flakes of what look to be 
fingernails stick out of the stone in places as if someone had 
attempted to claw their way through the thick rock. There are no 
windows, no ways to see the outside world just four stone walls 
and a ceiling far above.

A Dank Stone Kitchen~
   Stuffed away at the end of the cave, this room exists at the 
end of the hall only due to the makeshift wall of wooden planks 
that has been installed to the east. The poorly-lit room is 
cramped, with all morsels stored away in shelves contributing to 
the smell that can be described as a mixture of spice and fire. 
A single lantern hangs from a rusty iron staple hammered into the 
roof above. A couple of crypt-like beds have been carved into 
the western wall, lined with straw for a mild amount of comfort. 
A relatively cool stream of water trickles down the wall here, 
the stone beneath it stained a dark hue.

   Nested deep within the ravine, this area is shadowed by the 
high rock cliffs to the north and south even during broad 
daylight. A flat area spreads on the southern bank of a narrow 
stream that is full of filthy, muddy water, punctuated by the 
crumbling pillars of an aged stone bridge spanning overhead. 
   There are several ragged targets made of burlap and straw set 
up to the eastern side of the area where a tall wall of dark rock 
rises to cut off the ravine at its narrowest spot from whatever 
lies beyond. A number of broken bolts and arrows litter the 
ground and a few larger boulders have been set out to serve as 
distance markers.

hacked out of the earth's unyielding innards. A narrow staircase 
leads up from one corner, its steps sagging from years of use. 
There are piles of refuse lining the sides, producing an 
unpleasant odor. 
   One of the walls has been broken through, a craggy, uneven 
tunnel continuing in that direction.

jagged entrance opens into a small chamber. Light of many fires 
can be seen eastwards and the chaotic chatter of orcs intensifies 
when one moves in that direction.

raggedy orcs of smaller size. The reddish glow intensifies to 
the southeast and a huge pyre can be seen in that direction. 
   There is a large depression in the cavern floor here, wide 
stairs leading down into it. Shouts and jeers resound from

Nearing a Foul-Smelling Underground Stream~
   An overwhelming stench lingers in this underground passage, a 
deathly mixture of rot, sewage and refuse from tanning along with 
hundreds of other, undescribable scents. The source of this 
unbelievable smell is a narrow stream blocking off progress to 
the north. The thick, viscous liquid in it moves sluggishly from 
east to west, bearing many bits of thrash along with it: from 
pieces of rags to small dead animals to small chunks of wood and 
other things inhabitants of the fortress above deemed not useful 
anymore. 
   Several orcs of the smallest breeds reside here, scanning the 
channel, scavenging for anything they could use to improve their 
miserable lives.

   A set of rock platforms on either side of a crack running

of the crevice with the tunnels below. It is a laborious climb, 
but would be much more complicated if there weren't steps carved 
into the rock and wooden ladders to make it easier to move from 
one stretch of flat stone to another. Faint drift can be felt, 
air breezing through, but it is too weak to chase away the 
terrible stench wafting in from below.

just pass through in pursuit of some unknown task. Westwards, a 
ledge runs high along the uneven, curving wall, a few rickety 
ladders providing access to it.

terraces of light-colored rock. A number of ladders, ropes and

ceiling grows darker towards the northern side, stained heavily 
by soot and grime produced by the fireplace and oven that occupy 
the entire wall. A narrow bed sits to one side of the room, a 
small stool beside it covered with dropping layers of wax and 
stubs of candles. The opposite side of the wall is taken by a 
chaotic set of wooden shelves, their contents contributing to the 
spicy, aromatic smell of the kitchen.

A Short, Torch-lit Passage~
   Two massive sconces of dark iron protrude from the southern 
wall, the torches set into them casting their flickering light 
into the area. Three doorways have been set into the rock walls, 
each of them blocked with sturdy door or iron bars sporting 
massive locks. This place reeks of decay and human misery. 
   The short stub of this passage opens to the east into a large 
room.

A Small, Dark Cell~
   A rank smell of rot rises from a heap of rotten straw and rags 
to one side of this small, gloomy room. The pile is clearly 
meant as a bedding for whoever is condemned to the unfortunate 
fate of dwelling here, and there is no other furniture in the 
room save a single dirty bucket in one corner, a poor replacement 
for a chamberpot. Scant light seeps in through a small window in 
the sturdy door, crisscrossed with solid iron bars. Dark stains 
line the walls in wild spatters, looking suspiciously alike to 
dried blood.

   Claustrophobic, windowless and filled with malodor, this tiny 
rooms is not a comfortable place to dwell in. Flickering, 
reddish glow of torches seeps in through a small iron-barred 
window in the single sturdy door leading out. A scattering of 
dingy, rotting straw covers the floor and a low stone slab 
serving as a bed. A stench of urine and feces emits from one 
corner where a dirty wooden bucket sits.

A Wide Gently Ascending Ramp Between Rising Walls~
   The overbearing height of the defensive walls spanning this 
fortified vale are ever present here, casting this cracked path 
in shadow. Worn heads of kings of an older time sit comfortably 
on stone plinths above the arched gates to the south most, having 
lost ears or noses, still glaring unwaveringly onto the comers 
and goers of the tower. Harsh winds whistle through this 
approach from the rising cliff face above, which ascends 
impressively revealing the carved out tower with its windows and 
dark facets. 
   On the eastern side of this ramp, a great collapse of rock has 
torn a gash vertically down and a small descent leads to the 
lapping waters of the Dead Pond.

A Cloistered Courtyard at the Foot of a Vast Tower~
   This cloistered courtyard is constantly a hub of activity, 
even when the pale sun has set. Blackbloods and other visitors 
frequently pass through the portcullis, scrutinised by the guards 
on duty. Poorly dressed snaga use this area to wander about with 
any free time they might have, watching the goings on from the 
gloomy cloisters. It is impossible to ignore the staggering 
height and overbearing nature of the jagged tower rising up to 
the east with the mountains, forever casting the courtyard into 
shadow. 
   A small shutter has been set to one side of the portcullis and 
can be slid to one side to gift a view of the path outside.

   This cloistered courtyard is constantly a hub of activity,

tower rising up to the east with the mountains, forever casting 
the courtyard into shadow. 

Now the sun has set, the courtyard has a calm quiet about it and 
the activities people partake in. Carts and wagons still come 
and go, but not as frequently. Torches sit sputtering in their 
iron sconces, casting pale orange light on the surroundings.

A Spacious Stable Area, Strewn with Hay~
   Long rows of wooden stables stretch to the left and right upon 
entry here, most of them occupied constantly with barking and 
howling wargs of various girth. In the far west corner of the 
room is a stack of cupboards and shelves with various equipment 
stored haphazardly. In the eastern central floor is a trapdoor. 
Bow-legged goblins and small, maggoty-skinned orcs, range up and 
down, carrying raw meat, brooms and straw. The stench of wet 
fur, blood and dung hangs heavy in the air.

A Cramped Tunnel Beneath the Stables~
   Strong scents of hay and warg dung settle heavily here as they 
seep through the cracks in the trapdoor's hinges above. Three 
sturdy walls of carefully carved blocks of black stone form a 
pillar of support to the stables above, as well as the beginnings 
of a tunnel eastwards, where the ground gently slopes down 
beneath a low slated ceiling. Narrow steps lead up to the 
trapdoor. Lantern sconces placed at even distances are rarely 
filled or lit, judging by the lack of smoke stains.

A Damp Tunnel Intersection Beneath the Tower~
   A cool draught carries the scent of stables from off to the 
west where the flat slabs forming the floor of this tunnel rise 
upward. The black rock blocks forming the walls of the passage 
are impressive in their size and sheen, taking the glow of 
lantern or torch and forming deep glowing dancing figures that 
follow the light. A sharp turn southwards offers further access 
under the mountain fortress, while set into the northern wall a 
narrow oak door strapped with iron betrays a sense of the age of 
this place, the vertical beams set with multitudes of tiny holes 
and rot. Above, a hatchway betrays the tomb-like silence by 
allowing in the sound of pots and pans clashing. A long-dried 
trickle of sticky liquid sets its downward path behind the 
vertical ladder which leads up.

A Cobwebbed Dormitory~
   Though barely furnished and seemingly a quiet and subdued 
chamber, more than anything this low-ceilinged, rectangular 
dormitory is airless. Quiet dust motes hang lazily as spiders 
forlornly cast their webs into the darkest corners. An oak door 
set in the southern wall seems only to hold together due to the 
iron bands strapping it to the rusting hinges. Oppressive and 
weighty, the mountain fortress seems to push down upon this 
place. The cold slabs walked upon by all here are often marred 
with deep gashes and along the eastern wall long cracks converge 
around a central point, as if great force was applied there.

   The passage continues uniformly north and south here, an 
eastern doorway showing recent repair, as the pine timbers 
hastily formed into a crude rectangle and set on hinges testify 
to. Where the black rock passes at waist height on the western 
wall, careful inspection reveals a large white tree displayed 
against a dark blue background, seven stars placed around it. 
The air is damp and cloying here, with a small breeze at foot 
level running the length of the tunnel.

An Abandoned Kitchen Area~
   Here the grim silence that seems to press upon this fortress 
has returned, where once these kitchens were filled with life. 
With many benches and tables, fireplaces and hearths, abandoned 
trays and platters, the chamber feels constantly crowded even 
with a few in here. A trapdoor below leads to the tunnels and is 
one of many spots on the floor covered in recently spilled 
liquids. Repaired wooden steps creak under the weight of any 
passing up or down.

A Damp Tunnel Beneath the Tower Leading North and East~
   While the tunnel proceeds in its steady march north and 
eastwards and the low ceiling offers a surprise for the unwary or 
careless, the uniformity ends suddenly when looking below. The 
stone slabs end and are replaced with a large section of crossing 
iron bars, set firmly into the tunnel floor. Though rusted in 
part, they are each as thick as a man's arm. Though a cold 
breeze floods in from the east, the chill of the rock mixes 
uncomfortably with sweat and fear below. A single grill with a 
large bolt lock offers access below down a simple, sturdy iron 
ladder.

A Damp Tunnel Beneath the Tower at a Trapdoor~
   Two sturdy walls of carefully carved blocks of black stone 
form the beginning of a tunnel leading westwards. The eastern 
wall though is unfinished and simply a jagged section of the 
rising cliff. It has been worked to some degreee, as narrow 
stone steps have been carved to offer ascent to an iron hatch 
above, streaked with rust. Fresh air feeds down as does signs of 
rainwater and moss, making these steps slippery, though the scent 
of plants is welcome against the musty tunnel.

A Shadowed Garden at the Foot of the Tower~
   This is no more that a crevice of shelter from the wind and 
worst of the elements behind the fortress. A high stone wall 
runs north to south until it meets the side of the mountain 
curving around to form a rough semicircle of gradually 
overhanging rock. The small space here is constantly being 
dripped on from rivulets of water streaming down the 
mountainside. Grass grows here and soil has clearly been moved 
here in some quantity. There is no floor as such, simply the 
rocks and fortuitious flat rocks before the black cliff-face 
rises away.

A Damp, Shadowy Communal Area~
   Through a pine door barely well enough constructed to hold 
together, the interior of this square chamber could not be more 
of a contrast. Great care was taken when the rocks were placed 
and polished, as revealed by the exact dimensions of this place 
clear even on a casual glance. A single candleabra with eight 
boughs of rusted leaves hangs decaying and useless down from the 
central point of the ceiling. While some effort has been made to 
cheer this place up with tables and scattered cloths, it has 
little impact against the cold stare of the deep shadows, 
glowering and flickering against the light cast by a single lamp 
as a breeze under the door flickers the wick constantly.

   High walls of rough rock reveal that this large chamber is 
nothing more than a rudely cleared hole in the mountainside. 
Thick iron bars criss-cross overhead in the northernmost section 
of the slave pens, with a ladder leading to a hatch, the only way 
out of this place. Several lines of small holes the width of a 
hand are set in the northwestern rock floor near the wall, 
clearly marked as latrines by the stench and excrement around 
them. Discarded shattered pottery and a smattering of bones are 
all the decoration here as the slaves shuffle in the darkness 
whenever they are left alone.

An Ancient Foyer at the Base of the Tower~
   Once no doubt a place of light and glory, hundreds of year of 
neglect lend this high chamber a sense of decay which the many 
lanterns hanging from stone sconces do little to dismiss. 
Clearly an entrance hall of sorts, stone steps lead down from 
each doorway into a chequered floor of white and black slabs, 
carefully cut to form perfect squares. Above, the flat ceiling 
has been decorated with a carefully edged silver script, set at 
the eastern tip glistening two short words in some form of 
ancient script. The walls once boasted murals perhaps, but now 
are faded and cracked plaster, exposing the plain black slabs 
behind them. Those who spend time here often feel they hear 
themselves breathe, at the very least seeking the freshness of 
the courtyard to the west. A wide staircase rises in the 
southeast corner of this chamber, leading up and out of sight.

A Spacious, Cobwebbed Foyer~
   Proud stone arches rise from each corner of this high chamber 
to meet in the center of the flat black stone ceiling. Here, 
with startling contrast, they touch the edges of a large embossed 
white stone shield. Six silver stars shine out under lantern 
light, set in a crescent meeting a larger shape in the middle, a 
helm of sorts, hard to make out from the floor. Two engraved 
six-sided pillars stand between the southern wall and a northern 
door, which is reached by ascending three arcing wide steps. 
Finally, long low stone benches stretch against the east and west 
wall. Dust sits heavy on the rising arches and ancient cobwebs 
flutter useless from the ceiling. Somewhere the sound of water 
dripping can be heard, but it is dull and distant, persistent and 
mournful.

A Cracked Path Leading Around the Base of the Tower~
   Pressed by the rising tower wall to the north and the striated 
black rock of the mountains to the south and east, this small 
path is an oppressive trail between a forlorn attempt at taming 
the Ephel Duath. While the streaks of water trails stain the 
crags and outcrops southwards, to the east the trail turns, 
blocked by a further section of stone blocks overhung by the 
rising natural barrier.

   What must seem from below as a narrow ledge turns out to be a 
wider plateau that stretches further westwards from its edge. 
Rags and half-rotten furs are piled around the wall, a crude 
bedding for the orcish slummers who decided to call this high 
perch their home. 
   A couple of rickety ladders offer a way down into the main 
cavern that can be overseen from up here, orcs milling down below 
among a number of small fires.

A Wide, Cobwebbed Preparation Room~
   Unlike the bold designs of other chambers in this sprawling 
tower, this room of cold dark rock blocks was granted no 
embellishments when designed, or perhaps was abandoned before 
they could be begun. Stretching northwards further than the 
kitchen below, some thought has been given to its apparent 
purpose, as stone benches stretch from end to end pointing at the 
southern doorway. Clearly this is the room from which food was 
once taken and served throughout the tower. The ceiling is just 
high enough to avoid damage to the tall, but with this comes an 
oppression that is only exacerbated by the dust that lines the 
walls and floor.

A High-Vaulted, Cobwebbed Reception Lounge~
  A set of wide and well-repaired wooden steps lead down to the 
entrance foyer of the tower. Here they rise in the center of the 
room and on three sides a bannister of southern hardwood rescue 
the unwary. This large reception room rises up to impressive 
heights, great stone vaulting arches holding up the weight of the 
mountain, though little can be seen of the ceiling with the low 
hanging of the lantern. Footsteps echo on the wide black slabs 
of rock and the chill of the mountain battles with two great 
fireplaces set into the eastern wall. A wide archway leads 
westwards, its rim lined with faded engravings of horsemen 
pursuing chariots. Similarly, the decayed paintings remaining on 
the other walls and tatters of tapestries lend an air of military 
glory long gone. One better-preserved painting on a panel along 
the northern wall has been scratched and marred but reveals on 
closer inspection a King of Gondor, crowned with sword aloft, 
standing over a prone figure of a dark easterling, a chariot 
wheel crushing him and horsemen hailing the king from afar. The 
grandeur of this chamber is somewhat lessened by the frequent 
shouts and calls through the northern doors echoing up from the 
kitchens. 

  A small OOC #4sign#0 is here.

cities and the empires long ago crushed by the Men of the West 
under their bastard kings of dubious bloodline and merit. The 
vertical map reveals a time when Gondor was mightier, if it can 
be believed. Harad is noted, though most of it would appear in 
the floor below here. Mordor seems disputed, with Morannon 
marked as a Gondorian fortress. Even here, the Spire is noted, a 
golden crown engraving marking it with pride. There are crossed 
swords in several places, notably in North Ithilien and at the 
border with Harad. A strange shape of a chariot half sunk 
appears over the Dead Marshes. Apart from the map, this chamber 
is surrounded by repaired shelves and tables are set here. There 
are narrow arched doors set into the north and south walls and a 
cold breeze rattles them constantly.

A Wooden Archer Box~
   This is an exposed outcropping of rock, carefully ballustraded 
with a shoulder high wall, the gaps for archers gifting a clear 
view to the north of the opposite tower's narrow windows and 
bridges of stone. Below, the defensive wall across the first 
level of the fortress stretches, small figures of orcs clear from 
here, fifty feet above. Clearly this position is ripe for 
archers seeking to sweep the walls should they be taken. Exposed 
to the wind and seasons, water pools on the rock floor and moss 
and ivy cling to the outer and inner walls. A small narrow 
arched door leads back into the map room. A shoulder of the 
mountainside blocks further view to the left, though below to the 
right of the walls activity and industry is evident at all times 
of day and night, the funnels of the forges spewing black clouds 
high into the ravine where the high winds sweep it away.

A Wooden Archer Box~
   Where once was set a covered tower in the side of the 
mountain, no doubt offering archer slits and protection from the 
elements, now there is a ruined low wall and a precarious drop 
below onto the marketplace. Above, a huge slice of rock has been 
shrugged free of the cliffs and sits trapped by a bulge in the 
mountainside to threaten overhead. A narrow doorway set into the 
tower wall to the south grants shelter. Directly below as the 
archer leans is a view of the first tier of the fortress. 
Clearly this is set some distance right of the main entrance. 
Soot and smoke rises from the forges and metalworks below, 
obscuring a clear view of the opposite tower.

An Abandoned Shadowy Seating Area~
   Spread over almost the entire floor of this level, the bar and 
its main seating spreads out to the west, behind which are wooden 
walls - the only means of passage through is a lengthy red 
curtain, torn and shredded. In the eastern half of this floor is 
more sporadic seating where blackbloods lounge back abusing each 
other, and the landing to the floor below.

   The atmosphere in this rather large bar and seating area is 
buzzing and excited, completely contrasted with the ancient and 
gloomy settings of this old tower. Spread nearly over the entire 
floor of this level, the bar and its main seating spreads out to 
the west, behind which are wooden walls - the only means of 
passage through is a lengthy red curtain. In the eastern half of 
this floor is more sporadic seating where some individuals
quietly murmur with one another in privacy, and the landing to 
the floor below. Traffic to the east is frequent - miners, 
loggers, tinkers and peddlers all making use of the rooms beyond. 
 
As night has set, the atmosphere on this floor has become more 
alive with all manner of individuals passing through to indulge 
in drinking, gambling and women. Only sputtering torches provide 
light to the room now, save for the higher cobwebbed vaults which 
remain in darkness.

   Simply an extension of the seating area to the east, this 
space is separated by a long, thick velvet curtain, dirty and 
slashed, along with a wooden partition. Small shelves and holes 
in the wall suggest this place once held much of value. Doorways 
that led to private chambers have been knocked away along with 
the walls to expand the size of this place. A faint scent of 
incense remains here.

A Damaged Chamber~
   This small room once boasted a decorative pillar at the 
southern end set in a basin. However, half the length of the 
circular feature is now missing, sheared off, and what remains is 
tarnished and marked, leaving only a small trace of embossed 
pictures of hunting hounds. The basin is filled with stagnant 
water and dust and the wall surrounding it is cracked. A lamp 
maintains an attempt to brighten the room, supported by bright 
plump cushions scattered throughout upon thick rugs. Incense 
drifts above those who may lay here.

   In one of the smaller wings of this floor, a lengthy storeroom 
spreads out, filled with all manner of shelves, storage 
cupboards, chests and trunks. There is some order to the 
madness, many areas sectioned off for particular uses - a 
cobblers workbench in the far eastern corner and a carpenter's 
workbench and tool rack to the west. Branching from this 
storeroom are thin corridors to the north and south. From the 
east, winds usually howl through the door, blowing hung tunics 
and aprons on their pegs.

A Windy Mountain Path Through Jagged Peaks~
   This cracked and dusty path has been hacked through the jagged 
mountainside with much effort, winding its way from the vast 
tower to the west deeper into the mountain range to the east. 
Little of the pale sun reaches these areas, so torches have been 
fastened in sconces to the black rock walls. Fierce winds blow 
through here frequently, howling as they go with clouds of dust.

A Windy Mountain Path through Craggy Rock~
   Fierce winds batter constantly at all visitors to this trail 
set back against the harsh and unforgiving Mountains of Shadows. 
Westwards beckons a mighty fortress of black rock carved out of 
the ravine and the trail has been clearly forced to this point. 
However, here the narrow gap, dark and sheltered from above, is a 
natural fissure between ages, created when Mordor shuddered or 
stretched. Winding southwards, that way is narrower still, 
offering passage in single file only. Staring up, bats can be 
seen in the dark crannies and nooks of the crags.

   A gale sweeps through here, setting any banners or cloaks 
fluttering fiercely and whipping up dust and pebbles to lash and 
blind. The gap here is narrow enough for a single person as it 
leads northwards to a wider, darker trail and eastwards to a far 
brighter and more expansive clearing. The ground is unsteady 
with rocks and sharp cracks zig zagging as if stretched, the wind 
complaining as loudly as they might.

At a Wide Clearing in the Mountainside~
   This basin in the mountains is of surprising girth, stretching 
in a rough semi-circle the length of a hall. Surrounded on all 
sides by the groaning rough walls of the black mountains as it 
is, still there is more light here than within the trail to the 
west as a rim of rock leaves an opening for the sun, should it 
dare appear here. The basin is smooth and declines a little 
towards the center, offering a perfect gathering place. Many 
blackblood and Warband banners flutter violently here against the 
howling of the winds. Benches have been set around the wide rim, 
secured with brackets sunk into the rock.

wooden door is set at the base of the steps facing westwards, a 
recent repair judging by the poor workmanship.

A Small Dusty Chamber~
   Cramped and decrepit, this small stone room has a high ceiling 
but little room to stretch, though that seems the primary 
function of those who come here. A large mattress lays upon a 
sturdy pine bedframe, stained and grimy in places. A single lamp 
hanging from a hook in the ceiling illuminates the activities 
below, casting flattering shadows. The small pine door is poorly 
made and a cold channel of air circles the stone slabs.

A Huge Arched Hall With Uneven Walls~
   Dust hangs in the air high overhead, where the black rock of 
the mountains have been smoothed and carved on the western wall 
and parts of the north and south. This place is enormous, taking 
advantage of a massive natural cave jutting out from the ravine 
and transforming it into this impressive hall. From the 
southeastern edge where steps lead down to the lower levels of 
the fortress, a double row of eight huge white stone pillars 
begin and stretch westwards across the length of this place, 
growing stone roots into the ground and meet the arching natural 
ceiling with branches and silver leaves so large and so high it 
seems improbable that the makers were less than giants, for truly 
one would fit comfortably between them. Great beams of lights 
lance like the rays of the sun from above, caused it seems by 
enormous oil saucers and curved mirrors cleverly positioned. 
Each pool of light on the smoothed rock floor below illuminates a 
carved and embellished circle of silver, within which a multitude 
of battle scenes shine out. Heavy Gondorian cavalry meet charges 
of Haradrim in one, while in another a great meeting of ships see 
the sinking of Corsair banners. While a dozen of these have been 
carefully finished on the western side, the final score are left 
empty and indeed the further towards the rough eastern cave wall, 
the clearer it becomes this place was never completed before 
construction was abandoned. In contrast, the western cave wall 
has been transformed by a dozen semi-circular beams of stone that 
stretch up to the roof and hold a silver and steel mesh of 
branches and leaves giving the impression of fresh growth. Great 
doors are set in all directions and huge fireplaces do their best 
to encourage this place to shake free of the chill of the 
mountains. The hall echoes the voices and footsteps and clatter 
of life here and merges them, a movement of sound that can cause 
snatches of conversation and raucous laughter to pass from one 
end to the other.

A High-Vaulted Barracks~
   A great iron-studded oaken door sits strong and ancient in 
huge hinges set in the southern rock wall. Its frame is 
embellished with faded silver leaves and is perhaps the only 
truly completed area of this barracks. While stone beams rise in 
arches across the width of this large chamber as it pushes 
northwards, they are unfinished and plain and the further from 
the doorway, the poorer the finish. So much so that the far wall 
is a streaked and crystallised inclining cave wall. Lamps hang 
from the beams and torches are set in the occasional sconce. 
Multiple bunks and beds run the length of this place, with tables 
and chairs at the far end. Candles have been melted to fix in 
position all over the cave wall, sending out glistens and rare 
lights that cast a strange rainbow of shadows over the surfaces. 
   Many blackbloods live here, their equipment piled everywhere. 
Constantly busy, this room is never left unoccupied and there are 
always some awake and watching.

A Gloomy Circular Office~
   A single fireplace sprawls like a spent hound around a buckle 
in the eastern wall, constantly crackling and giving out warmth 
that is never enough to remove the chill. Though impressive in 
breadth, the chamber dips quickly eastwards. The walls are 
polished smooth and bear a series of ancient insignia in sunken 
silver. A great table has been set in the middle of this 
circular room and a series of comfortable furniture and desks 
grant some privacy. All that separates this room from the hall 
to the west is a small entrance usually covered by a thick red 
curtain. A small door of a dark-stained rock sits in the 
southern wall, some cracks running across its surface.

   Of black rock polished to a sheen, this square chamber is

A Lengthy, Shadowy Armoury~
   In contrast to the grandeur and majesty of the arched hall, 
this is a large and very plain chamber set with heavy black stone 
blocks. Great shelves of stained oak remain here from long ago, 
though many are collapsed. Armor stands are too faded and weak 
to be used now, as is the case with the few scattered remnants of 
weapon hilts and arrow tips. The Armory has been freshly 
repaired to an extent and the original design has been faithfully 
observed - the central shelves and tables are surrounded by a 
wide pathway that leads without obstruction all about it, so that 
the arched doorways can be reached quickly. High winds rattle 
all the doors except to the east.

A Breezy Training Hall~
   Cracks in the southern wall seem to lead to the outside world 
judging by strong draughts flooding this large rectangular 
chamber. Broad black slabs mostly line the walls except where 
the cavern ran straight enough. In these places a cursory 
attempt at smoothing the surfaces does little more than 
illuminate the streaks and veins of the ancient bones of the 
mountain, probably best left to sleep. This wide and deep 
chamber is of modest height, though it can fit in a climbing wall 
and much equipment here. A sparring area has been cleared near 
the eastern wall, while down the western side a channel of iron 
grills block off a long archer practice area, wide enough for 
several to train at once. The arched doorway set in the northern 
wall is crowned by a seven pointed star etched in silver, dusty 
and faded.

A Damp, Vine-Entangled Corridor~
   Ascending from below into this corridor, one is instantly 
aware of a change in the air. Damp though this place may be, the 
air is fresh and carries the unlikely scent of vegetation with 
it, sometimes an occasional breeze can even be felt along this 
corridor, in vast contrast to the stale damp of the rest of this 
place. The source of this change is soon evident as one 
progresses further along the corridor, where much of the walls 
and floor have been overtaken by mosses and various vines, rare 
flowers filling the area with a delicate scent. To the west the 
corridor opens out into a large atrium while to the north, a 
woodworm infested door stands tightly closed.

   Wooden fences enclosing this small plateau were obviously 
built without much care about how pleasant would the result be 
for an onlooker's eye. Wooden planks are crudely nailed 
together, none of them enitrely narrow or attached in the same 
angle as the next one, built only with function in mind and no 
sense of aesthetics. At the southern side of the plateau more 
fences were built in a similar manner, this time of blocks of 
stone, enclosing a smaller area where boars are held. Next to 
it, a pit was dug out of the hard soil; scattered pieces of 
bleached bone and stains of dried blood covering its bottom and 
walls suggest this is a place of slaughter.

part of the mountain that looms above to the north, a vista of 
the pitiful shantytown of the Pits opening to all other 
directions, from the palisades above Ithilien to the west, to the 
fortified ravine and the slender shape of the Spire on the 
opposite mountainside eastwards.

Grudd's Bows, Bolts, and Bludz~

roof a set of overlapping planks hammered crudely together. The 
walls are lined with pegs that have either been driven through 
old wooden boards, or simply placed through one of the numerous 
punched out knot-holes in the stone. From the pegs hang bows and 
crossbows in various stages of completion. A table full of tools 
has been set up in the center of this building for the shop owner 
to stand behind and a rough mat has been tossed in the corner for 
a bed.

Trugga's Furs~
   Various pelts of unfortunate animals hang skinned and roughly 
dressed from the walls of this shop and other projects and 
failures of the owner are piled up in the corners. Hats, gloves, 
vests and cloaks all made from whatever various animal furs the 
furrier could get his grubby hands on have been placed on sale in 
this dark, dank shop. A lantern hangs in one corner, casting a 
scant amount of light and summoning forth grotesquely oversized 
shadows of the shopkeeper and the customers visiting this place.

other denizens dwell within the cave, looking over the arrayed

Snargol's Carpentry~
   The air in this bulging stone cave is permeated with sawdust, 
making it quite difficult to breathe. Rusty wood-working tools 
and freshly made tables fill the place, while one corner is 
stacked with wooden planks. A large sarcophagus stacked with 
bedding lies in one corner, around which is scattered numerous 
tankards and glass bottles, shows that the carpenter also lives 
in this jumbled mess.

The Shop of an Yrch Tailor~

of linen, while the back of the shop is filled with bottles of 
dyes. The center of the room contains a work table where most of 
the tailor's works are created. Racks upon racks of roughly 
made, moth-eaten garments hold this store's merchandise. The 
shop is small, enclosed from the rest of the underground chamber 
with a wall of wooden planks that have been hammered together in 
a haphazard fashion.

Within the Great Market~
   The walls of the large, dilapidated building seem in a better 
repair here than further on to the northwest. A stone ceiling 
spans over most of the area, a staircase that lacks any railing 
providing access to the storey above. Stalls and stands huddle in 
clusters, a number of customers and shopkeepers alike milling 
through the area and causing a great deal of noise. 
   A wide hole gapes in the southern wall, providing a way out of 
the Market.

Inside a Very Cluttered Tent~
   All manner of materials goods lie strewn about this tent, 
piled on counters and overflowing from rickety crates. This tent 
functions as a pawn shop of sorts, and the majority of items 
passing through seem to be of human make. It seems as though 
anything and everything can be found here, if one has the 
inclination to search for it.

A Small Oddities Shop~
   Inside this small building of salvaged wood and straw 
thatching is what looks to be some kind of shop, stocking all 
kinds of wares from the marginally useful to the downright 
bizarre. Neat, tidy display shelves sit about the store, 
creating an illusion of order that is quickly dispelled by anyone 
that attempts to browse said shelves for wares - they appear 
totally devoid of any kind of logical arrangement, which makes 
for confusing shopping. What would once have been a completely 
boarded floor has been broken and even removed in places, 
creating a nasty maze of snags for the improperly shoed shopper.

Within a Stall On the Great Market~
   This is a rather spacious stall, leaning against the ruined 
building's wall, the rest of it constructed of wooden logs and 
planks. There is a long running counter, behind which sits many 
barrels and crates, containing multitudinous goods and wares, 
some of which are also displayed in wooden display cases about 
the stone floor. There is generally a fairly large flow of 
patronage through this area, ensuring that it is rarely a quiet 
place.

   This place is nothing but a part of an upper floor of the 
large building that once stood here. It is the only part 
remaining, a landing atop a staircase, the floor to north and 
west dropping off and allowing the view on the patchwork of 
makeshift roofs covering the Great Market below. To the 
southeast, two walls come to meet in a corner.

The Woundstitcher's Stall~
   A pungent mixture of smells of orkish salves and concoctions 
lingers heavily in the air, coupling with the scents of herbs 
that have been hung in brush-like clusters from the low ceiling. 
A small table stands to one side, lined with grotesque, wicked 
looking tools of dark iron, ranging from curved blades to 
sharpened hooks to cruelly-toothed saws. It would seem like an 
unpleasant experience to be forced into the hands of the 
physician dwelling here, but there is almost always at least one 
patient present, no matter the time of day or night.

A Circular Platform Overlooking the Fortress Below~
   Stepping out into this large flat area south of the cavern, 
the scale of the hall can be truly appreciated, as it pushes out 
from the ravine wall. A large iron grill offers a view below and 
indeed is the only flooring offered. A waist-high white stone 
wall circles the edge of the platform to ensure that those 
defending this place are secure. While the great edge of the 
Hall blocks all view eastwards and above, across the ravine the 
opposite tower stares back through multiple windows and archer 
platforms. Narrow stone bridges can be seen. It is slightly 
higher up the ravine than this one. Below, it becomes apparent 
that this is directly above the fortified entrance to the 
fortress. Larger holes in the grilles suggest that oil and rocks 
can be dropped from here.

An Archer Platform~
   Pressing out from the armory, a small section of rotting 
wooden bridge links to a precarious finger of stone that juts out 
westwards. Repaired sufficiently to bear the weight of those who 
would defend this place, the short crossing reaches a walled 
platform pointing away over the marketplace towards the opposite 
knuckled towers climbing the ravine. The buttresses are wide but 
only half a dozen archers could hope to stand together here. The 
high winds are somewhat subdued if crouching and firing through 
the carefully cut broad slits facing downwards and offering a 
view of the goings on far below.

A Cleared Section Of A Dreary Wood~
   Foliage has been crudely hacked and cleared from this portion 
of the sparsely wooded landscape to make room for a stone-ringed 
training circle. Large stones set at regular intervals around 
the area to mark off the boundaries of this relatively 
well-maintained area from the birch and beech-tree forest as well 
as the rest of the campsite. Unseen but not unfelt, the Spire 
beckons far to the south of here, through the Brown Lands and 
passed marshes and hillscapes.

Within a Circle of Gypsy Wagons and Hide Tents~
   This collection of tents and wagons seem to press against the 
end of the ravine, with many spilling out from the Lodge to come 
here. Hide tents of various styles and sizes as well as gaudily 
painted wagons and caravans creak and the sound of wind upon 
leather fills the air as all is buffeted by the ravine's winds. 
Some respite is granted by a large firepit which has been built 
in the centre of the circle, granting some degree of warmth and 
light as well as acting as a gathering point around which an 
eclectic collection of dark skinned individuals seem to 
congregate. The place has a lively air and the area is often 
filled with the sounds of music and laughter despite the 
harshness of the surroundings.

Within a Smoke Filled Tent~
   This semi permanent tent has a wooden frame covered in thick 
brightly dyed felt in a myriad of colours and designs. A fire 
burns continually in the centre of the tent, upon which a variety 
of herbs seem to be regularly thrown, sending a heady plume of 
smoke rising up through a circular hole at the apex of the roof, 
this is somewhat ineffective however, and the entire tent is hazy 
with smoke. Hide mats of various sorts are lain thickly upon the 
ground, and scattered about are various strange plants and 
artifacts - skulls, bones and nameless things that float in jars. 
Strange signs and symbols have been painted upon the walls of the 
tent in the blood of some hapless animal and talismans of feet, 
paws, feathers and other, darker things hang from the ceiling at 
various points.

An Enclosed Underground Room~
   The cramped feeling of this small room is enhanced even 
further by the low ceiling and darkness of the surrounding rock. 
A number of stone shelves have been cut directly into the stone 
walls, providing room enough to store a decent amount of goods, 
but it would be very uncomfortably for more than one person to 
browse through the items stored here due to the narrow confines. 
A small door of plates of iron is the only exit and there is not 
even a hint of a natural light reaching this deep into the 
underground.

   The ground slopes downwards towards the centre of the 
bowl-shaped floor of this roughly oval chamber. It is worn 
smooth by the feet of many, several steps carved into the rock 
where the ground slopes too sharply. The high ceiling seems to 
copy the shape of the ground below, bulging downwards above the 
lowest portion of the cavern, where a stone pillar rises to meet 
it. The pillar itself seems to be of the nature's own make, a 
smooth stone trunk sturdy enough to support the tons of ground 
pressing onto it. 
   Layers of rotten furs cover the floor, emitting fetid odor. 
Half-eaten, broken bones are littered among them.

A Crudely Hewn Chamber~
   A narrow opening to the north widens into a moderately-sized 
space that was created by excavating the dark, veined rock 
surrounding this place. The walls are bearing numerous marks of 
digging instruments, the ceiling hangs no higher than six or 
seven feet, dropping down sharply in random places to prepare 
nasty traps where an unwary person taller than than a Mountain 
Orc might hit their heads painfully. 
   There are piles of random organic refuse lining the walls, 
from bones to rotten meat to pieces of raw hides and rags. Some 
of the stinky trash has been used to create a number of nest-like 
beddings.

   Stretching a short distance from east to west, this dark 
passage has been hewn out of the earth's innards in a crude, 
hasty fashion. Rough, chipped walls and uneven floor evidence 
this as much as the low, pick-scarred ceiling that seems to reach 
higher towards the east, from where a loud chatter of orcs comes 
along with the warmth and light of a burning fire. Westwards, 
the corridor ends with a solid door, studded with crude iron 
nails whose pointed, rusting ends poke outwards from the wood 
dangerously.

A Narrow Trail Through The Woods~
   This thin trail, more than anything a trampled footpath 
leading over the dried leaves lining the ground for those leaving 
the camp at the trail's northern end, is surrounded by the same 
scrubby forest as the camp to the north, only scant vegetation 
interspersed between the beeches and birches. A small, 
fast-flowing streams flows past, curving from east to north, and 
providing one of the few sources of water in the region, drawing 
wildlife to it. Southward, where lies the new fortress, the land 
rises up towards the edge of the basin, beyond which lies the 
swampland separating the camp from destination.

Thinning forest Nearing The Edge Of The Basin~
   The forest here spreads out, the trees thinning the further 
they get from the stream to the north. The trail leading from 
the camp cuts off, the forest not dense enough to require people 
to take the same paths through. Numerous dead trees are 
interspersed with the live, bark and leaves littering the ground, 
and, climbing the crest to the south, one can overlook the 
basin's edge, seeing the desolate wastelands of the Brown Lands, 
beyond which lie the fortress to which the Vanguard journeys. 
Between two slight ridges in the ground lies a long rut, and, 
across it has been felled one of the larger trees, warriors 
occasionally seen tussling upon it as they play at Gherdop.

   Beads of condesned moisture glisten on the walls of this

occasional droplet breaking their surface from time to time when 
it falls from the ceiling. The tunnel curves slowly, deviating 
first a little northwards and then back south, making it 
impossible to see from one end to another. 
   Eastwards, the passage ends with a door made of a stone slab.

A Spacious, Damp Cavern~
   The ceiling of this elongated chamber rises high above, 
several long stalactites reaching downwards from it like stone 
spears. The air is damp here, several pools of water dotting the 
uneven ground here and there, fed by the water dripping off the 
stalactites' ends at irregular intervals. Between the small 
pools is a scattering of items, from animal remains rendered 
useless by age and gnawing teeth of orcs to bits of items so 
damaged they are no longer useful. 
   The southern portion of this natural cavern has been walled 
off with use of large stone blocks mortared with clay and mud. A 
wooden door has been set into the wall. To the east, there is a 
ledge visible about ten feet above the floor, two sets of crude 
stone stairs leading up to it from both its northern and southern 
side.

Several bins occupy the sparse space provided by the uneven room.

Upon a Small Plateau Housing Orkish Nests~
   Overlooking the spacious cavern below, this plateau stretches 
from its jagged edge for several feet before it ends with a rock 
wall to the east. This entire space has been used to provide 
room for a number of crude nests of rags and furs, serving as a 
bedding for the orcs living within these caves. 
   A set of crude steps has been carved both on the northern and 
the southern side of the plateau, providing uncomfortable way 
down from here.

A Narrow Corridor Deep Underground~
   Hacked out of the earth's grasp with many strikes of picks and 
other tools, this tunnel is only wide enough for one stout person 
to pass through comfortably at once. However, the ceiling is 
relatively high, allowing for even the tallest of yrch to move 
without the need to bend uncomfortably. The walls are covered 
with some kind of lichen that emits soft, eerie light, but in 
many places it is scratched and scraped off, and its 
phosphorescence is far from being strong enough to allow much 
visibility for anyone not used to living in darkness.

A Spacious Armory~
   This wide, elongated room is filled with racks and crates to 
hold a number of items, the weaponry and armor of the Witchking's 
trusted orkish soldiers. Several pathways have been kept clear 
among all the cointainers, providing easy access to anything 
needed. There are several lanterns hanging from the ceiling, 
casting a sparse amount of a flickering light onto the 
surroundings and drawing wavering, misshapen shadows onto the 
walls.

Steps Below A Staring Tower Maw~
   Southwards, rough stairs plunge steeply to wind down the side 
of the ravine's cliff-face. Here, a basin of rock has been 
smoothed and widened so that a company could stand here together. 
While the jagged black rock of the Mountains of Shadow press in 
to the west and east, a great white stone arch blocks the way 
northwards. Half-finished sculpted figures stand in isolated, 
heroic relief, above the archway along a protruding shelf, though 
no true details adorn them. The arch itself clearly denotes the 
entrance to a finger-like tower stretching up above, two more 
natural bulges in the mountains set to the east of this one, 
resembling great knuckles. As the mountains press in overhead, 
roughly hewn, unfinished stonework above the arch and shelf jut 
out like the teeth of a great maw to gape at any who have made 
the perilous journey up to it. Archers can be seen peering from 
its jutting jaw most times.

A Rising Chamber Under the Mountains~
   Walls of light-colored, veined stone shoot upwards around this 
circular chamber's perimeter, supported by pillars that curve as 
they turn into massive ribs bearing the weight of the ceiling. 
Parts of these ribs are missing, though, torn out by the ravages 
of time and are most likely now contributing to the mounds of 
rubble piled out of the way by the walls. It takes a good 
observer to realize the entire chamber was built partly by 
carving out the rock of the mountain itself, partly by adding 
extra stonework; the two blend in an organic manner and despite 
the age and time, it is hard to make out which parts are composed 
of the additional masonry. 
   There are no windows, only a huge arch of white stone housing 
a gate to the south. In the middle of the room, there is a 
spiraling stone staircase leading up and into the higher parts of 
this building. A small shutter has been placed inside the gate 
that can be slid to one side.

A Chamber Overlooking the Tower Entrance~
   A staircase of spiraling stone steps pierces through this 
moderately-sized room as it connects a chamber below with the 
upper reaches of the tower above. The walls and floor here are 
made of a gray stone, its pebbly, grainy texture emphasized by 
age. 
   There is a narrow stone door in the southeastern corner of the 
room, facing south. It would seem there may have been a mirror 
doorway to the southwest, but the part of the wall in that area 
has been rebuilt with a plain masonry different from the rest of 
the building. A wider doorway allows passage northwards, its 
arch outlining the shape of twin tree-trunks, but it seems the 
sculpture has never been finished.

An Expansive Chamber In The Tower~
   Six pillars leading away from the southern doorway in twin 
rows support the ribbed ceiling of this spacious, elongated 
chamber. All but one pillar are perfectly smooth, the one 
remaining bearing rough outlines of some spiralling, floral 
decorative carving, so worn down with time that it is no longer 
recognizable. 
   Up above to the both west and east, narrow openings too small 
even for a child to squeeze through have been set into the walls, 
wind whistling through them with soft moans.

Low-Ceilinged Chamber~
   A round chamber spreads away from the spiraling staircase 
stationed in its centre, the floor smooth and tiled with a number 
of large tiles, most of them chipped and cracked, the narrow 
crevices and wider gaps between them filled with dust. The 
barrel-shaped ceiling arches slightly, sloping down towards the 
walls to the east and west so low that even an orc would be 
barely able to stand comfortably in these parts of the room.

Exposed Platform Above the Jagged Maw~
   While open to the elements, on a clear day it is easy to look 
across to the opposite, if slightly lower, tower, with its narrow 
rising entrance bulging eventually into a cavernous overhang. 
Figures can be seen on the many butresses above the dwellings and 
market within which the blackbloods and humans mingle. Winds 
whip up into a fury and brush away the rising smoke to the 
southwest rising from the chimneys of the foundries. An 
unfinished rock jagged rock wall lines this platform and gives 
the impression to those standing below of teeth.

   A wide hall spreads from south to north, a sizeable weapon

identifying it as a storage area. A number of narrow alcoves 
line the walls, a trio of wooden shelves set into each to provide 
further room to keep goods in. A couple of lantern hang above 
each of the tables, ready to cast light onto the room that would 
otherwise drown in darkness due to the lack of any windows. A 
scent of dust lingers heavy in the air.

Expansive Chamber~
   An elongated chamber stretches from south to north, enclosed 
by walls of large stone blocks. A vaulted ceiling spans 
overhead, its height giving the room a spacious feeling. Several 
narrow apertures high in the walls provide a scant amount of 
light during daytime, and a few plain iron sconces bearing 
torches are used to supplement it when it is dark outside. There 
are furs hanging from the walls, doing little to block off the 
uncomfortable chill emitting from the hard stones. A line of 
beds sits to either side of the room, turning it into a barracks 
of sorts. 
   A low, wide pedestal has been set at the northern end of the 
chamber, bearing a sculpture. It seems it used to depict some 
feminine figure wearing a flowing skirt or a dress, the dark rock 
worked carefully to follow every fold of the fabric, retaining 
the detail despite the tooth of time. However, the statue has 
been broken off at the waist, and the rest is nowhere in sight.

A Decrepit Barracks~
   What was once a narrow crevice in the rock has been expanded 
into a wide room by skilled hands. Every surface, other than the 
ceiling, has been squared and leveled. While chisel marks are 
still visible, some effort has been made to smooth them down, 
though the work was never completed. A single rusted 
torch-holder has been fitted into the stone and is now kept 
filled. Scattered throughout the area are a few iron frame 
bunks, their fittings barely preserved over the hundreds of years 
they may have rested here. Along the eastern wall has been 
carved into the stone a tall and slender tree, its limbs nearly 
touching the ceiling of the chamber, and its roots almost 
reaching the floor. Seven five-pointed stars have been artfully 
entwined within the branches.

Top of the Tower~
   Circular in shape and enclosed by sturdy but aged walls, this 
chamber's upper parts reach high above where a set of 
crisscrossing wooden beams and bressumers supports the roof of 
the tower. The roof is clearly of newer make, the plainly worked 
wood bearing no signs of rot or decay, not even darkened by age 
yet. Air can be heard hissing and moaning as it races past the 
tower's top, causing the apex to rattle and shake occasionaly 
with some of the stronger gusts. 
   Twin doorways lead away from here: a narrow, iron-banded door 
to the east and a simpler door set into a graceful but 
dilapidated arch to the north.

A Tunnel Curving Through the Tower~
   This natural tunnel makes its way from the stairwell for a 
short distance before turning towards the south. Stone walls 
have had little work done to them, only when it narrows have 
masons come and chiseled away enough stone to make passage easy. 
About midway through this section a single door has been neatly 
carved into the stone of the northern wall, allowing passage into 
a chamber beyond. To the south the tunnel continues on its way.

A Tunnel Leading to Walls~
   In contrast to the section north of here, this tunnel has been 
expanded in such a way as to make it both wider and taller. 
Rough chisel marks are still present, and the occasional broken 
tool has been discarded along the floor. Along the western wall 
of this tunnel, the basic outline of a tree can be seen, though 
no details have been added to it. Opposite the tree is set a 
heavy iron door, a sword having been engraved onto its surface to 
signify what might be beyond it. To the south another iron door 
is set, rust already staining its surface. If one were to touch 
it, they would find it cool to the touch.

   Rows upon rows of rotted wooden weapons racks have been placed 
in this area, some of them in better shape than others. The door 
is wide enough that they could, in times of need, have been 
pushed out into the hallway to give men on their way to the walls 
weapons. This chamber is high and wide, still mostly in its 
natural state, though the floor has been smoothed and any 
protrusions removed from the ceiling.

   This chamber has obviously been carved into the solid rock of 
the mountain by skilled hands, all surfaces squared and even, 
despite the chisel marks present on them. The walls here are 
bare of any decoration, though iron rungs have been set high near 
the ceiling where tapestries might have once been hung. 
Throughout the room however is training equipment: pell-blocks, 
balance-beams, climbing-ropes and walls, an circle where in the 
floor a line has been carved to cordon it off for sparring 
practice. Obviously never used, much of the equipment is in fine 
condition, though a bit of rot touches some of the wood. It has 
clearly been placed here recently.

The Top of a Spiral Staircase~
   If one had climbed all the way from the very bottom of this 
staircase, it is likely by now they would be exhausted from the 
effort. Here, no natural cave has aided the masons, as the 
chisel marks in the unbroken and solid stone indicate. As it 
nears the very top portion, a larger slit than in most other 
sections of the tower has been carved, looking towers the ravine 
below to the west. No steps now rise above the head of any 
climbing the stairs, providing them finally with a bit of 
head-room during the last spiral. At the top, a straight passage 
moving east into the tower greets any who have business at its 
highest portion.

A Straight Tunnel in the Tower~
   Carved from the solid rock, this passage is for the most part 
unremarkable. The neatness of the chisel marks along the walls 
indicate that while this was perhaps one of the last areas of the 
tower completed, it had the greatest of care put into it. 
Perhaps wide enough for two men to walk abreast, it continues 
into the tower a short way before stopping at two doors. The one 
to the east is formed from solid iron, on its surface has been 
engraved a delicate tree, seven stars resting in its branches. 
To the south is a half-rotted oaken door, obviously having not 
spent the years well maintained.

A Cramped Study~
   This small chamber carved from the rock of the mountain is 
slightly cramped, capable of holding perhaps five or six men at a 
time. Despite this, care has obviously been taken in its 
creation. Each wall, the floor, and the ceiling, has been 
carefully evened and smoothed. Obviously put to use while the 
rest of the ravine was being built, a solid oak desk has been 
placed in the center of it. Papers that have crumbled to dust 
are scattered around the place, making moving through the area a 
dust-raising affair. On the western wall has been expertly 
carved a relief map of the ravine, its various tiers and towers 
laid out clearly. On the eastern wall sits a small doorway, the 
door itself laying nearby on the floor, having rotted out of its 
hinges.

   A solid arch of light-colored stone spans between two slim 
towers, the stonework worn down by the whipping winds and lashing 
rain it has been exposed to during its long lifetime. Down 
below, the view of the ravine holding the building of the Market 
can be seen. Another, stout tower sits across the ravine to the 
southwest, 
   The slender building rising at the eastern side of the arch is 
higher than the other one, battlements that circle around its 
crown-like top overseeing the bridge.

A Chilly Chamber With a Ribbed Ceiling~
   A large sandstone pillar takes up the center of this room, 
worked into a likeness of a tree, its four branches curving 
outwards to create arching ribs supporting the roofing. More 
such branches sprout out from four points around the room's 
perimeter, their tips meeting in the uppermost parts of the four 
major vaults that form the ceiling. However, the sandstone 
didn't quite hold against erosion and time, and some of the ribs 
have parts missing, the detail of the sculpting worn away and 
left only in hints and stubs. 
   A narrow staircase rises along the western wall, one landing 
holding a door which provides passage out of the room and the 
tower, and another smaller doorway set even higher up along the 
wall, just below the ceiling. Another staircase is to the east, 
this one descending through the floor to the lower parts of the 
tower.

Chilly Outdoor Ledge~
   A stone ring encircles the outside of the tower, creating a 
shelf just wide enough for one person to walk across at a time. 
Below, there is a sheer drop along the tower's length, ending 
somewhere below among the hard, pointed rocks. Some parts of the 
narrow ledge have crumbled apart, some pieces of stone have been 
worked loose by erosion loose, making the crossing precarious at 
best. It is very cold here, the crisp wind chilling to the 
bones. 
   A small doorway sits in the tower's wall, allowing passage in.

   A narrow stone walkway that encircles the tower's top widens 
here, protected by buttressed wall which juts out a little away 
from the main building. The entire structure serves as an archer 
platform which oversees the area between this tower and the lower 
one that stands to the west, most importantly the interconnecting 
bridge spanning in between. Aged merlons have fallen apart, 
leaving the crenellations in a dilapidated, forlorn state and 
somewhat detracting from the wall's defensive value.

   Even the presence of a small fireplace doesn't quite chase 
away the penetrating chill of the surrounding stone walls. There 
are rugs scattered on the floor, but otherwise the room appears 
plain and unadorned, a rotund chamber spreading away from a 
landing of a staircase hugging the eastern wall. The air is very 
still here, bits of dust visible in the air and ready to invade 
the nostrils of anyone coming here to eat or argue. Despite all 
that, this appears to be a meeting place of sorts, and often 
there are at least a couple of yrchin present.

A Kitchen With a Fire-Marked Ceiling~
   Layers of greasy, black soot cling to the ceiling of this 
chamber, thickest and darkest above the wall opposite to the 
doorway where a fireplace and an oven stand. The air is filled 
with a mixture of scents of prepared food, spices and fire, all 
the typical scents associated with a kitchen like this one. The 
sides of the room are taken up with racks carrying various 
ingredients and tools, be it herbs, jars of uncertain content, 
sizeable pots or just simple spoons and knives. 
   It is warmer here than in the rest of the tower, the small 
space keeping some of the heat coming from the fire.

A Grand Chamber Facing a Rondel Window~
   Time did little to detract from the grandeur of this high 
chamber, its stonework remaining mostly smooth, withstanding the 
age with its superb craftsmanship. Four tall pillars shoot 
upwards towards the ceiling, supporting a web-like pattern of the 
vaults above. The western wall bears a carved depiction of a 
tree, standing tall and proud, crowned with seven stars and 
flanked by a pair of oversized figures whose features are no 
longer readable. Rainbow-like patterns have been conjured by the 
sunlight coming from outside through a majestic rondel window 
high above on the southern wall, a mosaic of stained glass that 
depicts a battle scene of the Men of the West pushing against a 
faltering line of bronze-clad men. Yet, some of the panes are 
cracked, some missing altogether, air whistling through the 
remaining gaps.

outside, it is nothing but a circle of black glass, but the 
webbing of metal between panes of stained glass can be perceived 
even now. Obviously, some kind of a mosaic has been set into it, 
and it would become visible once the sun rises again.

Square Chamber~
   Two slit-like windows, too narrow for anything bigger than the 
smallest of orcs to squeeze through, have been set into the walls 
to the east and west. Jagged bits of glass frame the apertures, 
pitiful remains of what once must have been panels keeping the 
chilly draft outside. Nowadays, there is a dried piece of animal 
hide worked thin and stretched across the windows, barely 
ranslucent but serviceable. The rest of the room seems just as 
bare and forlorn, the walls and floor smooth, the ceiling plain 
and lacking any ornamentation.

A Semicircular Chamber~
   A row of life-sized statues has been stood along the curve of 
the semicircular wall enclosing this apse-like room from all 
sides but north. Regal and proud, these must have been kings of 
ages long past, the sculptures still keeping their majesty in 
spite of the time that managed to erase most of the detail from 
their features. Each of the figures carries a different item, 
adopting a slightly different poise: one standing with its hands 
laid atop the hilt of a stone greatsword planted against the 
ground, another holding a book or bearing a long shield with some 
faded symbol across its surface. All of the statues stare ahead, 
directly at the center of the room. 
   The ceiling isn't too high here and is in much worse state of 
disrepair than the rest of the room, chunks of it missing, cracks 
running across its width. In some places, stars can be seen, the 
last remnants of some carving that used to decorate the domed 
vault above the room.

The Tower's Basement~
   A wide flat area spreads here, hewn out of the surrounding 
dark, near-black rock with care and patience. The walls are 
smooth, but irregularly shaped, rippling and curving in hypnotic 
designs that make it appear a smooth-walled natural cave. Only 
to the east there is a wall built, large blocks of the same dark 
stone separating this chamber from the world outside, a small 
doorway set into a plain, unadorned arch. Dampness and moisture 
has begun to claim parts of the room, condensed water glistening 
on the walls, a few small puddles on the floor fed by the water 
dripping from a barely perceivable crack in the southern wall and 
ceiling. 
   Several torches have been set into sconces surrounding the 
room, their flickering glow making the wet walls glint and 
sparkle.

Low Unfinished Chamber~
   Hewn from the mountain's unyielding grasp with use of tools, 
patience and raw strength, it seems this chamber has never been 
finished beyond the rough excavation of its outlines. The walls 
and floor still bear marks of pick and chisel, chipped roughly 
into shape and then left alone for centuries. It is dusty here, 
small bits of rocks and rubble littering the ground, darkness and 
chill permeating the area.

A Spacious Cell~
   Several pillars running down the length of this elongated 
chamber support the low, barrel-vaulted ceiling of this room. At 
a first glance, it might seem like a spacious, underground 
cellar, but the straw scattered across the ground, the few crude, 
uncomfortable beddings of simple rags and the thick door bearing 
no lock or knob from the inside, all of that hint at the real use 
of this room: a place to hold several prisoners at once. It is 
very dark here, the only light coming in through the barred 
window set in the door being a flickering glow of the torches 
outside. Cockroaches and small rodents call this place their 
territory, a flicker of movement visible here and there as they 
race across the floor in search for a morsel of food.

Ancient Stone Steps Carved Out of the Ravine~
   Cut behind an outjutting pillar of rock clinging onto the vast 
shoulders of the northernmost flanks of the black rock of the 
Mountains of Shadow, huge steps have been cut into the bare rock. 
As wide as a carriage and tall enough to tire even the most 
practised climber, they wind up and up above, always keeping 
behind the crag and out of sight of the inhabitants below. Moss 
and damp lichen cling to the steps, making progress dangerous and 
precarious. When the rain falls here it channels down in large 
gullies of streaming, drenching and freezing water.

A Bailey Surrounded by Wooden Walls~
   This area is a bailey enclosed with wooden walls with ramparts 
running along every wall capable of supporting many warriors. 
The walls block of every direction forming a square with the 
southern and northern walls leading into the old palisade far 
towards the east. To the west resides a massive fire-hardened 
reinforced wooden gate standing between the western wall with its 
frame assisting in the support of a shaded platform. Its four 
massive fire hardened pillars are aligned and separated equally 
apart from one another allowing those passing a wide birth while 
a set of stairs has been placed along the northern side of the 
platform allowing archers to make the climb up.

An Artificial Expansion of a Cavern~
   A section of a natural cavern to the west has been expanded to 
house this unevenly-shaped chamber. The walls are jagged and 
craggy, dug out with haste and little attention to how the result 
would look, and it seems the ceiling is barely sturdy enough not 
to cave in. A number of Warband members mill around at all 
times, all of the armed heavily and ready to march.

A Damp, Caved-In Hallway Lined With Sarcophagi ~
   This hallway looks to originally have been much longer, though 
much of its western end seems to have collapsed in some mud slide 
long ago. Originally rather a grand affair, it is now a damp and 
gloomy shadow of its previous glory and is continually filled 
with the musty stench of decay. The floor and walls are 
plastered with mud and beetles and spiders make their homes in 
the shadowy alcoves of this dilapidated mausoleum. Set into 
recesses along both walls at regular intervals are large stone 
Sarcophagi, many of them smashed and broken, though one or two 
remain intact. Sculpted into the forms of armour clad knights 
and their ladies fair, they stare starkly into eternity. At the 
eastern end of the hallway stands a massive stone door, heavy 
enough so as to be absolutely impenetrable it is inlaid in fine 
silver with the form of the White Tree of Gondor crowned by the 
seven stars of the House of Elendil.

A Musty-Smelling, Ruined Burial Chamber~
   This large, hexagonal room would once have been a splendid 
place, though many years of disuse and neglect have caused it to 
fall into disrepair. A perpetual musty smell hangs in the air 
here while careful inspection of the walls would show that they 
are covered by many cracks and are damp to the touch, mould and 
fungus seeming to take hold in many of the dark recesses of this 
place. The floor of the chamber is of smooth, black marble, a 
mosaic in the centre showing a beautiful depiction of the White 
Tree of Gondor, in tiles of that colour. Rusting iron sconces 
jut out from the walls here between various freizes of Gondorian 
military triumph, orc and easterling alike fleeing before the 
mail-clad soldiers of the west. To the east of the room, a pair 
of large braziers frame a small flight of stairs that rise up to 
a raised platform there -- cracked with age, they still appears 
usable.

A Raised Platform Bedecked in Fading Opulence~
   Rising up from the main chamber, the back wall of this 
platform bear what must once have been a beautiful mural of 
Osgiliath at it's height, though it has been worn away with age 
and damp, much of what it once portrayed may still be discerned. 
The dome of the stars rises from amidst a sea of white buildings 
bisected by the crystalline blue of the river Anduin while 
stretching away to the east lies the endless green of Ithilien, 
the mountains of shadow nothing more than a black smudge on the 
horizon. In front of this lies a large coffin made of glass, 
curtained by heavy drapery, now rotting and faded, though once it 
was rich and vibrant. The floor of the platform is made of 
smooth marble, inlaid with delicate silver knotwork about its 
semi-circular border, where a wooden handrail has been placed. A 
small flight of stairs descend into the rest of the burial 
chamber.

back into the very fabric of the mountain itself. It seems to 
have long since given in to the immense weight bearing down upon 
it and is filled with all manner of rubble and debris. The air 
is thick with dust and the pervading scent of damp and decay. 
The masonry that remains is of high quality and fragments of the 
remaining carvings and embellishments would indicate this was a 
place of some importance in ages past.

A Large, Ruined Atrium Filled With Overgrown Flora~
   Though faded now, the grandeur of this Atrium would have been 
spectacular in it's day. Rising high above, the metal framework 
of a large dome rusts away, shards of broken glass and scraps of 
twisted metal can be spotted amongst the greenery here where 
sections of it have collapsed and the weather freely enters in 
from above. Where once would have been tidy, manicured plants, 
years of neglect have caused the area to run rampant, oversized 
bushes and plants have overrun most of the area, while flowering 
vines and ivy have covered much of the walls. Such is the 
disrepair of this place that it is difficult to discern the path 
that meanders through this jungle-in-miniature, though the 
observant would note it leads to several corridors that branch 
off this lofty chamber as well as descending into a dipped area 
at the centre. A set of stone steps, overrun with moss and 
incredibly slippery looking, rise to join a rusting metal 
mezzanine that runs in a circular pathway above.

A Cavernous, Unfinished Chamber~
   Left unfinished by the original architects of this place, the 
walls of this ancient chamber still bear the scars from where it 
was hacked from the bare rock. Carved into the fabric of the 
mountain itself this entire chamber is filled with a damp, musty 
smell and gives the impression of being little more than a cave 
with a door. In modern times, attempts have been made to 
disguise the unabashed primitiveness of the place, the walls hung 
with cheap, yet colourful fabrics while candles attempt to drive 
away the gloom that clings to every corner and crevice of the 
place. A fireplace has been built into one wall, though it makes 
little impact upon the oppressive coldness and damp of the bare 
rock walls, it vents poorly and causes the room to be constantly 
filled with a hazy film of smoke. To one side of the room, a 
screen has been raised, separating the area into two sections.

Clearly intended as a sleeping and dressing area, the walls and 
floors of this place are draped in fabrics and soft furnishings 
in an array of gaudy hues, while candles are set upon every 
available surface, feebly attempting to introduce light and 
colour to this irredeemably dreary place. Regular burning of 
incense, as well as the flowers that are constantly strewn across 
the floor here do an inadequate job of disguising the musty smell 
of this area, which is a constantly detectable undertone while 
the mildew that clings to a few of the curtains attests to the 
perpetual damp of this glorified cave.

   This small wooden stall is hastily constructed of a wooden 
frame, with tanned and cured hides stretched across it and held 
in place with leather thongs. Most of the hides are perfectly 
commonplace, deer and boar, though several of a more exotic 
nature can also be seen. The construction of this stall does an 
acceptable job of keeping off the worst of the weather though 
small puddles of water do occasionally collect on the floor when 
it rains. The wind shrieks mercilessly through even the tiniest 
gaps in the hide covering of this structure, while the cracking 
of the leather as it is constantly buffeted by near gale-force 
winds is almost deafening.

   Bathed in an uneven glow by two bulbous glass lanterns this 
small room has a austere appearance bearing little in the way of 
adornments. Filled instead with many crates, barrels and boxes 
all stacked in an neat and orderly fashion whilst large cabinets 
are set towards the back and broad shelves hang from the walls. 
A large leather bound tome of midnight black sits on a small 
pedestal keeping due account of goods coming in and good going 
out. It makes for a cozy if small storage area.

Within a Canyon Below Two Towers~
   Encompassing the narrow section of the canyon, this small path 
snakes its way along the stony, hard ground. A few crumbling 
bones, with shreds of small pieces of old clothing litter the 
landscape. Gently ascending levels of black rock comprise the 
rough walls of the canyon. To the south an unfinished tower juts 
out, seemingly deserted. Looming far overhead to the north the 
Spire Keep can be seen, along with a small overhang that slightly 
branches outward. Just below the Spire is a smaller, completed 
structure, the claimed home of the Uruk-hai elite. Two rocky, 
black walls rise up to both the east and west with the occasional 
raven's nest situated upon small ledges. Having very sparse 
vegetation, the wind whisks the loose sand through the air as 
well as a foul, drifting stench. 
   A small, twisting path of stone leads up the northern wall 
midway, seemingly blocked by a solid section of rock.

Within an Old Foyer at the Base of a Keep~
   Once a foyer of adorn with majestic tapesteries and light the
passage of time has worked its cruel hand at making it a place
of decay and darkness.  Littered across the smooth stone floor
is the remnants of masterfully crafted braziers that has fallen,
or been torn from their carefully worked places within the walls.
   Crudely repaired wooden steps spiral up the gently tapering
tower, a few discernable sigils etched along the way within the
walling.  A fireplace is disrepair is set within the eastern
wall, stuffed with debris and plaster that has fallen from around
its opening.
   The sounds of the nearby foundry ring out unceasingly here
as the noise echos within the tower.  Steps lead out of the foyer
towards the gates, passing underneath an arch covered in cobwebs.

At the Midway Point of the Keep~
    A precariously hanging painting is adjacent of the stairs of
a bearded man with a crown upon his head with a few small tears
at the corner of it.  A small spider can be seen crawling around
upon its web, quickly advancing towards its captured meal that is
situated overhead upon an aged beam of oak.
   A few cracks run the length of the structure in places, having
only recently been repaired.  An awful stench is in the air here
that has made its way from the tannery which is not far off from
the location.  
   Various points of access to places where archers can take up
position to fire at anyone approaching are set along the tower's
walls which overlook the nearby surroudings.  One may travel
down or up the stairs from here, and at the top of the keep above
there a doorway can be seen leading out towards the west.

High Above the Ground Upon the Keep~
   An old, wooden barricade is set against the walls here where
the stairway ends which can be pushed and barred from this side
to prevent any would be attackers from easily gaining access to
the top of the keep.  A ledge runs around the room in a circular
pattern protected by stone walling that is shoulder height, having
multiple slits within it from which an archer can have aim all
along the stairs below.
   Upon a raised dias of stone there is a place to stack wood
that in ages past would be lit to alert of approaching enemies.
Several old, threadbare banners are broken at their base having
been carelessly thrown to the floor.  
   An arch of stone leads out towards the west with a now useless
wooden door that has a marred etching of a white tree hangs 
loosely upon its hinges.  Puddles of filthy, stagnate water is
gatered all along the floors slowly dripping down to below.

An Archer's Platform Upon the Keep~
   A stone platform extends slightly from the keep's main 
structure which provides an execellent vantage point from which
archers can launch volleys at the surroundings.  A soot-covered
wall of stone with gentle rising arches provides good protection
from incoming enemy fire.  
   Two larger sections within the wall allows one to manuever
rocks or boiling cauldrons of oil to the edge bring down upon 
the heads of any attackers.  Several long ago rusted bundles
of arrows have been tossed to the side, replaced with quivers
filled with black, crude arrows.  Spaced along the inner
walling are many small storage areas that were once used to
house bows are filled with muck and rainwater.
   A foggy haze hangs in the air as the continuious black smoke
which rises from various places within the Spire is carried by
upon the wind.

An Archer's Nest Overlooking the Surroundings~
   A sturdy platform overlooks an enclosed area between the twin 
gates below, a true killing field should anyone get trapped in 
this place. There is a simple roofing above the walkways to 
shelter the defenders from the rain, or perhaps sun as well, and 
clear view is offered of the trail leading towards the gates from 
the west, the fields along the palisade that stretches north of 
here, and the enclosure below.

Palisade Walkway Overlooking Terraced Fields~
   Putrid stench emanates from the Pits as they spread away below 
and to the east, muddy, dirty, and filled with its miserable, 
slavish occupants. Yet, someone has taken the care to defend 
this place, and the walkway you find yourself upon, even though 
narrow, seems sturdy enough to bear a few archers. To the west, 
the sight of the terraced fields just outside opens, as well as 
the greenery of Ithilien beyond and below.

steep side of a rocky outcrop to the north. Westwards, a clear 
view of the terraced farmland below the simple and crude 
fortifications opens, a good line of sight for any archer manning 
this walkway. On the opposite side, to the east, the sprawl of 
the Pits fills the valley as it continues to weave its way deeper 
into the Mountains of Shadow.

A Rubble-Littered Underground Tunnel~
   Narrow to the point of being uncomfortable, this tunnel is 
nothing more than a wider crack running through the rock wall, 
with the ground heaped and littered with stone rubble and debris. 
A stale, damp scent of moisture and worse hangs in the air, the 
craggy walls glistening with a dark wetness. It would seem that 
destruction has passed through here, the door set in the northern 
face almost shattered, wood splinters and shards spread on the 
ground in front of it. 
   In order to travel the crack, the need to excavate a goodly 
portion of the stone debris and rubble is obviously necessary.

A Debris-Cluttered Cavern Surrounding A Rubble-Filled Pool~
   This underground chamber reaches high and wide, opening into 
truly grand, cathedral-like proportions, where it would seem that 
destruction reigned down from at some point. Huge stone slabs, 
jagged boulders, and large chunks of rock are intermingled with 
stone debris and dust to a staggering proportion on the cavern 
floor. Moisture glistens on the walls, where odd-looking gashes 
scathe the stone, and a perpetual drip-drip sound coming from 
multiple places breaks the calm silence of this place. The floor 
is uneven, rising and dipping frequently in smooth curves, the 
wavy feeling accented by the marble-like texture of the rock, and 
completely covered with a thick carpet of rocky debris and 
rockfall. Throbbing, black vein-like roots have begun to spread 
out over all the rubble and ruin, barely standing out against the 
dark shadow of this place, and throbbing more when touched by 
light. 
   A great deal of excavation would be required to travel through 
this cavern. Whole slabs of stone have fallen to the floor, 
packed in with smaller rock, dust and dirt to almost block off 
the narrow crack to the south, and to completely fill in the 
passage to the west.

A Small, Roughly-Hewn Cavern~
   Deep underground, far away from the light of the sun, the 
hands of some industrious workers have shaped this small chamber 
of a roughly circular shape, which has escaped the severe damage 
experienced in the other chambers for the most part. Rubble and 
debris still litters the ground however, and the throbbing, black 
vein-like roots have grown thicker and wilder in this chamber. 
Scratchs mar the wet-glistened walls, some looking almost to 
depict crude sigils and runes, made darker than the rest of the 
wall from the stains of some dark liquid. 
   The eastern passage seems to have once been doored in, yet 
that wooden panel is smashed into bits, and filled in by stone 
rubble from the main cavern. Almost hidden from view, a small 
tunnel seems to have been scratched out from the wall, 
waist-height of the average orc, leading west through a shallow 
puddle of ichorous black murk.

Parapet Above The Gate~
   Stretching across the narrow canyon, the battlements rise 
proudly above the gate below and the buildings to the west. On 
either side, towers built into the cliff face of dark rock stare 
down. High above to the northeast, the Spire Keep stands out 
blackly, a stub of rock standing open for the Leapers. Westwards 
a rising trail to a dark mawed overhang and gate can be seen 
clearly by archers. 
   Broad steps lead down to the gate at the north end.

Battlements Stretching Across A Canyon~
   The wall here is broad and carefully constructed with huge 
dark stone blocks set perfectly together. High merlons offer 
shelter from archers, with the open embrasures between them 
carved to exceptional quality, silvered tree branches clearly 
visible throughout. The eastern edge of the walkway is a sheer 
drop but offers a good view of the rocky ground below and the 
Keep and fortresses climbing the canyon walls.

Crenellated Battlements Against A Cliff Face~
   The exceptional architectural finishings of this defensive 
wall are clearest here, where several sculptures of kings or the 
like have been set into the rock wall rising to the south and 
marking the end of the fortification. They are faded and in some 
cases broken with sword marks or mace marks. Below over the gaps 
in the wall, the Mettalmar market can be seen and the 
Slaughterhouse beyond, but westwards a rising trail can be seen 
where the Dead Pond laps against a tiny dock.

A Narrow Underground Tunnel~
   Air gusts in through the wide opening to the south, but it is 
far from being fresh. Instead, it brings along the scents of 
rot, filth and decay, along with the heavy stench of putrid 
water. The tunnel is damp, but a number of orcs seems to linger 
here frequently, searching through the shops located in this part 
of the Pits. Eastwards leads a wooden door with a 
crudely-painted arrow marked on it.

one of the numerous punched out knot-holes in the stone. From

A table full of tools has been set up in the center of this 
building for the shop owner to stand behind and a rough mat has

A Damp Tunnel With a Crude Wooden Floor~
   Walls of this tunnel are not formed of solid rock, but of 
damp, muddy dirt and clay. In order to spare the boots and feet 
of the poor-looking orcs wandering here, someone had laid a 
number of wooden planks across the floor, which are now 
half-trodden into the soft underground. Wooden beams and 
supports lean crookedly over the tunnel, rusty nails and thick 
woodsplints threatening to snag at the clothes and skin of those 
passing through.

Inside a Cluttered Pawn Shop~
   A dozen of crooked wooden steps lead down into this small 
chamber which cramped due to the number of racks of shelves 
lining the walls. The woodwork of the furniture is poor, simple 
planks hammered together without much regard to esthetics. There 
is a confusing jumble of goods stored on the shelves, making it 
hard for anyone to find anything particular and instead forcing 
the customers to pick through the heaps of useless junk in order 
to find something of a real use or value.

A Disorganized Orkish Shop~
   Pieces of armor and weaponry are thrown all about this store 
in a disorganized jumble with no apparent order or design. The 
shop remains dark at all hours of the day, no natural light 
seeping this deep underground. Even with the clutter the shop is 
still big enough to fit a dozen customers inside, but very few of 
them are human and the orcs of various sizes form the majority of 
visitors. The floor of this shop is built out of layered pine, 
marked with many scars and dents where a weapon or a piece of 
armor had been unceremoniously dumped.

A Dingy, Orkish Tool Shop~
   A section of the caverns has collapsed here, creating a small, 
uneven room that is now occupied by an orkish shopkeeper. The 
nooks, alvoves and shelves created by the jumbled pieces of 
rubble have been used to store a number of various tools and raw 
materials needed by workers of all sorts. Everything is covered 
with filth and dirt, and it can be suspected that anything coming 
from this shop would retain the characteristic stench of decay 
for a long time.

On Your Way To The Fortress of Egthela~
   You are about to commence in the Slave Halls with nothing but 
basic clothing and a slave collar. Shipped in from the east, 
slaves are always needed by those with power in Egthela, the 
Mordor fortress you arrive at. Perhaps you will be snatched up 
by the orcish Arena Boss and try your luck as a gladiator. 
Perhaps the Easterling Balchoth will take you in to serve them. 
Perhaps the Haradrim Reflected Moon Clan will press you into 
slavery. 

Whatever happens to you, life will be hard and you will need to 
win your freedom or die as a slave in the face of the harsh truth 
of Mordor life. If you want to be cuddled and cared for, choose 
another sphere. If you are tough enough to survive long enough 
to make an impact in the Mountains of Shadow, you are welcome to 
try. Your first master is Lord Nathron, the Priest-Lord and his 
Slavemaster will ensure you are kept busy or auctioned off to the 
highest bidder should you show promise. Work hard and show what 
you are capable of and you can earn freedom through coin, Arena 
fighting or military contributions to the war in North Ithilien 
against the Gondorian Army and northmen of the Wetwang town.

Emerging from a wide hole large enough for wagons to pass, you eventually reach your new home and are shepherded roughly into the halls. You decide on your value. Will it be as a warrior, a crafter, or something else entirely? Whatever you decide, you arrive as a slave. Whether your spirit has been broken, or you come eager to aspire to a better life, for now you are in the slave market and you have only a little time to prove yourself worthy enough to be bought by one of the Egthela factions. If you don't convince anyone to buy you from the slavers then you will be thrown into the arena for the dogs. And in the mortal combat for life and death you will either perish to dust or rise to shining glory.

A Crude Tunnel Descending into Underground~
   Wide and tall, this tunnel has been hewn from the insides of 
the mountain with many strikes of picks, as is evidenced by the 
many marks and gouges lining the walls and the floor. Yet, some 
of the scars on the rock seem different from the others, and seem 
to be made by claws rather than tools. From the iron bars 
blocking the southwestern end, the corridor plunges down into the 
underground, the sloped ground making it somewhat uncomfortable 
to walk through. Several chains of no apparent use hang from the 
ceiling, the dampness of the air making them glisten with water. 
   A small door sits at the far western end of the tunnel.

A Private Altar Room~
   The weak light given off by the sconces along the wall pulse 
like a heartbeat and plays havoc with the shadows along the floor 
and wall that seem to dance to its rhythm. Bits of bone, skin, 
and other fleshy detritus litter the ground around the altar that 
sits near, but not against the back wall. All about the room, 
drawn in blood and red ink are murals of creatures being cut, 
slain, and augmented by dark beings stenciled in thick strokes of 
black paint. Along one wall are shelves full of items best left 
as obscure shadows in the light. The air within this room is 
thick and heavy with a feeling that threatens to bow your 
shoulders.

A Dark, Spacious Storage Room~
   This large chamber is irregular in shape, hewn out of the 
depths of the earth with more sense for utility and speed of 
completion rather than aesthetics. Shelves have been dug 
directly into the rock, providing for an ample storage space, but 
their haphazard placement makes organization somewhat 
complicated. A small doorway leads out westwards, a couple of

A Damp Underground Chamber~
   The ceiling of this craggy cavern slopes down from north to 
south, wetness glistening on its uneven surface. There is a 
narrow staircase cut directly into the rock and then a small 
stretch of uneven ground at the shore of a dark, cold pond which 
occupies the rest of the room. A perpetual dripping of water can 
be heard from many directions, causing an occasional ripple on 
the pool's surface, breaking its eerie calmness.

The Blood Watch Treasury~
   Piled high with coins as tall as the eye can see, this 
treasury room is not accessible by any mere mortal. It is full 
of all the Bloodwatcher's money and it is going to actually do 
good things in the long run, I hope. On the wall, there is 
scratched graffiti that reads, "Draxx was here".

A Sprawling Eroded Cavern With A Black Pool~
   Almost tubular in shape, this cavern has been eroded by an 
underground river in some ancient time until a shift in the 
mountains diverted the waters. Fault lines circle the cavern as 
grey rock glistens with moss and moisture. At the western end 
dark cracks run vertically out of sight above, slow trickles of 
water seeping down across black veins of iron-like rock and 
dripping heavy and dark into a deep pool at their base. The pool 
contains a pitch-black liquid, thick and possibly poisonous as it 
reeks of acidic tension. 
   Deep cracks appear in many directions here and small broken 
fissures lead from the pool to feed a great heap of bones and 
bodies. Black, throbbing tendrils of vein-like roots swamp the 
cavern, making a pulsating sound that echo throughout the area, 
recoiling from light with a heavier throb.

A Cramped, Dark Section Of Tunnel~
   Cramped and dark, this short section of tunnel would cause an 
average-sized individual to stoop, or even get down on hands and 
knees. It seems to have been scratched out from the stone, the 
ground stained black with an ichorous substance, yet it seems to 
open up as it leads further from the eastern chamber. The 
throbbing vein-like black roots have already started to fill up 
this cramped claw-carved bit of tunnel, making an odd humming 
sound, and slick to the touch.

A Musty, Stale-Smelling Length Of Tunnel~
   Space opens up in this length of the tunnel, far away from the 
light of day, and smelling quite stale and musty. The walls are 
rough and cold with dampness, seeming old and formed naturally 
without the aide of picks and chisels, save for a narrow cramped 
section that leads to the east and is obviously carved out from 
the stone. The underground passage leads on to the north, 
growing in height and width, allowing for more comfortable 
passage. Should one touch or examine the stone walls of the 
tunnel, dark vein-like tendrils throb on its surface, throbbing 
more intensely should they be touched by light, and slick to the 
touch.

A Weaving Section Of An Underground Passage~
   The underground passage starts to weave a bit in this area, 
turning its path back and forth, with the odd pool of built-up 
moisture having been formed on the stone ground. The stone 
ceiling varies in height here, perhaps causing some taller 
individuals to stoop to avoid head injury, black vein-like 
tendrils wisping from the stone surface to rub on the tops of 
travelers in the tunnel.

A Dark Length Of Tunnel, Leading North And East~
   Still and dark, the underground trail starts to straight out a 
bit, not having as many turns and twists as most of the stale 
tunnel. The walls are slick with a cold moisture, and the odd 
drip can be heard in the natural, near-silence of the passage, 
building up on the ground in a few shallows puddles of dark murky 
water, giving rise to a foul smell, and seemingly feeding black 
vein-like roots that sprawl about the whole of the tunnel.

A Rise In The Underground Trail~
   The ground here starts to rise as one travels the underground 
passage to the west, or starts to head deeper to the south. The 
ground is rough and bumpy, composed of the same dark, cold, and 
wet stone as the rest of the tunnel. A crevice has split the 
stone wall in one spot in this area as well, enough to fit a hand 
into, but no wider, with claw-like black tendrils filling it's 
space.

A Relatively Straight Underground Passageway ~
   The tunnel levels out for this length of relatively straight 
underground trail, heading roughly in an east to west direction. 
The air is not as heavy as the rest of the passage, and the 
ceiling is higher, causing for much easier travel. The odd 
dripping sound can be heard in the natural near silence of the 
surroundings, causing shallow dark puddles to form along the 
stone ground in places. Pulsating, black vein-like tendrils curl 
from the ceiling and walls.

A Narrow Opening In The Dark Tunnel~
   There is an easier flow of air near the mouth of this tunnel 
as it opens up to a sprawling eroded cavern, through a narrow 
crevice broken into the ground. There are a few roughened 
outcroppings of stone to offer foot and hand holds to climb up or 
down. Liquid trickles down the side of the opening, pooling in a 
shallow basin in the tunnel. Throbbing, black vein-like roots 
sprawl about wildly over the walls and floor of this section of 
the tunnel, much thicker than the rest of the underground trail.

A Widening In The Dank Tunnel~
   Opening up in height and width, this dark and dank tunnel 
offers a stale smell and damp, cold walls. It seems the further 
one goes from the eastern chamber, the more space there is 
available, still little more than enough to let a large orc or 
human to pass single-file. Drips can be heard in the silence of 
the tunnel, pooling up on the ground in shallow wet spots. 
Tendrils of dark, vein-like roots throb on the ceiling and walls.

A Length Of Almost Straight Tunnel~
   The air is stale and thin in this stretch of the tunnel, 
leading nearly straight as an underground trail goes from north 
to south. The ground however offers little regularity, rough and 
uneven with rises and drops all through the path. Outcroppings 
from the ceiling should give a traveller through this tunnel 
reason to take care, as they jut down to cause collision with the 
unwary. Along the path, dark vein-like roots cling to the stone 
walls and ground.

A Dank And Damp Secluded Chamber Cave~
   This damp and dank chamber is secluded from the rest of the 
huge underground cavern. The bottleneck opening has been barred 
by a thick door, and the rest of the cave has been burrowed out 
wide and to a height comfortable for most orkin. The floor is 
covered with filth and trash, the hacked and scratched stone 
walls layered with smokey film and grime.
