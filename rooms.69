A Steamy, Lavish Wash Chamber~
   Tiles of polished alabaster and lapis adorn the floor and 
walls of this room, the diverse range of hues of blue and white 
utilized to depict a sweeping seascape about the room, eddying 
swirls rising into crashing waves. Behind these tiles internal 
ceramic piping heat the floor and walls, a vent for periodically 
emitting dense, humid clouds of steam into the room. A wide 
basin is set into the wall near the ceiling, water constantly 
pouring over from its overfilled brim in a perpetual cascade that 
slips down in an even ribbon of water to a grate below. But 
central to the room rests a shallow but wide pool, large enough 
to comfortably accommodate two or three bathers, the water 
clouded a rosy hue from various minerals and herbs, filling the 
room with a refreshing fragrance.

A Makeshift Hospital~
   This open courtyard has been covered with several lenghts
of tarp and canvas, sustained by long wooden beams, 
apparently scavenged from collapsed buildings. Many 
makeshift bunks and beds have been set on what was this
courtyard, filled with injured men, mostly soldiers. The 
screams and whimpers of the men are almost unbereable, 
a pair of trestle tables set up near the dilapidated entrance to 
the house to act as chirurgery ones. A pair of Healers tend
to those wounded, and the place reeks of the sweet smell
of blood, pungent urine and lingers of death. A wall has been
demolished and a door, probably from a destroyed building,
set on it, allowing entry to whatever room it keeps behind.

A Large, Modestly Maintained Living Room~
   The northern door of dark, rich wood is bolted with iron 
hinges to the shadow-cast wood panels which form the majority of 
the framework for this modest cottage. The entrance opens 
subsequently onto a large room although its use is clearly 
multi-purpose judging by a few work units, shelves and cupboards 
situated to the west of the room and a small, dark-grained table 
of wood to the east. Thin torches of dark iron, which have been 
fastened at regular intervals around the edges of this room, cast 
flickering, dull light over the objects and spider webs and 
general dust cling to the various small nooks and crannies 
between the windows and their neighbouring wooden panels. A thin 
dark carpet of midnight black leads from the northern entrance, 
southwards into what looks like a small bedroom, accessible via a 
small wooden door and a more petite, less easily accessible 
wooden door is situated past some furniture in the south-eastern 
panels of this multi-functional room.

A Dimly-Lit Private Room~
   Dirty panels of dark, rich wood have been laid out rather 
neatly to create the sturdy floor of this private bedroom. Aside 
the window which casts forth rays of light, in the daytime 
period, over the rooms usually dingy interior, are a few shelves 
scattered with books amongst other objects and a wide pedestal 
sits comfortably beside a clean-linened bed. A single iron torch 
has been set into the eastern wall to provide ample light when 
the hours of darkness fall over this modest cottage and various 
drapes, tapestries and paintings of Stewards past adorn the 
thickly paneled walls of this somewhat confines. A well-crafted, 
richly stained desk sits beneath the southern window which looks 
out onto the streets and buildings of Osgiliath some distance 
off, and its presence accentuates the rooms comforting, yet 
almost dingy confines.

A Simple, Private Bedroom~
   Through a petite door of rich, cobwebbed dark wood in the 
western wall, lies a somewhat multi-functional room. Panels of 
similarly dark, worn wood have been set as sturdy floorboards and 
a few thin rugs have been scattered in disguise of various 
marrings. A neatly-framed window hung with dirtied spider webs 
casts forth rays of light over this dingy interior during the 
daylight hours and draped about the walls are simple tapestries 
and paintings of Stewards past and a simple iron torch to cast 
flickering, ample light over the room come sunset. A simple 
stool of wood sits alongside a bed of clean linens and more 
noticeably, a rich desk of dark grained wood sits beneath the 
eastern window, making the room less spacious and therefore 
somewhat welcoming.

Inside a Huge Iron Aviary~
   In the middle of the courtyard, this aviary sits, relatively 
heavy iron bars forming a criss-crossing pattern of the cage. 
There are many wooden perches and constructed trees in here, on 
which many score of pigeons sit, cooing loudly amongst each 
other. A white-painted roost with an access door is in the very 
middle of the cage.

A Dank, Featureless Underground Room~
   A dank, musty and putrid smell wafts through the stuffy air of 
this dimly lit, wide-surfaced cellar. A retractable staircase of 
craggy, splintered wood provides access from the iron-banded 
trapdoor above, to root firmly into two carved niches of the 
mottled, cold stone floor. Ash grey cobbles have been set firmly 
into the wet earth below ones feet and its expanse is somewhat 
wide and certainly plain. The only decoration of this reclusive, 
dingy interior is perhaps only seen in the stale water droplets 
that fall from the hardwood ceiling above to catch the flickering 
orange light of the iron-grated torches which cast forth over the 
cellar to glimmer dark, sinister shadows of what sparse furniture 
is set on the floor. Save that, the copper and ochre-brown 
moulds transfused with sickly greens hue the stone walls in a 
morose fashion.

Liza's Hardware Storage~
   This cluttered storeroom is lined with shelves bulging with 
every manner of imaginable tools and impliments. Crates, bins 
and barrels are strewn haphazardly across the sawdust covered 
floor. There are no windows and the room is clean. The floor is 
covered with sweet smelling rushes.
