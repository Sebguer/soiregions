sharp spike of metal raises from the top of the hammer, obviously 
used for quick, close quarters jabbing, adding to the menacing 
look of the weapon. The shaft of the weapon is solid metal as 
well, strange runes adorning its length, gleaming oddly when

flame periodically spurt out from the shutters and door of the 
farmhouse, and anyone intent on entering the blaze faces 
near-certain death.

perimeter of this fort, at the top a wall of fire-hardened, 
tar-blackened stakes rising half a dozen feet. Inside the 
roughly circular fort, a small tower has been built, of the same 
raw, fire-proofed logs as the outer wall.

#6Orcs and goblins wearing a skull-painted patch of the Gothakra Warband move across the battlements.#0~
   A gathering of armoured orcs is here, each armed to the teeth 
with an assortment of knives, scimitars, maces, flails and other 
vicious weaponry. The orcs range in height and build from the 
short and wiry to the tall and massive, and each bears on its 
left shoulder a patch displaying a crude-painted skull. They are 
armoured mostly in leathers and ringmail, covered with various 
fangs and bones and shards of flint.

   All of the orcs in this group bear many scars over their 
bodies; testament to the bloody rituals for which they are known. 
They range in height and build, and are outfitted in ringmail and 
leather armour, adorned with various shards of bone, tooth and 
metal. Each is armed to the teeth. Upon every orc's left 
shoulder is a patch bearing the image of a crudely-painted empty 
eye-socket, the device of the orcs of the Twisted Eye of Khagdu.

stone, ancient and marred, has been patched with shifts of wood, 
the entire wall replaced in some sections with fire-hardened, 
tar-blackened stakes. Inside the squarish fort, a small tower 
rises out, of the same patch-work construction as the outer wall.

An archaic full-helm with long, runed tusks has been left here.~
   Crafted flawlessly out of an extremely high quality steel, 
this archaic full-helm has been left a smoky color. The texture 
of the helm is smooth, even though into the steel deep angular 
runes have been carved, along with a light etching of scales. 
The full-helm's long noseguard and wide cheek-guards come 
together to form a mask over the wearer's face. Long, runed 
tusks extend out from the face mask, and a short pyramid-shaped 
spike has been set on the top-middle of the helm.

closes just below the neck with the aid of two dark bronze discs, 
and a bronze chain which connects the two.

carving birch girl PFANDUR WOOD~
a birch carving of a girl~
A birch carving of a girl running with outstretched arms is here.~
   This is a small carving of a teenage girl. The object is 
slightly larger than the palm, but stil abe to be easily held in 
the palm. The dress flows backwards as if blown by the breeze, 
one outline of a kneecap extending out. There is a large 
billowing cloak behind the running girl, extending behind her. 
It has obviously been created by an unprofessional, as seen by 
the large gash in the cloak, giving that section a tattered 
appearance. The arms are outstretched, reaching for something 
just beyond them. The girls' face is one of overall happines,, 
but there is a small nick on one ear and the ears are not 
completely algined. The hair of the gorl flows out behind her as 
if she is running or it is being blown by a gentle wind. The 
whole thing has a somewhat rough apperance, not created by 
masterful hands. The whole figure sits on a large, circular base 
with an F carved in the bottom of it.

A tattered strip of faded green cloth has been folded here, embroidered with silver thread.~
   Seemingly cut from a banner, this aged strip of cloth has seen 
its share of distress, its ends wildly frayed. The strip has 
been dyed a verdant green, now faded, and is stitched with an 
elaborate rectangular border of golden-brown thread. At the 
centre of the band, the image of a sceptre has been sewn in a 
silvery fiber, wreathed in a circle that bears Tengwar sigils of 
Arnorian origin, no longer decipherable.

   The long, sturdy blade of this weathered longsword is 
fashioned of dark grey steel, its edge notched with use, but very 
keen. The blade tapers into a sharp point, a deep fuller running 
its length from the base to tip. The crossguard is straight and 
unadorned, but for the etching of a seven-pointed star at its 
centre. The long hilt is bound by riveted leather, dyed a glossy 
black, and ends in a flanged pommel of steel, wrought with sigils 
of Westernesse.

   A gigantic pair of arms and legs emerge from the spire of rock 
half way along its underbelly, twitching and writhing 
spasmodically, covered in scars of all sorts and colours. The 
skin is a dusky black, the same shade as a massive, trap-jawed 
metal helm that emerges too from the rock just above the arms, 
and from within it periodically comes rasping, muttering, 
whimpering sounds. On the other side of the rocky spire, two 
skinny legs hang limp, and the upper half of a pudgy goblin, who 
when not silent cries and mewls, scratching at the air before it 
with its bloodied and fingernail-less hands.

A chainmail hauberk is crumpled on the ground here~
   Pliable, light pelts have been sewn into a lining for this 
sturdy hauberk. They are uniformly white in color, contrasting 
nicely to the tarnished, interlocking chainmail rings that cover 
it. The chainmail itself is formed into a vest shape, protecting 
the shoulders to the thigh. Pauldrons of mail sewn onto thick 
plates of hardened leather protect against downward strikes. 
Small utilitarian buckles are present, allowing the attachment of 
further pieces of armor. Emblazoned proudly in the center of the 
vest is a hawk, talons outstretched. The pelts give excellent 
protection from the elements, while the chain is well suited to 
it's role of protection.

shields front, yet most noticeable is the emblem - painted in 
black ink is the image of a large hawk, talons outstretched 
towards an unseen victim.

   This circular torc is made of thick silver and iron wire that 
has been spun to form the body of the piece. It is meant to sit 
around the base of the neck, with its opening facing front, a gap 
between the ends. Due to its construction, it can be easily 
stretched open and closed without stressing the metal too much. 
It widens toward its back, tapering to either end. Each end is 
widened slightly to accommodate the stylistic form of a hawk.

A small caltrop, its prongs sharp, has been camouflaged on the ground.~
This small, solidly made item is clearly designed to be set over 
the ground, to cause injury and delay to anyone foolish enough or 
unaware of its presence over any stretch of terrain. Basically a 
small, wide base from where three sharp iron prongs sprout, 
this caltrop is nothing but three nails welded together to a small 
iron square. Almost two inches long, the nails have been given 
a decidedly wicked sharpening, which makes them evidently 
able to pierce almost any type of sole or boot. Their small size 
would allow these caltrops to be planted and hidden easily, 
delivering a painful surprise to those stepping on them.

A bedraggled bunny rabbit toy with blood-stained fur lays here on the ground forlornly.~
This small stuffed rabbit is about the size of a man's hand, made of rabbit fur that has been stuffed with wool. The once-soft, brown fur is matted over in places with bits of a black substance, recognizable to as blood upon further inspection. The spot where the whiskers once were is devoid and empty of all save one of the little thread lines. The stitching on one of the small, dark-button eyes is beginning to loosen, giving it a rather hangdown and forlorn expression. Stitched in careful letters atop the rabbit's head are the letters, in Numenian-Tengwar, 'Narthanwen.' The effect of the once-soft and cuddly toy's transformation into this thing is both repulsive and endearing all at once.

a number of holes in each end of it. Fairly thick and offering 
moderate protection to the throat, it has an etching of the White 
Tree riveted to it.

A polished, well-kept display case stands here.~
#1You can see how to interact with this armband with #6help display-case#0.
A sturdy stand constructed out of mahogany wood and
polished to a high sheen stands here. The top of the
stand spreads out into a rectangular box with a glass
plate allowing people to view the contents. Beautiful
scrollwork climbs up the side of the case in the shape of two
white trees, each coloured and detailed with expert care.
Upon closer inspection, one may even make out the details of
each medal by examining the medal-number. Just below the glass
display is a drawer, where extra medals can be stored and
retrieved easily.

a silver sphere~
A silver sphere has been carelessly abandoned here.~
   This silver sphere is for adding Shadow or Iluvatar affects to 
a room. You can add shadow by doing #2addrmaffect shadow <time> 
<intensity level>#0 or add Iluvatar (which prevents shadow from 
spreading to the room) by doing #2addrmaffect iluvatar <time> 
<intensity level>#0 e.g. #6addrmaffect shadow -1 1#0 adds a 
permanent shadow of intensity 1. You can also remove shadow by 
doing #2removeaffect shadow#0 or iluvatar by doing #2removeaffect 
iluvatar#0.

A small chunk of broken quartz is half-buried in the mud.~
   Flecks of dark matter are buried within the white crystalline 
structure of this piece of stone. Its upper ridges are smooth to 
the touch, worn by weather and time. Bits of earth still cling 
to its underside.

hook gauntlet _UNIQUE_ _Calathen_ _Icarus_ _Niphredil_ LEATHER~
a thick leather gauntlet with a hook~
A thick leather gauntlet ending with a hook rests here.~
   This prosthetic was clearly created to replace someone's lost 
hand, created from what appears to be a leather gauntlet. A 
heavy iron hook thrusts from the the wrist outward, taking the 
place of the lost appendage. A pair of leather straps and 
buckles wrap around the item, allowing it to be tightened or 
loosened to fit properly. Within, a lightweight fabric has been 
sewn to the leather to provide padding for the wearer, while a 
metal cap braces the hook so that any weight or force put against 
it is spread over the entirety of the gauntlet. Near the 
forearm, a small metal plate has been riveted to the leather, the 
White Tree engraved on it.

A thin vein of pale stone winds into the rest of the rock.~
   This incredibly thin vein of pale crystalline rock looks as if 
it grips the brown rock parasitically; sinking inwards as opposed 
to being exposed to light. The mud and dirt upon it mostly 
conceal it from view, but here and there, a glint may catch on 
the light.

   Throughout the area, bodies are strewn; ravages of war. 
Pierced and sliced to shreds, some still boast the weapon that 
landed the killing blow, the wielder too beset upon to bother 
retrieving it. Arrows litter the region and porcupine out from 
some of the dead figures who have drawn their last breath in such 
a misfortunate location.

the bodies of many orcs~
The bodies of many orcs have been strewn across the battlefield.~
   Layered in a thick coating of black blood, the bodies of 
numerous orcs and goblins and even the rare troll may be found. 
Stabbed and sliced, gouged and gutted, some these remains still 
bear the weapons which slaughtered them, sticking out like 
enormous toothpicks from macabre hors d'ouevres. Many have lost 
body parts and where faces are seen, sightless eyes and 
open-mouthed cries have been stilled through that allmighty 
silencer War. The corpses spread around are a gruesome testament 
to the the battlefield.
