a worn wool rug, $drabcolor in colour~
Spread out across the floor here is a $color wool rug.~
   This rug is rather large, frayed edges and loose stitching
showing its age. The coarse wool has been dyed, perhaps once a 
fine pigment but now the rug is $drabcolor in colour. 
Nonetheless, the rug is thick and still usable.

Set here in the middle of the Great Crossing is a large milestone, made from a black, igneous rock.~
   Most likely made from basalt or some other volcanic rock, this
milestone has been set in the direct centre of the Great Crossing,
where the three great roads and the path to Minas Tirith meet. It
stands roughly eight feet high, and has been worked upon so that
its edges run straight up and down, a towering black monolith.
Engraved into its black surface and dyed with starkly contrasting
white ink is the following message in the Numenian-Tengwar Script,
read in the tongue of Westron.

fluidly, widening along the arm until reaching the fingertips. 
Delicate silver-embroidered vines creep up from the hem, some 
almost reaching the waist.

   Much skill and effort has gone into the construction of this

willow tree, shaped to curve inward slightly at the center to fit 
more comfortably within one's hand. It has been carved with the 
images of sea waves ringed around the handle while the rod itself 
where the line is attached to a notch has been fashioned from 
green hazel. Light-weight and well balanced, this fishing rod is 
ready for action.

A forest-green fletched arrow lies here.~
   The shaft of this arrow is nearly a yard long, and fletched 
into the end of it are numerous feathers dyed stiff with green 
paint. The tip is of sharp iron, yet it has been made to be dull 
in colour, not to hold the light and shine to give away its 
user's position.

a large, slate-grey rock~
A large, slate-grey rock juts out from the floor of the forest here, loose stones piled around its base.~
   Rising taller then the head of the average sized man, this 
rock is shaped like a crude monolith, jutting out from the ground 
of the birch woodlands. Slender branches of the trees have 
wrapped around the peak of it, and moss covers the slopes of its 
figure. A dull grey in colour, not unlike that of slate, many 
loose pebbles and stones have gathered around the base of the 
rock, lichen and mushrooms spreading through them.

An ancient shortsword, its bronze pitted and scratched, has been left here.~
   The blade of this sword measures two feet in length, smelted 
bronze having been used to form its shape. Numerous small 
indents can be seen running the entire length of the blade, and 
the edge is rather blunt. This shortsword has no cross-guard of 
any description, and the hilt is a simple piece of rounded bronze 
in a similar condition to the blade. The balance is mediocre, 
but this weapon is far too ancient to survive the tests and 
tribulations of combat.

   Designed to be used in the smoking of pipe weed, this pipe is 
of extremely old design and make, with the body extending out 
nearly half a foot and the bowl rather small. It has been built 
from the bones of a whale, scrimshaw, and meticulous effort has 
been undertaken to carve tiny pictures of dolphins and other sea 
creatures along its surface. The faint remnants of blue and 
black inks rubbed into the bone can be seen in the carvings, time 
having worn away at the strength of the colour.

its smooth, round handle and thick square shapped crossguard. 
Its handle has been wrapped in red leather to offer a better 
grip, and its light weight makes this an ideal weapon in close 
quarters. The oddest thing about this weapon is that instead of 
a having a straight blade like a normal dagger, this is composed 
of four thin iron rods that have been sharpened, then spaced an 
inch or so apart for maximum damage effect. It is truly a 
vicious looking weapon.

   The iron of this sword has been smelted in a mediocre manner, 
far from the finest blade available but able to hold a sharp 
enough edge. A wooden handle with two straight cross-guards 
allows the sword to be held and wielded, a bronze pommel at the 
end of the end of the grip providing a good balance with the 
blade. Thick, green leather strips have been applied over the 
handle. The pommel has been left a dull bronze, and allowed to 
tarnish slightly to give off a greenish tinge and to stop any 
kind of light to reflect off of it. The blade has also been 
covered in some sort of oil that makes it look dull in the light.

smooth, and wrapped in thick, green leather strips, which offers 
a good grip to the holder of this weapon. The pommel, also made 
of bronze left to tarnish, has a small, many branched tree 
engraved into it, signifying its use.

A mass of twisted trees has been piled here, their branches

An engraved, iron-bladed falchion lies here.~
   Fashioned from tempered iron, this weapon's blade is 
reasonably long and thick. The blade itself lacks a tip like 
most swords of its size, meaning that it has been designed 
specifically for chopping movements. The blade joins with a 
narrow bronze crossguard which offers minimal hand protection. A 
short leather-wrapped birch hilt joins with the crossguard and a 
small bronze pommel, which gives the weapon some weight as well 
as aesthetic beauty. The blade has been engraved around the 
crossguard with a flame-like pattern.

   This dagger, made from steel seems to be of good quality and 
expertly-made. The blade has been made purposely thick and left 
unsharpened because the dagger is primarily for parrying other

offers further protection to the wielder's hand. A long, 
carved-hardwood hilt wrapped in oily black leather joins with the 
crossguard providing the wielder with an ample grip.

   This longsword, made from fine steel, has been crafted by a

rounded brass pommel which gives the blade perfect balance as 
well as some physical beauty. On either side of the blade, the 
white tree of Gondor has been carefully engraved as well as a 
smaller pair of crossed swords.

cloaks and capes to ensure they stay draped over the bearer's 
shoulders. Engraved onto the surface of this clasp is the figure 
of a mighty warhorse.

its crescent-shaped guard. The handle is wrapped in leather, and 
the weapon's size and weight is ideally suited to one-handed 
hacking and slashing techniques; however, a desperate fighter can 
grip the pommel if need be for stronger attacks.

A large construction is taking place here in the distance, a banner of a White Tree upon a field of black flying above.~
   Visible in the distance, men are working here on a new 
construction of some sort. A large pile of stone has been 
brought in, along with stacks of lumber. The workers work night 
and day, large braziers keeping the area alit. Standing sentinel 
nearby soldiers can be seen, likely keeping a watchful eye upon 
the work - to come any closer would risk getting their attention. 
A black banner flies high above the work site, a white tree 
emblazoned upon it.

black ink is the forward-facing head of a grizzly bear, its jaws 
gaping in a fierce roar.

tightly in leather to afford its bearer a firm hold. Its blade, 
of a fine steel, widens to a vicious, razor-sharp crescent, the 
metal curving into two sharp points at the top of the weapon and 
just below its grip, lending an air of danger to the weapon.

hedge maze growing green VEGETATION~
a growing maze of green hedge~
Low green hedges have been planted here and are growing over a large area.~
   Carefully arranged here is a large number of hedges. The 
shrubs stand at about the height of a man, and the soil beneath 
them is recently-disturbed, hinting that they've only recently 
been transplanted. They have been carefully arranged so that 
between the closely-growing hedges is a series of intricate 
paths. This is quite obviously a hedge maze.

a lightly-embroidered, voluminous $color robe~
A $color linen robe lies in a heap upon the floor.~
   Crafted of soft $color linen, this robe shows a deft touch 
with a needle. Voluminous sleeves drape downwards, tapering from 
elbow to wrist to enfold the hands. The sleeves fall just past 
the hands of the wearer, while light scroll work embroidery lines 
the arms from shoulder to elbow. The waist of the robe is held 
closed with a $colour sash and the material expands outwards from 
the sash, enveloping the legs down to the wearer's ankles. A 
deep hood lies easily between the shoulders, ready to shield the 
head or shroud the face should the need arise.

A large ring of many stones makes up a circular firepit here.~
   Many stones have been arranged here in a circle to form a 
firepit. The ground has been dug down slightly, and about the 
rim smooth, rounded river rocks have been set closely together to 
form an unbroken ring. A few ashes lie within the center of the 
pit, remnants of a past fire. Around the firepit are a number of 
places for one to sit: overturned logs, stumps, and large rocks.

The corpse of a stately, granite-eyed young man is lying here.~
   It has a minor cut on the right elbow, a minor laceration on 
the right thigh, a small perforation on the right shoulder, a 
moderate laceration on the right knee, a minor hole on the groin, 
a minor laceration on the abdomen, a minor puncture on the 
thorax, a small stab on the left shoulder, a small stab on the 
left forearm, a moderate cut on the right hip, a minor hole on 
the right calf, a small puncture on the right shoulder, a 
moderate laceration on the left hip, a minor hole on the thorax, 
a moderate cut on the right shoulder, a small hole on the right 
hip, a small stab on the thorax. Last but not least is a massive 
hole in the right thigh that goes so deep, you can see the bone 
when the leg is exposed. The body has been cleaned, and the 
blood still left in the body at this time has since dried up. 
The flesh seems white in colour, yet a soft hint of rosewater 
hits the nose, speaking of a corpse that has been prepared to 
rest for a few days time.

a brown leather animal harness~
A large pile of leather straps and buckles lies here.~
   To the uninitiated, this is simply a twisted mess of buckles, 
straps, and grommets. When placed on a horse or mule, however, 
it makes more sense. A large, padded collar goes around the 
beast's neck, which in turn is connected to a strap that goes 
around the chest, behind the forelegs. All of this is connected 
to straps that go around the hindquarters of the animal. Once 
the harness is in place, the animal can be used to pull carts, 
logs, plows, or any other implements.

It seems rather simple in make.

   Stretching for the lenght of the vineyard field, several rows

driven on the earth, supporting the trunks of the vines. Thin 
wires have been stretched between stakes, where the tendrils of 
the vines grow with health. Shade is everpresent under the 
vines, thanks to the wide and thick leaves that grown from the 
woody vines.

to disturb the sense of flow of the braidwork and obviously meant 
to be worn facing outwards, displaying the device.

top of the band.

   A long, stylized candle is prominent upon the upper surface of 
this ring, the taper lit and the flame burning. Small drips as 
of wax running down the lenght form small protrusions from the 
otherwise smooth surface of the ring. The tin hoop is the mark 
of the Fellowship of Chandlers, the low grade material a marker 
of the relative lack of prestige of the Fellowship, despite the 
vital role they fulfil.

   A mark of the prestige of the Fellowship of Clothwrights, the 
detail work on this sterling silver ring is impeccable. The 
craftsmanship on the spool and needle emblem on the top of the 
ring is so flawless that individual strands of thread are 
apparent, and the eye of the needle is visible. A thin band of 
silver loops from one edge of the emblem to the other and is 
sized for the pinky finger, to keep it out of the way of the 
fingers required for delicate needlework.

grey colour. It is incredibly weighty for its size, being made 
entirely of thick iron. It comes to a bulbous top, though the 
spherical top of the ring has been shorn off flat. Upon this 
flattened surface, a wooden barrel has been stamped, complete 
with the engraved boards and iron banding rings. Though not an 
elegant ring, it is a fitting symbol for the Fellowship of

   At first glance, this ring of tin appears much like any other 
braid work ring. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes 
apparent that the braiding of the ring is reminiscent of the look 
of rope. This is further enforced by the fact that the ring does 
not make a complete circle, but rather a broken one. One end of 
the ring is a small knot of rope and the other ends in a frayed 
end. Though the ring is of humble origins it is the mark of the 
Fellowship of Cordwrights.

almost mirror like qualities. It is the same quality steel that 
the great masters of the Fellowship of Weaponsmiths use in their 
making of the fine blades of Gondor's armies. The band of steel 
is thick and strong, nearly half a centimetre wide, as it sweeps 
from one side of the ring to the other. In the centre is a solid 
steel sword, brightly burnished, and with a tip so finely cut 
that it would likely draw blood if an errant finger were pricked 
by it.

There are no scratches or marring upon the smooth surface of the 
silver, and it continues in a solid circle and is sized for the 
pinkie finger. There is only one adornment upon the ring and 
that is a needle, in miniature, upon the top surface of the ring. 
The needle, symbol of the Fellowship of Embroiderers, is 
carefully detailed, even a small hole for the eye present.

sphere of flawless blown-glass that is cradled by a triad of 
bronze prongs. The pale green of the orb contrasts beautifully 
against the deep tone of the pure bronze. The orb itself is 
flawless, perfectly spherical and without and bubbles or flaws in 
the glass itself, a testament to the skill of the Fellowship of

It is a single, wide band of solid gold, the burnished colour 
catching and reflecting even the smallest amount of light. To 
make this ring even more remarkable, it is embossed with a raised 
band of sterling silver that runs around the whole of the ring, 
atop the gold, right around the middle. The design is the unique 
marking of the Fellowship of Goldsmiths, unoccupied by any other 
jeweller.

the top of the ring is set a meticulously worked, four pointed 
leaf shape in thin, beaten gold. The detail work of the leaf is

itself is a likeness of the athelas leaf, the symbol of the

   The silver lily atop this ring seems to grow out of the band 
itself, opening up delicately from the base. The flower is done 
in great detail, the stamen of the flower set amongst the 
miniature petals. The band itself circles from one side of the 
lily to the other, tapering down from each side to connect at the 
thinnest point beneath. The lovely flower is a fitting symbol of 
the Fellowship of Horticulturists, responsible for the care and 
growing of such flowers in the most famous gardens of Minas

   The bronze band of this ring is fairly plain, though well 
crafted, the metal strong and polished to a light reflecting 
sheen. The part of the ring that more obviously draws the eye, 
however, is the silver tankard, symbol of the Fellowship of 
Hostelers, that has been skilfully joined to the bronze hoop, 
hardly a weld visible. The tankard is an image of the standard 
pewter tankard found in any one of the hundreds of inns in 
Gondor, and is detailed right down to a small bit of foam 
slipping over the brim.

   This ring is heavy, thick, and unadorned. Upon closer 
inspection though, the ring presents a smooth surface, so smooth 
as to almost be slick. Light is reflected perfectly from the 
surface of the ring, and there is no hint of a flaw within the 
extremely high quality metal. The band itself is comprised of 
two semi-circles - one of polished iron, and the other of 
lustrous gold. Such rings are borne with pride by the members of 
the Fellowship of Metalsmiths.

silver is set along the length of the band, in a complicated knot 
pattern. This knot patterns swirls up into a set of prongs that 
holds a flawlessly cut, highly rare blue diamond.

workmanship. Atop the ring is an emblem of a stretched hide in 
bronze, the symbol of the Fellowship of Leatherwrights, sits atop

of the band itself is of no great width, and tapers slightly

key is of the heavy, three toothed variety, such as is used in

   This ring is made out of the same material that most of the 
works of the Fellowship of Potters are made out of; clay. It is, 
however, a highly artistic piece. A flowing, trace work pattern 
has been filled in with a luminous white glaze. The main body of 
the ring is glazed in an even royal blue colour, causing the 
white of the tracery to stand out beautifully. Atop the ring is 
a meticulously sculpted rendition of a potter's wheel. It is a

present a very complete depiction.

   This ring is made of fine, heavy gold, and is quite large. 
The bulbous top if very wide and has been flattened. Upon this 
surface the image of an open tome is graven, the book resting on 
its spine with pages facing up. The detail of the work is quite 
great, the individual sheets of paper that compose the pages 
etched into the metal. The graving is quite deep and recessed, 
and the cold that it is set in quite flat around the edges, 
indicating that this ring is likely used as a sealing-ring, 
stamping documents with they symbol of the Fellowship of Sages.

quill to the trailing end of the feather, even the barbs of the

the width of the band itself. The adornment of a crossed hammer 
and chisel adds to the weight, both instruments being made out of 
the same fine silver as the band of the ring. Large and heavy 
looking, the tools are the kind used in the craft of the 
Fellowship of Masons, and serve as the Fellowship's symbol. The 
chisel is thick bladed and comes to a sharp edge, while the 
hammer is more a mallet, thick and blocky.

other, made entirely of copper. The band upon which the scale is 
set is made of copper as well, and though not fancy, is well kept 
and polished to a low lustre.

   Made of plain, though well polished, brass, the circling band 
of this ring is not overly decorative. The most eye-catching 
part of the ring is the small square of ceramic tile set into the 
top of the brass loop. It is cut and shaped masterfully into a 
perfect square with bevelled edges. The glaze on the ceramic is 
magnificent, the lustrous deep-red complimenting the shine of the 
brass band. Though an odd piece of jewellery, it is a fitting 
symbol for a member of the Fellowship of Tilers.

Curiously, the tear-drop is made of lead, adding quite a bit of

be worn pointing towards the hand, creating the effect of a drop

sturdy pack large LEATHER PC_CRAFTED~
a large, sturdy pack~
A large, sturdy pack with a tree embossment has been left on the ground~
   This sturdy pack has been fashioned of thick, worked leather 
and reinforced in all the corners and stitches. The base is made 
of shoe-sole, and the exterior waxed to insure that its contents 
will remain dry even under inclement weather, coupled with the 
thick flap used to close it. Two wide straps allow to wear the 
pack comfortably over armor, and two exterior pouches give an 
even large storage. An fire embossment of the White Tree reveals 
this item is originally produced for those in service to the 
Steward of Gondor.

A small, sturdy cage with a handle has been placed down on the ground~
   Made with a frame of wood, this small cage is sturdy and, by 
the handle on top, portable. The bars seems to be placed close, 
yet they are set with enough distance to indicate that the 
animal, possibly a bird, contained within, is not minute. A 
small door on the side allows for the retrieval of the creature.

larger piece of quartz. The rock is flanked on all side with a 
bronze rim, which gleams dully whenever light hits it. The piece 
is well-crafted and sturdy, and it lends an air of sophistication 
to its surroundings.

   Forged of fine steel and given a watery, bluish tint, this 
longsword is obviously of fine make. The edge is honed to a keen

the crossguard. A fine chain is set around the grip, allowing a 
firm hold to be kept on the piece.

   This horn is made of a short boar's tusk, hollowed out and 
cleaned thoroughly. The outside is an off-white color, which has 
been scraped and smoothed out. The horn extends about the length 
of a hand, and carved into the tip is a small figure of a tusk 
with a sigil next to it. The lip has been plated in copper, and 
two simple bands run along the length of the horn on opposite 
sides to the mouth of the horn. The mouth has likewise been 
crowned in copper, securing the horn from cracking. On the lip, 
a leather thong has been strung through an eye, as to secure it 
around a person's neck for ease of use.

and constructed of a darkly-stained wood. The finish shines dully,
having a smooth and well-polished surface. Numerous notches and
dents mark the staff, although they've been carefully sanded down
as to attribute to the sleek appearance. On each end, it has been
slowly narrowed down on each side for the last foot, lending it
an appearance akin to a two-headed paddle. The flattened tips
have been capped in beaten copper for a few inches up the haft.

flaming inferno consumes anything in its path, endangering 
anything in its reach. Only the most brave would dare combat the

Despite looking battered, apparently all of the buckets in this

impossible to distinguish the origins of the remains, as the fire 
and apparent effect of the water used to quell it fragmented and 
broke the original flammable substance that must have fed it. A 
strong burnt odor permeates the surroundings.

the opal has been inlaid with a white-gold trim. On the inside

inside of the band, beginning and ending at the tusk.

the front, the dark threads forming a gently swirling design 
which compliments the burnished metal buttons. The two shallow

upper garment is meant to be too close-fitting for anything to be

A $color cloak is piled here in a lump.~
   Fashioned in a usable, yet not extravagent manner, this cloak

ankles of its wearer, and a long, deep hood is sewn into the back 
to offer further protection from the weather. At the neck, it 
has been set with a shiny silver clasp, which glints attractively

Fastened into the crown of the cap, running from the nose to the

openning have been affixed with jagged, rusted barbs which add to 
the overall grotesque character of the helmet. Patches of rust 
are visibly intruding over most of the visible surface.

a leaf green cloak with a sword-and-star symbol~
A leaf green cloak with a deep hood has been left here, a sword and star symbol marked upon its back.~
   Sewn from thick wool, this cloak was designed to match the 
colours of a woodland surrounding. Its billowing cloth has been 
waterproofed with pine-tar on the outside. Tough enough so that 
its dark green form can protect its wearer from the worse of the 
elements, it also holds a deep hood for even more warmth and 
shielding. Upon the back of this cloak the image of a sword 
before a seven-pointed star, the symbol of Greathouse Astirian, 
is sewn in with a tan embroidery.

a pitch-black embroidered tunic~
A tunic of pitch-black has been folded here.~
   Thick wool of fine weave has been used in the production of 
this comfortable woolen tunic. No collar tops this garment, 
instead the neck is shaped into a V shape, three buttons of 
polished bronze running down to just above the sternum on its 
wearer. The long sleeves reach down easily to the wrists, the 
cuffs flaring outward slightly as they end at the base of the 
hands. A splendid, pitch black dye has been used to color the 
wool. A clever pattern in silver has been skillfully embroidered 
from the V of the neck, down to the waist in a tapered fashion. 
Close inspection reveals the design to be similiar to elven 
runes, but are in fact mearly patterns sewn to resemble such.

the armband a rose is embroidered in deep red, clearly meant to 
be worn facing outwards.

lined in fabric of a slightly darker shade hangs some distance 
down the back; when raised, it allows the wearer to remain both 
warm and anonymous. A simple but striking silver-plated cloakpin 
fastens it shut against the elements. An edging of royal blue 
fine linen has been added with great skill.

borders the neck, stiff, and pressed flat against the squared 
shoulders of the coat. The narrow sleeves broaden into large 
cuffs, folded back from the wearer's wrist. An iron-buckled 
strap, designed to clasp the coat shut, has been stitched to its 
back, and dangles from either side when left unfastened. Two 
large pockets have been sewn onto the inside of the breast of the 
coat as well.

gleaming, yet surprisingly light, and clearly non-metallic. Care

scales on in exact alignment with the segmented leather.

grapes cluster mature green reserve fine VINTNER OTHER~
a cluster of mature, fine green grapes~
A cluster of fine, mature green grapes have been neglected on the ground.~
   This cluster is pretty large, being twice the length of a 
common man's hand. The grapes are light green, and seem healthy 
and savory. With a sweet taste, these grapes are the ones 
commonly used for wines produced in the Anorien region of Gondor. 
Unlike the more common kind of grapes, these seem fresher and 
firmer, possibly the effect of some effort made to turn these 
into a more valuable fruit.

a somber-hued painting~
A painting done with somber colours and setting lies on the ground here.~
   Light bouts in this painting, but shadow prevails for the most part.
Dark, skeletal trees claw out from a dismal landscape, reaching their
branches like talons: the object of their desire, a black stallion with
its head hanging low, carrying upon it a cloaked figure. Slow, its paces.
Loose its reins. Hooded and masked, its riders mantle is as dark as
midnight and features entirely obscured. The way it is slouched suggests
it might be injured or pained, and behind it its shadow stretches to
mingle with that of its great steed, forming a singular beast ever
looming in the background. No sign of green grass. No speck of life.
Just the ever dim hue of lingering twilight breaking though a gnarled
canopy and wickedly twisted roots.

a polished engraved longsword with a brass handguard~
A polished engraved longsword with a brass handguard has been discarded here.~
   The steel blade of this longsword has been carefully polished, 
leaving it with a soft silvery sheen. A brass handguard curves 
around the leather-wrapped handle, connecting to a large bulbous 
pommel at the very tip of the sword. Of obvious high quality, 
the finishing touch is an engraving of the image of a sword 
before a seven-pointed star on the blade near the hilt.

A sturdy-shafted spear with tassels lies on the ground here.~
   A sturdy shaft of ash-wood comprises most of the length of 
this weapon. A long, tapered spearhead made of well-forged iron 
has been secured to the end of the shaft quite efficiently. 
About six inches below the spearhead, a series of tassels have 
been tied, consisting of leather strips, feathers, and wooden 
beads. Supple leather has been wrapped about the shaft at one 
point farther down to provide a more secure grip.

a keen-edged, leaf-bladed longsword~
A keen-edged, leaf-bladed longsword lies here.~
   Forged of silvery steel, even the smallest amount of light 
glistens on the surface of this graceful weapon. Three fingers 
wide at the cross guard, the blade tapers very slightly inwards 
before widening again after a short span, forming an elegant, 
leaf-bladed shape. At the tip of the sword, the edges dip 
sharply together, forming an acuate stabbing point. The blade is 
always razor keen, appearing as if the sword has been recently 
honed to a perfect edge. A set of elegant sigils are set upon 
the blade, entwining the weapon from the crescent shaped cross 
guard to the very tip. They shine brilliant silver, seeming at 
times to glimmer with a light of their own. Leather wrapped for 
a secure grip, the hilt of fine, dark maple is balanced by a 
teardrop shaped pommel, which provides the sword with near 
perfect balance and heft.

breastplate UNIQUE_PGLINADUIAL gleaming banded mail ELVISH_QUALITY METAL~
a gleaming, banded-mail breastplate~
A faintly gleaming, banded-mail breastplate lies here.~
   This plate mail breastplate is composed of long, two-finger 
wide strips of silvery steel. Running from ribs to shoulder on 
either side, four bands crisscross at the centre line of the 
breastplate, forming the shoulder and chest pieces. Further 
bands are riveted to the bottom of these, forming the same 
diagonal pattern as the armour extends from the chest to the top 
of the thighs. Each strip overlaps the one below it slightly, 
forming a flexible yet comprehensive layer of steel that allows 
the wearer full range of motion in the torso and evenly 
distributes the weight of the breastplate. Overall, the armor is 
highly protective while retaining the maximum amount of mobility 
possible. Standing out in contrast to the steel is a line of 
cursive script in a lustrous silvery metal, which runs from the 
lower right and curls around the back of the armor, ending just 
below the left shoulder.

a luminous, star and flower emblazoned kite shield~
A tear-drop shaped, silvery-steel kite shield lies here.~
   Taking the form of a long, upside down teardrop, this kite 
shield would easily cover the bearer from the neck to just above 
the knees. Several thin sheets of durable steel, joined together 
at the edges, form the body of the shield. With a concave design 
intended to deflect blows away from the bearer, the shield 
gradually tapers downwards before forming a point at the bottom. 
Upon the face of the shield is set a many-rayed star, shining 
above a delicate niphredil flower. Luminous, silvery script runs 
along the rim of the shield, starting from the middle on one 
side, curving along the upper edge and down to the midway point 
on the opposite side. For its size, the shield is exceedingly 
light and easy to wield, while also being exceptionally resistant 
to any blows or marring of its finished sheen.

   Crafted of a steel alloy, this chainmail vest does not appear 
to be the work of human hands. Delicate and seemingly joined 
without a seam, the rings that make up the vest are tinted a pale 
green and woven through with a thin thread, both the colour of 
new leaves. When worn, the vest is very light and the rings seem 
to offer only a whisper of sound when they brush against each 
other.

to be no seam where the rings join each other in their long rows, 
unlike similar works made by human hands. Composed of a steel 
alloy, the sleeves have been tinted a pale green color, 
reminiscent of leaves in spring.

   A work of artistry and masterful craftsmanship, these boots 
are formed of two layers of rich, deep-brown leather. The 
interior layer is supple and very soft, lined with velvety rabbit 
fur to provide superior comfort and warmth. The thicker outer 
layer has been meticulously hardened to strengthen the boots, 
encasing the wearer's foot protectively when worn. An intricate 
design of climbing ivy has been tooled upon the exterior, twining 
from the boot's toe to where they end at mid-calf and then dyed a 
foresty-green. Shapely and contoured, these boots have obviously 
been custom tailored, fitted for one particular wearers foot.

backwards sweeping, leaf-shaped plates, one shielding the back of 
the hand and the other encircling and protecting the forearm. A 
young birch tree is engraved upon the gracefully backswept 
plates, sinuous limbs reaching up to cradle the entirety of the 
gauntlets. The design of the gauntlets provide a great deal of 
protection to the hands and arms while leaving the fingers their 
full range of motion for archery or other tasks.

   The gleaming gray-steel of this shoulder-guard has been beaten

obviously high-quality materials and is easily seen as the work 
of a master. Atop it, rendered in high detail, is the look of a 
rose with a twisting stem, thick thorns jutting from it. The 
image seems to emphasize both excessive wealth and a rather 
threatening demeanor.

A leaf green cloak with golden trimming lies here, a sword-and-star symbol embroidered upon its back.~
   Sewn from the finest, thick wool, this cloak was designed to 
match the colours of a woodland surrounding. Its billowing cloth 
has been waterproofed and it is tough enough so that its dark 
green form can protect its wearer from the worse of the elements. 
A deep, cowl-like hood has been affixed to the back, providing 
even more warmth and shielding for the wearer. The side and 
bottom seams of the cloak have been trimmed in a gold, thread 
roping, marking the wearer as a powerful figure of the Wardenry. 
Upon the back of this cloak the image of a sword before a 
seven-pointed star, the symbol of Greathouse Astirian, is sewn in 
with golden embroidery.

long and rectangular in shape with strong, thick straps of 
leather on the back for an easy, yet sturdy grip. It is curved 
slightly to better deflect blows and offers reliable protection. 
Skillfully engraved across the centre of its surface is a 
longsword before a seven-pointed star, the symbol of the 
Greathouse Astirian, and the recesses have been darkened to bring 
out the detail.

a majestic, hand-spun tapestry~
A majestic, hand-spun tapestry hangs reverently here.~
   Spun of the finest thread with remarkable skill, this tapestry 
is the work of a master's hand. It is sized to dominate a wall, 
a regal banner flowing down in flawless white framed in deep, 
royal burgundy. It details a scene of glorious triumph, with 
bold symbols. Anor rises to the east, its golden ball detailed 
in fine embroidery... and casts a solid light of pure white down 
upon the scene. It is of a hillock and wilderness, the most 
prominent figure a towering elm of unrivalled glory and age. 
It's leafy boughs hang in a regal canopy, shading the bed of 
yellow, bell-shaped flowers growing in a thick carpet around its 
base. There remain no shadows, no hint of darkness. At the head 
of this tapestry, looking down over everything is an august stag. 
Its great legs are wrapped in vaporous clouds and its frame 
bathed in light. The pure white hart stands defiantly and its 
crown of antlers vast and proud are both wicked and assuring. 
The rendering of this animal is done with particular care, 
detailed to breath-taking pains. The image is a testimony to 
meticulous and unyielding vision, bold and proud.

An elaborately taxidermed, short-brown haired Dachshund is here~
   This elaborately taxidermed Dachshund has been made from the 
the very finest of specimens, which has been treated with the 
very best of glossy-dog shampoo, and possible some expensive coat 
enhancing dog food. The tail serves as the handle and the legs 
have been splayed out to the sides, serving as a kind of make-do 
crossguard. This Dachshund is far from perfectly weighted, 
tending to be heavier towards the head, which has an expression 
of stupid joy upon it. When taxidermed, this Dachshund was 
possibly made to be caught in the act of catching a ball, tongue 
lolling out to the side, and head turned back slightly to look at 
the incoming bally goodness.

blackened flamberge double edged Heartbane BYBONES PC_BANKS METAL~
a blackened, double-edged flamberge~
A blackened flamberge the length of a man lays here, collecting dust.~
   The pommel is a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to 
balance the long blade. It is carved into the likeness of a 
snarling wolf's head, with chips of garnet set into the eyes. 
The grip is virgin leather, soft and black, as yet unstained by 
sweat or blood. The blade itself is a good five feet long, 
tapered to thrust as well as slash, with three fullers deeply 
incised in the metal. When turned sideways, ripples in the dark 
steel can be seen where the metal had been folded back on itself 
again and again whilst its edges have been well kept, sharpened 
and oiled regularly.
