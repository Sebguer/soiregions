Gatehouse~
   This square shaped gatehouse has been built into the adobe 
walls being about midway through from one side to the other. 
Either side has been barred by large fortified gates which are 
constantly watched by the men stationed inside. A latch has been 
set into the gate to allow the watchmen to peer outside while the 
portcullis has been solidly fortified and placed to serve as a 
secondary defence should the gates be breeched. The ground has 
been laid with cut slabs of stone giving it an orderly and 
disciplined look.

A Paved Road Entering Fahad-Jafari~
   The road is carefully and neatly paved in white stone bricks, 
making for a smooth, easy street to follow whether by foot or in 
a cart. The smooth flow of people quickly stalls here as some 
are halted for one thing or another before exiting the city gates 
to the north, and others are merely loitering, pinned between 
those pressing southward. Several street vendors have set up 
shop, and their cries can be heard over the general din of 
people.

A Busy Intersection~
   White stone bricks pave the road along this way in a neat, 
simple pattern. And despite the high level of traffic that runs 
through here, the dirt and debris is often swept out of the way 
by a slave. The street eventually forks into multiple 
directions. Much of the crowd hastens toward the Souk, the 
sounds and sights quite visible to the south, while the elaborate 
gates to the east remain fairly quiet. The well-traveled road 
also slips off to the west.

Entrance to a Busy Souk~
   Crowds of market-goers surge in and out of the entrance of the 
souk, their paths slowing as it takes them toward the road to the 
north. A constant buzz of voices, some bartering and others 
trading gossip, fills the market area, broken now and then by the 
occasional, sudden cry. The entire souk is paved in pale stone, 
each tile unique in shape and size, but providing a leveled 
pathway.

A Corner of the Souk Filled with Sweet Scents~
   The market is cornered here by the buildings which comprise 
the shops of the souk. Their white clay-brick walls are accented 
in awnings of bright colors, their windows hung with festive 
curtains. The sound of merchants, hawking their wares, seems 
louder here as their voices echo off the buildings, mingling with 
the general buzz of the shoppers. The sweet smell of freshly 
baked goods fills the air here, overwhelming all other scents of 
the souk.

A Quaint Side of a Busy Souk~
   Several merchants have set up their wares here, but none of it 
compares with the quaint shop that rests along the western edge 
of the market. Colorful glass fills the windows of the clean, 
white building, and its pristine white awning is decorated with 
brightly colored beads fashioned of glass which tinkle 
delightfully in the slightest breeze. The constant hum of the 
market drifts in from all directions of the souk, the sounds of 
hawking and bartering.

An Awning-Shaded Side of the Souk~
   Although not as crowded and noisy when compared with the rest 
of the market, an elegant, stately building rises to the west, 
bearing a large, gold and mauve striped awning. Small copper 
bells hang from the awning and sing out sweetly at the slightest 
breeze. Delicate desert flowers grow from mauve-glazed clay 
pots, which decorate the side of the building. Market-goers and 
merchants alike are often found loitering around, under the 
respite of the awning's shade.

A Crowded Souk Filled with Wood Scent~
   The crowds of the market surge through this section of the 
Souk, often stalled by shoppers who pause to stop at the shop 
along the western edge of the souk, either to view the wooden 
wares set outside or to go inside. The unmistakable fragrance of 
freshly cut wood hovers in the air, aided by the sawdust that has 
been inadvertently scattered over the pale-stone walkways by 
passers-by. The din of the market is embellished at times by the 
sound of hammering or sawing.

A Corner of the Souk Beside the River~
   Sweet floral scents fill the air heavily in this section of 
the market. Fresh and dried herbs hang in the open windows of 
the shop to the south, its shaded facade decorated by a small 
pool fed by the river and filled with flowering water plants. 
The pleasant sound of flowing water mingles with the constant din 
of the market. Crowds of shoppers and wandering merchants pass 
by on their way to completing their errands.

Section of the Souk Filled with Produce Stalls~
   Here, where many bright colored stalls and tents crowd the 
marketplace, the crowds press in close together as they maneuver 
around the merchant's wares and try to make their purchases. If 
the noise was loud before, it is even more so here as buyers and 
sellers alike lift their voices to make their barters heard, 
occasionally marked by the sound of coins exchanged. Produce and 
raw foodstuffs seem to be in plentiful supply as the scent of 
dust and fruit fill the air.

A Shaded Area in the Center of the Souk~
   The hustle and bustle of the rest of the souk seems to 
alleviate here slightly as most passers-by pause to rest under 
the shade provided by a large canopy. Four sturdy beams support 
a thin frame upon which large palm fronds rest, making up a good 
portion of the shade. Wandering merchants cut through here, 
often found taking a break from their endless hawking-calls. 
Even though a small respite, the constant noise of the rest of 
the market fills the air. Within the exact center of the area, a 
cool fountain bubbles into a shallow pool, offering fresh water 
and a refreshing rest.

   Obviously a main portion of the souk, buyers and sellers move 
through the area with determined purpose. Making use of the 
passing traffic, a few tents and merchants have dedicated their 
portable shops to this area, filling the market with various, 
colorful wares and stalls. The smells and sounds mingle here and 
offer a varied flavor of entire market. 
   A large red-striped pavilion tent sits here with its bright 
red flags blowing in the breeze.

The Souk Against the Riverbank~
   A narrow shop sits here, butting up against the flowing water. 
The river rushes along to the west, dark and cool. Visible 
around the sides of the building, swirling along the pale stone 
steps, which sink a foot into the water. The bustling sounds of 
the market intermingle with the calming sound of of the river, 
often broken by shouts of haggling. 
   A sign depicting a quill and inkwell swings above the portal 
of the narrow shop to the south.

A Tree-Shaded Corner of the Souk~
   Most prominent in this corner is a large fig tree set into the 
dirt and ringed by pale stone, its branches offering shade and 
shelter over a fairly large area to the passers-by. Several 
benches encircle the delicate trunk, offering a rest for weary 
legs. A picturesque view of the river which flows to the 
northwest can be seen from this vantage point, the bank lapping 
at the stone steps set to lead right into the water. The sound 
of the water rushing by is nearly drowned out by the regular 
noise of the market.

A Noisy Edge of the Souk~
   A well-frequented shop sits to the east of the souk, its white 
brick exterior somewhat faded by the constant smoke expelled from 
the forges in the back. The grey ash stains even the originally 
bright yellow awnings that shade not only the shop's door, but 
the merchants who have setup their wares beside the structure. A 
narrow stairway hugs the shop closely, leading up to a secondary 
shop above, where a wooden sign hangs, showing a detailed 
painting of a maned lion skin. Amidst the constant buzz of the 
bartering and hawking, the sound of hammering metal fills the 
air.

An Edge of the Clamoring Souk~
   The crowds hurry along this section of the market, although 
some are prone to stop abruptly and peruse the wares on display. 
The cries of hawkers fill the air occasionally to break the 
monotonous clanging that seems to fill the area. The smell of 
forge smoke pervades the souk here, its scent easily overpowering 
the sweet smell of the delicate, white flowering vines that creep 
up along the white building. Smoke billows from the back of the 
building; the result of a constant forge.

A Liquor-Smelling Side of the Souk~
   Crowds of market-goers and merchants ebb and flow over the 
pale stone-paved souk, the sound of their bartering and hawking 
filling the air. The eastern edge of the market is thinly 
shadowed by large, ruby red awning, attached to a building which 
wafts the unmistakable smell of brewing alcohol. The building 
itself is of similar architecture of the area, a simple structure 
of white brick.

A Crowded, Popular Corner of the Souk~
   Sitting most prominently in this corner of the market, a 
large, elegant building draws a great deal of business here, its 
white, stately architecture almost belying the humble clay from 
which it's made. The sound of music drifts out from the building 
at almost all hours of the day, drowning out even the constant 
hum of the souk. A pair of tall slender palms have been planted 
into a bed formed in the pale stone floor, flanking the door of 
the tavern. 
   A sign swings gently above the door to the north way depicting 
a blue water lily floating on the ripples of red wine.

A Road Leading East and West~
   Buildings line both sides of the street, the walls having been 
smoothed, but the edges of each individual brick laid in the 
construction of the buildings can still be made out. The road 
has been well-laid, consisting of sturdy stone, smoothed and laid 
by a well-trained hand, leaving the edges fitting evenly 
together. Heavy traffic moves through the street, bustling back 
and forth between the different sections of the southern parts of 
the city and souk. 
   The road leads west towards the housing of the city along with 
the industrial quarter and docks, leading away from the souk to

rising two stories high into the air. A large crest bearing a 
striking cobra adorns the gate, signalling the structure to be a 
barracks for the Silvermoon Cobra. To the north lay the gaol its 
sturdy door bearing a twin crest to the western gate. People 
move constantly along the road, most headed east from the 
industrial quarter and the docks. The road has been well-laid,

A Road Headed Towards Some Housing~
   The road winds south, leading towards the housing quarters for 
the merchants and traders then onward down into the industrial 
district. The street begins to open up here, allowing two carts 
to move comfortably abreast. The heavy flow of both people and 
carts come from either direction going about their business. A 
small trench has been laid on the eastern side of the road, used 
to drain both water and dirt away, ensuring the streets are kept 
clean.

A Road Turning Westward~
   A sharp turn in the road around a stout building is situated 
near the southern part, causing the traffic of the merchants to 
slow when needing to maneuver goods around the tricky corner. If 
watched long enough one would be sure to witness an accident of 
some sort. The road seems a bit more worn around the corner due 
to the extra strain coming from both man and animal. A small 
trench runs along the east side, seeming to disappear at the 
corner only to come out from beneath the road on the western 
side. 
   A cedar shingle swings from an iron brace above the door. It 
depects a traveling caravan carved into the thick wood.

A Split in the Road~
   The road comes to a pronged intersection with three roads 
leading in various directions. The area does open up to allow 
maximum comfort when moving animal and goods past the many others 
also using the roads. A narrowing road leads west towards the 
housing quarter of many of the merchants and traders residing in 
the city. Whereas the southern road is much broader, leading 
south towards the industrial district and the docks. To the 
east, the road can be found to turn sharply to a barracks and the 
city gaol.

Entering a Housing District~
   The large road from to the west begins to narrow, entering a 
more secluded part of the settlement. The noise from the road to 
the east is much quieter here as the settlement changes to a more 
urban setting. A small trench runs along the side of the road, 
carrying water and other waste and dirt away from the houses. 
Small plants have been planted on either side of the road adding 
both colour and beauty to the area.

   A broad road leads south towards the very active industrial 
area and docks. Noise can be heard further down the road from 
both merchants and labourers alike as they ply their trades. The 
road is almost constantly busy with various people moving to and 
fro. Along the sides of the road, plants have been set in boxes 
adding colour to the slowly changing atmosphere. Some distance 
to the north, a large intersection splits the road in various 
directions.

   A broad road leads further south towards the very active 
industrial area and docks. The constant din of noise can be 
heard from both merchants and labourers alike as they ply their 
trades. Regardless of the time, the road is almost constantly 
busy with various people moving to and fro. The eastern side of 
the road runs along the side of a large building, affording 
shelter from both sun and rain while also casting shade over this 
part of the street for the most part of the day. 
   To the east, a gate leads to a vast, noisy lumberyard, while a 
large door opens up to a large warehouse to the west.

A Road Leading to the Docks~
   The large road splits into a three-way intersection, heading 
north out of the area, leading to the docks to the south, or 
turning deeper into the bustling industrial district where 
tradesmen ply their trade. The atmosphere is lively and noisy as 
men go about their business of securing prices for their goods. 
As the roads farther into the heart of the district, they are a 
little more dirty with dust and soot that build up on the sides 
of the road, however the air is still clean and fresh. A 
well-traveled alley curves around the eastern building, closed 
off by a gate. 
   A wooden sign is tacked on the wall beside the woven reed door 
with black lettering is painted on a scarlet background reads: 
"The Akbar Trading Company".

Eastern Edge of the Industrial District~
   The road leads east towards the docks and out to the rest of 
the township, while leading west into the industrial district. A 
large, brick baking building boasts its location along this part 
of the road, where the clay bricks for both buildings and roads 
are produced. A narrow slice of an alley can be glimpsed between 
the buildings. Sounds fill the street as merchants further 
inside the district shout out prices and tradesmen play their 
trade. To the south, the dock and its workers can also be seen 
often bustling to unload cargoes.

Nearing the Docks~
   The well-laid stone road slowly begins to narrow to the south 
and then give way to a solid wooden walkway that leads out onto 
the docks. The smell of fish, preserved goods, and spices waft 
heavily from the wharf ahead. The buildings along the road to 
the south seem much further away, being soon replaced by the 
swirling surface of the river below. Railings have been put up 
on either side of the wooden landing leading towards the dock to 
ensure people don't fall into the fast-flowing water.

A Solidly Built Dock~
   The solidly laid oaken timber of the dock had been held firmly 
in place well above the water by huge poles driven deep into the 
bed of the river. To the north, the shores have been packed with 
large rocks, providing some protection for those on the dock and 
adding strength to the wooden structure where it links to the 
land. Crates and nets have been set around the edges of the 
dock, having just come off ships and left to be picked up by 
their buyers. Men bustle about the docks, loading and stacking 
various crates and moving them from ships to land and land to the 
ships. 
   A long barge is moored to the dock here, a brightly colored 
pavilion covering its expanse.

been unloaded from the ships and left to be picked up by their 
buyers. The workers bustle about, loading and stacking the 
various crates and moving them from ships to land and land to the 
ships. The air finds its way easily over the dock here, being 
unhindered by any structures. To the north, the buildings of the 
industrial district loom just inland from the shore with both 
smoke and fumes rising from the various buildings. 
   A sprawling tavern, its bar opening up to the riverside sits 
on the southern dock. A squeaking sign swings overhead with a 
likeness of a sailor laying before a door hugging an empty 
tankard.

   Large poles allow ships to be moored at the edge of the dock, 
while a small staircase leads slightly down towards the water to 
allow easier access to the wooden deck for those on smaller 
vessels. The noise all along the river can be clearly made out 
even here at the end of the dock. A cool, refreshing breeze is 
often blowing downriver, keeping it cool and well aired for all 
those upon it. Despite the fresh air, the various smells, both 
pleasant and foul, fill the nostrils as different goods are 
loaded and unloaded from the different ships.

A Road Outside a Large Warehouse~
   This broad road leads further into the industrial district to 
the west where both noise and dirt begin to slowly accumulate as 
merchants and traders focus on selling their goods. A large 
warehouse building is situated beside the road with large double 
doors set into the front. To the south, the dock can be seen 
along with the movement of the sailors and traders alike. The 
pristine colour of the set stone of the road has been smeared 
over time with soot and soiling, making it now an uneven shade of 
grey. 
   An imposing set of double doors lead directly into the 
warehouse to the south. 
   Stairs lead up the side of the building to the north, a small 
landing allowing access to a curtained doorway above.

A Road Leading through the Industrial Sector~
   The road continues to stretch in both directions, east and 
west, its once pristine bricks now smeared with soot and the 
passing of many soiled feet until the white colour has turned 
grey. Various open cooking fires have been built just north of 
the road, allowing passers-by the chance to catch the occasional 
aromas of freshly cooked bread or meat. Both noise and dirt 
slowly accumulate along the side of the road as merchants and 
traders focus on selling their goods. To the south, the dock can 
be seen along, and, beyond that, the flowing river. 
   A narrow wooden staircase built onto the side of the southern 
shop leads upwards to a wooden walkway.

A Road Edging the Forges~
   The road bends a bit to the south as it skirts around the 
forges to the north, moving a little away from both the heat and 
fumes. Yet despite the extra distance, the burning, smoldering 
smells of smoke and fumes can still be detected in certain 
weather as tradesmen work night and day over the scorching fires. 
It is obvious that little effort is made to keep the street tidy 
as with the rest other districts within the city. Tracked in by 
the many feet which tread here, dirt and soot form a thin layer 
over the once beautifully white stones that pave the road. To 
the south, through the river gates, the shimmering waters of the 
river can be seen flowing by, and a little to the east are the 
bustling docks that border it.

A Quiet, Dirty Plaza in the Industrial District~
   This intersection of the industrial district is strangely free 
of hawking merchants on the roads, as most of the visitors seek 
respite from the elements. The road itself hasn't managed to 
remain unaffected by the passing carts and people, who have left 
it stained and faded by carrying dirt with them. The noise of 
the rest of the area seems to somewhat be faded leaving people to 
be able to stand and watch the happenings upon the docks in 
relative peace before carrying on with their own business. A 
small well is situated here, flanked by a single, tall fig tree 
which offers a measure of shade and shelter.

A Road Leading Past the Forges~
   The road bends a distance around the forges to the east, in an 
attempt to keep both heat and fumes away from passers-by. With 
the forges being open and the view unobstructed, the labors of 
the various tradesmen working over the burning coals can be 
clearly seen. Both noise and dirt slowly accumulate along the 
road as merchants and traders focus on selling their goods in the 
distance. 
   A wooden sign to the west bears the image of a hawk, its wings 
stretched over a blazing sun.

The City Forge~
   The heavy scents of smoke and heated metal linger around the 
forges like an oppressive cloud for those unused to it. The 
extra heat generated by forge fires adds to the usually warm air 
of the desert. A large canvas canopy has been spread over the 
area in an attempt to offer shade and drive away the heat of the 
day, but on still days, it seems to do more harm than good, 
keeping the smells and heat trapped under it. The ground is 
hard-packed dirt, covered with layers of soot and ash that has 
been tracked around. Always bustling both night and day, 
craftsman can be seen hard at work at their trade, filling the 
ears with the sound of their toil.

district. Buildings line the road on either side, crowding 
against each other, their once-white bricks tainted with soot. 
On the western side of the road, a small door opens into a 
smokehouse, wafts of smoke can often be seen leaving the small 
building in plumes as its released along with the salty smell of 
preserved meat and fish. 
   A small canvas banner hangs over the doorway to the east, 
bearing the image of a butcher's cleaver.

A Winding Stretch of Road Through the Industrial District~
   The road curves between the uneven faces of the buildings that 
flank it on either side, the shops and warehouses crowding 
together. What was once pristine, white stone has since turned 
an uneven shade of grey as smoke and dirt have made their way 
through the industrial district. Sight of the river to the south 
is completely obscured, while an intersection can be seen a 
distance to the west. The noise from various merchants along the 
road can be heard calling out, mingling with the sounds of 
craftsmen plying their trade. 
   Rising up to the south is an old, stone warehouse, its 
multiple stories casting shadow over the road at many times 
during the day.

loud hawking of merchants that have come to take advantage of the 
converging streets. The western branch however has been 
blockaded off for construction, dark-skinned slaves laying down 
fresh brick for the road and the buildings that line it. The 
stones that pave this area have long been soiled in dirt and soot 
from the many feet that have passed by.

Cutting Through Grey-Stoned Buildings~
   Large, grey-stoned structures loom over this narrow street 
that cuts nearly a straight line through the industrial district. 
A few buildings appear to be shops, while larger ones with wide 
doors seem to be bustling warehouses. What was likely a clean, 
white-paved street has now been smeared with soot and grime from 
the many feet and beasts of burden that have traversed this 
stretch of road. The sounds of the hawking merchants and 
constant conversation echo over the faces of the buildings in a 
highly distracting fashion. A small wooden sign depicting an 
anvil and hammer swings over the southern doorway.

large doors opening out onto the road. A large canopy of hide 
stretches from the wall out over the road from the building 
housing the fighting pits, providing a decent part of the road 
with shade, where a few benches have been set on either side. 
The building has been laid with large stone, cut into bricks and 
seems much sturdier than surrounding buildings. The road 
continues west and east.

   The large, imposing city wall rises up to the west forcing the 
road to travel alongside it. Built of white, clay bricks, the 
houses crowd in close together along the southern side of the 
road. The architecture of this area is simplistic with clean, 
flowing lines and very little embellishments along the outside of 
the buildings. Helping to keep the district clean is a small 
trench that runs along the entirety of the road, draining water 
and waste away. Small, colorful foliage have been planted along 
the side of the road, adding to the beauty of the area.

falls under mostly shadow for much of the day, cast by either the 
wall on the western side or the houses lining the eastern side. 
Made from white, well-baked bricks, the buildings nearly form a 
wall of their own with only a break between them every few 
houses. A small trench runs along the side of the road, carrying 
away water, dirt, and other waste away from the housing district. 
Small plants line the street, adding color and beauty to the

A Road Leading Past Wall Access~
   The road continues in a straight path beside the sturdy wall 
with housing still following nearby on the eastern side although 
more sporadically as it comes to a gap in the wall. The wall 
opens up to the road with stairs leading to the top of the 
battlements. A small outpost has been built on the eastern side 
of the opening in the wall where solider can be seen regularly 
coming and going as the watches on the wall change their shifts. 
A significant break in the housing is present around the small 
outpost which has in turn been replaced by a small courtyard that 
can be seen from the road and many different plants. Two large 
willow trees have been grown on either side of the soldiers post 
providing both shade and beauty to the area.

A Sharp Turn in the Road~
   The road begins to turn away from the wall, making a sharp 
tight turn to lead back towards the centre of the township. The 
western side of the road is followed mostly by the walls of the 
township before being replaced by the well laid, white baked 
bricks which is so common around the area. On the east side of 
the road the buildings give way to a more open grassy area which 
compensates the sharp turn in the road allowing the traffic to be 
easily be returned to the road without much damage to anything 
beside or around the road.

A Road Leading Toward More Housing~
   Beginning to straighten out once more the road leads steadily 
to the east and west. Either side of the road begins to be once 
again repopulated by the sturdy structures of houses for the 
residents of the settlement. A small trench runs along the side 
of the road, carrying away water, dirt, and other waste away from 
the housing district. Small plants line the street, adding 
colour and beauty to the area. 
   To the west a small square peeks out from between tall palms. 
A beautifully twisted gate lies to the north, blocking entrance

A Road Winding Between the Houses~
   The well laid road moves east and west at an ever changing 
angle, twisting past the various houses that line the street. 
Shade is provided by both the walls of the buildings nearby the 
road but also from the small trees that have been planted beside 
the road that grow as tall as two men, with their branches 
spreading over the edges of the road. A small trench runs along 
the side of the road, carrying away water, dirt, and other waste 
away from the housing district. Small plants line the street, 
adding colour and beauty to the area.

Leading to a Housing Complex~
   Turning once again the road begins to lead southwards while 
also leading far into the distance to the west. To the south a 
much taller building than those on either side of the road here 
looms. The white baked clay bricks surround those on the street 
while also being an aspect on the southern end of the road. A 
small trench runs along the side of the road, carrying away 
water, dirt, and other waste away from the housing district. 
Small plants line the street, adding colour and beauty to the

Outside a Housing Complex~
   The road leads past a large building on the eastern side of 
the road. Two large fig trees have been planted on either side 
of the large wooden doors which open onto the road from the large 
brick-laid building. It reaches high into the air, with small 
open balconies built into the building where its occupants can 
gaze over the other structures in the area as well as passers-by 
on the street. A flower bed and wild lawn has been established 
around the large building complex. The road continues to the 
south and also north, leading reasonably straight forward.

A Street Snaking Around a Housing Complex~
   Leading both north and south, the brick laid road leads past 
white brick baked buildings that have been build solidly and are 
situated a little way from the modestly sized road. To the south 
a large intersection can be seen while to the north a larger 
building can be seen looming higher than all surrounding 
buildings. A small trench runs along the side of the road, 
carrying away water, dirt, and other waste away from the housing 
district. Small plants line the street, adding colour and beauty 
to the area.

   The main road ends here before a prominent, popular building. 
The stately structure's white bricks have been embellished by 
artful architecture and touches of bright color upon its facade. 
A wide door-less entry opens into the public bathhouse, offering 
their services day and night. The road has been tastefully paved 
here, a mural of white stone and blue tile decorates the large 
building's short steps and leads out toward the center of the 
road. Several houses also line the street, its windows filled 
with colorful curtains. Decorative plants line the street, 
adding color and beauty to the area. A small trench along the 
side of the road carries away water and waste from the area.

A Common Well at an Intersection~
   A pair of streets among the housing district intersect into a 
T here. A common well sits in the center of the intersection, 
drawing the residents of the area as well as a few merchants 
attempting to take advantage of the high traffic. Used for both 
drinking water and laundry water, it's not uncommon to see 
laundry being washed in the area. Adding to the colour and 
beauty of the district, a myriad of flourishing plants grows 
around the small square, fed by the washing water that overflows 
into the planters. Water and waste drain away into small 
trenches that lead out of the housing areas.

A Twisting Road Between Houses~
   The road leads towards the west and south. Just west along 
the road a large intersection turns the road in various 
directions while to the south a slowly developing road can be 
seen forming. Buildings are situated either side of the road, 
with their white baked clay brick walls facing the road being 
only broken so often by windows and the colourful curtains that 
have been hung by those living in the residence. A small trench 
runs along the side of the road, carrying away water, dirt, and 
other waste away from the housing district. Small plants line 
the street, adding colour and beauty to the area.

   While the street is fully paved and neatly constructed, many 
of the buildings along this way seem incomplete. The usual line 
of white-brick houses are broken in a few places with either 
empty lots or unfinished structures. Beautiful and colourful 
plants has been set along the side of the road. An inconspicuous 
trench lies at the edge of the street, carrying away water, dirt, 
and other waste away from the housing district.

decorated building. Two small trees and colorful flowers have 
been planted beside the building though they seem to have not 
been tended in quite some time and the doors to the building seem 
to be shut down. A large, peaked canvas canopy hangs over the 
doorway, casting a good deal of shade over the area. The road 
itself looks to have once been carefully paved though time has 
worn it down, with a few tiles missing all together.

   The regular paving of the road turns into beautiful white, 
granite tiling, bordered by pale rose-colored tiles, tall cypress 
trees, and brightly colored flowers. The trees offer minimal 
shade on the well-kept street. Shallow gutters along the road 
provide the means for dirt and water to run its way out of the 
district, keeping the area tidy. The entrance bears an 
exquisite, wrought iron gate to the west. And both sides are 
shaded by a white canopy of sturdy canvas.

   The wide road is beautifully paved with gleaming white granite 
tiles, bordered with pale rose-colored blocks. The tall cypress 
trees and colorful flowers that line the street add a lush, 
fertile impression to the district. Water and dirt wash away 
down the district via shallow gutters that edge both sides of the 
road. Lavish, walled manors line either side, each home spaced 
out by gardens and flourishing walkways. Evidence of their 
walled gardens can be seen in some of the manors' courtyards as 
vines or trees peek over the tall walls.

   White granite tiles meet at this intersection with a circular 
mosaic of bright colors. A golden figure of a cobra serves as 
the mosaic's centerpiece, its head poised to strike toward the 
south. Bright greens, blues, and reds encircle the serpent in 
flowing waves of color, its entirety bordered with black marble 
tiles. Shading swaths of white canvas hang from the bordering 
cypress trees, causing them to lean inward slightly and offering 
more decoration than any sort of significant shade. Narrow 
gutters follow the clean streets, drawing away water and dirt 
from the wealthy district.

   Carefully tended cypress trees border the white-tiled granite 
street, their stately leaves and trunk pruned and trained to grow 
in a spiraling shape. The road is kept clean and tidy, waste and 
water carried away in the shallow gutters that line either side. 
The road is narrower and quieter here than that to the north, 
leading into the heart of the lavish manors. The air smells 
sweet from white flowering vines that cling to the walls and 
delicate trellises, the scents mingling with the clean, cool air 
of the nearby river.

edges rounding out before the road splits into three direction. 
The white granite tiles border an expansive, detailed mosaic of a 
nighttime desert panorama. The gleaming tiles start to dip 
toward the center, where an elegant fountain pours water out into 
a shallow well. Tall, spiraling cypress trees grow close 
together, casting shade over the plaza during most of the day. 
Several scents fill the air from the various flowers that grown 
at the base of the trees, mingling with the clean air brought in 
from the nearby, flowing river.

waving border of blue-black marble edges either side of the road 
here, the shallow gutter being replaced instead by squat steps 
that lead directly into the water. The spiraling cypresses stop 
short of the curve, leaving an unobscured view of the sparkling, 
flowing water. The manors that line this street appear to be of 
the finer and more expansive buildings in the district, all of 
them within direct view of the river. The walls give way to the 
private landings and gates of the manors.

along with it the sweet, fresh scent of clean water mingled with 
the fragrance of blue water lilies. The blooms are visible 
growing at the river's edge, just out of arm's reach from the 
short granite steps that sink into the water. The granite tiles 
continue up from the water to pave the rest of the street, 
accented by a decorative blue-black marble border, patterned in a 
wave-like array. The grand manors remain along the northern edge 
of the road, leaving a beautiful view of the river.

simple marble fountain, elegant in its simplicity, sits in the 
center of the shade, surrounded by curving benches. The edges of 
the square plaza are bordered with multi-colored marble inlay, 
the tiles chaotically arranged in bright colors and angular 
shapes. Where the granite breaks to give way to soil for the 
grape vines, similar bright tiling also decorates its borders, 
but in more delicate fashion.

sales and timberwrighting fills the air with a near constant hum 
and bang. Raw logs all of various different kinds of woods pile 
up along one side, while the opposite end holds planks and 
boards. A small stable in the yard houses the beasts of burden

Fahad'Jafari Gaol~
   The white stone of this building keeps the heat of the 
southern day out. Cool to the touch the walls are some what 
rough. Stark and spartan save for a desk and stove, this room is 
swept clean and laid with fresh rushes. A shelf sits behind the 
desk. A stout door leads down with a heavy iron lock sitting 
beneath a large iron ring. 
   A sturdy iron staircase leads upwards.

Courtyard~
   This wide open ground is packed down, hard dirt. Various 
sparring rings line the eastern wall. Ropes hang along the walls 
edge. Lanterns hang from several tall wooden posts. To the 
north is a large wooden building with a set of double-doors. To 
the west, planked double doors lead to the stable. To the east 
the heavy iron gate is set into the surrounding adobe walls.

A Wide, Garden Courtyard~
   Bordered by tall cypress trees, this courtyard offers an edged 
overhang that shadow the doorways of the building around it, 
providing only a bit of shade. White bricks pave the straight 
walkways, its surface speckled with glinting reflections at 
times. The large manor house envelopes the courtyard, accented 
by solid supporting columns and formed by white, gleaming stone. 
Various plants, from sprawling vines to fragrant blooms, grow 
within the center strip of the courtyard, edging around the 
fountain and pond. 
   An arched doorway, fitted by a plain, dark wood door, waits 
under the shaded overhanging to the west. And a pair of white 
lattice-work doors opens to the north under a wide arched 
doorway. Another path leads around to the east, sheltered by the 
shade of a vine-covered arbor.

A Lush Flower Garden~
   Lush, vine-covered arbors and broad trees spread shade over 
narrow stone paths that wind through the garden. Vibrantly 
colorful flowers have been artfully placed in staged planters of 
gleaming white bricks. Their fragrance fills the air, mixed with 
the sweet scent brought in from the nearby river. The white 
stone path twists and turns around the planters and flower beds 
in seemingly haphazard fashion, splitting off in several points 
and eventually looping back together. Open latticework and 
bright, wide windows form the northern divider that separates the 
garden from main building. 
   One of the winding paths meanders toward a gate set into the 
southern edge of the tall, solid wall that surrounds the entire 
manor. Another path finds its way to a door made of star-shaped 
latticework, while the main courtyard lies just to the west.

An Airy Dining Room~
   The high ceiling and the latticework that comprises the 
southern wall give this room an open, airy feel to it. Smoothly 
polished marble tiles pave the floor in a diamond and hexagon 
pattern, reflecting the light on its pale ivory surface. The 
walls are made of cool, white stone and are left mostly 
undecorated, except for the mural that stretches the entirety of 
the northern wall. The mural depicts a desert oasis scene, with 
a mounted, black-skinned soldier accepting a waterskin from a 
white-clad dancer on the ground, her dancing silks blowing in an 
assumed breeze. 
   Opposing arches lead to the kitchen to the west and a sitting 
room to the east, while a beautiful lattice door opens into the 
courtyard to the south.

mural~
   Masterfully painted with meticulous attention to detail, this 
mural is that of a morning in a desert oasis. A Silvermoon 
Dervish soldier sits mounted on a horse with an ebon coat, as 
black as the man's skin. He is reaching out to a woman standing 
at his side as she holds a full waterskin up to him with one 
hand, her other hand resting intimately on his armored knee, 
while her brown curls and pearl-white dancing silks are caught in 
the unseen breeze.

Servants' Quarters~
   This long room holds an atmosphere of mostly utilitarian 
design. The white bricks that comprise the walls and floor are 
kept their original pristine color, obviously cleaned when 
necessary. The pointed, arched windows are fitted with 
latticework that serves both as shutters and curtains, allowing 
light and free flowing air in. During storms, a solid shutter 
can be fitted over the lattice. The ceilings are supported on 
thick wooden beams, plastered over with ivory to hide the rest of 
the wooden structure, leaving the support beams visible and 
darkly contrasted. 
   An arched doorway leads to the north, a narrow birch-wood door 
set within. To the east, another arched door opens to the 
courtyard. A blue-green door sits along a plain wall to the 
south.

A Large, Tidy Kitchen~
   Spacious and clean, this kitchen has been paved with grey 
granite stones, slightly pitted to provide less of a slip hazard 
when the floor is wet. The walls are made of white stone and are 
kept mostly clean, harboring a thin film of constant soot only 
where the cook fires burn most often. Wide, narrow windows sit 
high up with star-carved shutters that swing upward and can be 
propped up on a pole to allow smoke out or fresh air in. The 
kitchen seems to have been outfitted with all the necessary 
equipment to cook and bake a full course feast, having various 
cooking locations to racks and shelves. 
   A small trapdoor in the corner leads down a set of stairs into 
the cellar, while a narrow door made of birch leads through an 
arched doorway to the south.

A Sitting Room Open to the Garden~
   Cool, white stone forms the walls of this room, leaving the 
ceiling high on pale wood supporting beams. The floor is covered 
in decoratively geometric marble tiles, forming an elaborate, 
light yellow pattern. The southern wall of the room is made 
mostly of two large windows, open for an unobstructed view of the 
large garden outside. A delicate latticework door is set between 
the windows, casting star-shaped points of light on the floor in 
daylight hours. 
   The lattice door opens out into the lush garden to the south, 
while a large dining area can be seen to the west. An arching, 
white stone stairway leads up into the upper level.

A Cool Cellar~
   Walled in by cold, grey stone and set within the earth, the 
cellar ensures a near-constant cool temperature that preserves 
the supplies stored within. However, it is a limited sized room, 
between the storage structures of shelving and cabinets. The 
ground is cold, hard-packed clay and appears to be part of the 
natural lay of the land. The cold air is accompanied by a heavy 
dampness, no doubt contributed by the exposed earth. 
   Set into the clay floor and leading up to a trap door, a 
grey-stone stairway returns to the kitchen.

A Sumptuous Sitting Room~
   Cool, pure white stone forms this slightly rounded sitting 
room, the four corners curved to give the walls a softer edge. 
Ebony wood trims the upper and lower edges of of the walls, the 
wooden molding carved into gentle whirling waves. White marble 
paves the floor, the tiles appearing seamless if not for the 
spidery golden veins that form in telltale patterns. Black and 
red inlay weave a gracefully scrolling, flowering vine around the 
perimeter of the room. A plush rug of exceptionally soft 
cream-colored lambskin covers most of the center of the floor, 
careful not to obscure the marble inlay. 
   Three arched doors lead off into the bedrooms, the most 
elaborate being a set of ornate double doors to the south. A 
gently arching stairway along the eastern wall leads to the first 
floor, while a twisted set of steps sinks up into the ceiling 
toward a leaning trap door to the roof.

A Beautifully Appointed Bedchamber~
   Pristine white brick comprises the walls of this large room, 
accented by elaborately decorative stone molding along every 
corner in a spiralling pattern, broken at intervals by detailed 
carvings of water lilies. Airy silk banners have been threaded 
between the pale wood support beams along the ceiling, the gauzy, 
azure fabric rippling at the slightest stir of air. Two tall, 
narrow windows, barely enough to squeeze a man through, sit side 
by side along the northern wall, shuttered from the outside in 
unpleasant weather. However, in good weather, it remains open to 
sunlight and air, curtained by ample swathes of white chiffon. 
The faint scent of the blue water lily permeates the area at all 
times from some undetectable source. 
   An arched door has been set into the southern doorway, the 
wood carved elaborately with the figure of a flowering lily plant 
in water.

A Cheerful Children's Room~
   This brightly decorated room displays an impressive mosaic of 
ceramic tiles on the entire arching ceiling. The mosaic shows a 
likeness of the sun and wisps of clouds in one corner, the sky 
blue fading into darker hues until it becomes the night sky, the 
moon and stars shining in silvers and golds in opposite corner. 
Several pointed-arched windows stream light in during the day 
from the western and southern walls, shuttered perpetually by 
delicate latticework. The frames of the windows and the doors 
are made of a thick border of colorful mosaic tiles, but the 
white stone walls remain otherwise largely undecorated. Pale 
wood covers the floor, polished and treated to a dull shine. 
   An arched door sits in the eastern wall, leading out to a 
sitting room, while an azure blue door opens into the balcony to 
the south, its wood pierced with diamond shapes.

A Lavishly Decorated Bedchamber~
   Along the walls are white wooden, pointed arches set as frames 
for marble mosaics, the tiles each a delicate puzzle piece of 
minute shifts of hue of white and ivory to form elaborate star 
patterns. Conversely, the floors are made of simple white marble 
tiles, veined subtly with grey. Along the ceiling, swathes of 
midnight blue chiffon silk twist and billow out, flecked with 
golden threads that glimmer with every delicate stir of air. 
Frosted glass covers a bronze brazier that hangs safely from the 
ceiling, offering firelight during the dark hours. 
   A convex portion of the western wall boasts of a translucent, 
pearl white silk curtain that leads out to the balcony, while a 
small wooden door closes the closet to the east. An ornate, 
ivory-inlaid door sits in the arched doorway to the north.

A Rooftop Bath~
   Set upon a section along the flat rooftop of the building, an 
arched structure of white wood protects the area from the 
elements while still allowing a nearly unobstructed view of the 
city outside. Large, star-latticework panels rest along each of 
the four corners of the wooden frame, able to be expanded to 
close up the covering and create a more private room. A large 
pool sits in the center, reflections from the water casting 
patterns of light on the arched ceiling. An empty, bronze 
brazier hangs from the ceiling, cold and silent now during the 
day. 
   A short, sunken set of steps begins a quick distance from the 
covered structure, ending abruptly to a leaning doorway that 
leads to a spiraling staircase indoors.

A burning, bronze brazier hangs from the ceiling, filling the

reflections from the water casting golden patterns of light on 
the arched ceiling and along the bottom of the pool. A nearly 
perpetual haze clouds the surface of the water, evidence that the 
bath is kept hot at all hours.

A Balcony Overlooking the Gardens~
   Curving slightly to follow the flow of the building along the 
eastern and northern walls, the balcony is formed of white stone 
and pale wood and is styled in a fairly nondescript fashion. The 
white stone railing is high enough to reach an average man's 
waist and bears star-shaped holes at intervals. With an 
unobstructed view of the courtyard and a partial view of the 
flower garden below, the sweet scents from the nearby flora 
easily finds itself way here. 
   A curving, silken-curtained doorway leads into a bedroom to 
the east, while a sturdy, diamond-punched door sits against the 
northern wall.

The Public Smokehouses~
   Several wooden structures have been built upon the primarily 
dirt floor for the general use of the city's denizens. A 
frequent haze permeates the area with it fragrant smoky aromas, 
mingling the scents of salty seafood and preserved meats. Ash 
scatters along the hard-packed dirt floor and trails away from 
the smokehouses toward the start of the stone-paved road that 
leads off to the east.

The Communal Cooking Facilities~
   Carefully laid, red clay bricks pave this open area, keeping 
relatively clean from the sporadic tidying done by the city's 
slaves. Various cooking and baking utilities have been built 
here to contain the different fires needed to make a variety of 
edible goods. The air is often filled with scents both good and 
bad, depending on the skills of the craftsmen working at the 
time. The sounds of their labors mingle with the cries of 
merchants hawking their wares along the nearby road to the south.

Sweet Escapes Bakery~
   Spacious and pleasant, sunlight streams through the two glass 
windows on either side of the southern curtained doorway to keep 
the room well-lit no matter the hour. Flour and grain have found 
their way into the tiny cracks of the white stone floor, adding a 
speckle of color to the stone. White clay-brick forms the walls 
of this room, a splash of light yellow adding to the bright feel 
of the area. Numerous shelves and counters have been arranged 
around the room, displaying a collection of baked items and sweet 
foods, their aromas mingling together to overpower the room with 
a unique, indescribable scent. 
   A door to the north seems to lead further into the shop, and a

A Tidy Bakery Kitchen~
   A vent in the ceiling, able to be opened and closed with the 
assistance of a long wooden pole, provides light and air to this 
tidy cooking area. Sunlight from the window set in the northern 
wall sparkles through the flour dust that seems to hang 
perpetually in the air. The white clay-brick walls have been 
coated with a thin layer of soft yellow paint, lending the room a 
cheerful and open feeling, even with the collection of tables and 
other large objects that line the walls and fill the space. 
   A small door to the east leads into a storage room and a

   Small and dark, this room is lit only by a single lantern 
mounted on the wall by the western door. Shelves line every inch 
of available space, and a thin sheen of flour hangs in the air, 
leaving no surface untouched. Baked goods and sweets of every 
nature typically fill the shelves in this room, their scents 
mingling together to create a unique aroma that remains even when 
the room itself is empty.

the many colors. Many display cases offer storage space for a 
variety of goods, several of them designed to safeguard their 
wages from prodding hands. 
   A curtain of delicate glass beads hangs from the eastern

and work space has been build along the walls. With no other 
decoration other than a simple, thin-woven rug on the pale, 
yellow-ceramic floor, this room is obviously made more for 
function than decoration. 
   A door leads out to the shop front, while a smaller, solid 
door turns into a small stock room.

A Shelf-lined Storeroom~
   Although this room is small and plain, the unadorned white 
bricks that comprise the walls are lined with a multitude of 
shelves. Each shelf is railed with rope to help prevent its 
contents from accidentally toppling over the edge. The floor is 
paved with red clay bricks, kept meticulously clean. And a small 
oil lamp hangs from the ceiling to provide ample light to the 
room.

A Well-kept Jewelry Shop~
   Pristine white bricks have been used to form this tidy shop, 
simple in its construction and smooth lines. The bricks have a 
slightly gleaming quality that reveals itself when the light from 
outside or from the delicate oil lamps hits it just right. 
Several elaborate glass display cases and silk-covered stands 
have been placed about the shop in a decorative manner for the 
various wares for sale here. 
   A pale wooden door leads out into the bustle and noise of the 
souk, while another wooden door opposite must go into the back 
rooms.

A Warm, Airy Workroom~
   Plenty of natural light streams in from the large, barred 
windows set a little higher on the white-bricked walls, augmented 
by the light of several well-placed oil lamps. In one corner, a 
small forge has been built for the use in a jeweler's work, while 
a long work table has been built along the wall. Various storage 
fixtures have been placed around the workroom, offering ample 
organization space. The white tiled floor is bare except for a 
small piece of black rug set before the doors. 
   Only two doors lead out of the workroom, the one to the east 
turns out into the shop front, while a smaller, iron-reinforced 
door leads south.

solutions line the whitewashed walls and rise from the red-brick 
floors, each of a different size to accommodate jewelry either 
delicate or bulky and everything between.

A Crowded Woodcrafter Shop~
   The thick scent of wood fills this spacious shop, evidence of 
its wares. Built large and roomy, the clean, white bricks form 
an open room with two windows set along the eastern wall. Only a 
few storage containers and shelves are found to display wares, 
the rest of the shop open to display furniture and larger wooden 
items for sale. The floor is paved with grey granite tiles and 
is covered in a perpetual layer of fine sawdust. 
   The door that leads out to the souk to the east has been 
elaborately carved in wood, displaying a variety of desert 
flowers and animals and embellished by expertly carved 
scrollwork.

A Wood-filled Workroom~
   All the signs of woodwork fill this large workroom, from the 
scent to the sawdust and wood shavings. The brick walls were 
originally whitewashed, but have since been layered with a pale, 
sandy brown hue that gives the entire room a warm tone. Sawdust 
has been packed into the grooves between the white ceramic tiles, 
which are cracked in several places. A few small windows line 
one wall to keep air-flow moving through the room. 
   The door to the east leads out into the shop front, while a 
strong-looking door opens to a big storage room.

   Made of simple construction, this shop has little to boast in 
decor with its clean white brick walls and white tiled floors. A 
pair of small, long windows flank the entrance to the shop, 
casting the light from outside into the room and adding to the 
firelight of the oil lamps set along wall sconces. Several 
weapon racks and display cases provide ample space for the shops 
wares. 
   A pair of opposing doorways lead west into the busy souk, 
while the east goes into the shop's back rooms.

A Stuffy Workroom~
   The air in this room has a heavy, smoky quality to it, as the 
fumes from outside drift in from the small, decorative windows 
that sit high up along the northern wall. The walls are of plain 
brick construction, stained a hazy grey from the forge work 
outside, and tracks of soot and dirt have been formed along the 
pitted brick floor, beyond hope of fully cleaning. Ample work 
space is provided here to allow for the metal work that is done 
in here. 
   A thick wooden door to the west leads out into the shop front, 
while a small, well-used door sits along the southern wall. 
Dirtiest of all, a door opens out to the north.

it. This stockroom is of simple construction and right angles to 
form a narrow closet. A variety of storage and organizational 
fixtures were made to hold a good selection of weapons in as 
secure a manner as possible.

A Bustling Armory~
   Gently rounded corners and graceful buttresses on the ceiling 
have shaped this otherwise squared shop front into a circular 
room with an arched ceiling. The white bricks of the exterior 
have been plastered with an uneven shade of ecru, adding texture 
and depth. Rather than simple display bins for the shop's 
various wares, most of it is displayed on stands that hold full 
or mostly full sets of matching pieces. Brightly lit by a 
burning brazier that hangs from the center of the ceiling, the 
firelight augments the lack of light that filters in through the 
window slits along the top of the walls. 
   A beautiful, ivory and crimson striped curtain hangs in the 
doorway to the west, where the sounds and noise of the souk drift 
in with little hindrance. And a good, thick door is set in the 
eastern doorway, leading to what must be the shop's backrooms.

A Clamoring Workroom~
   The ceiling peaks here in a gentle dome shape, a cream-colored 
plaster covering the bricks that form the building's structure. 
A large hole forms the center that opens to clear skies and can 
be covered with a heavy canvas in stormy weather. It seems it 
was made to serve as both a light source and a vent for the smoke 
that drifts in from the south. The workspace between the pale 
grey walls is plentiful, serving the needs of the shop fairly 
well. The floor has seen quite a bit of wear, dirt and soot 
marring the faintly uneven stone surface. 
   A heavy wooden door sits along the north, blocking the doorway 
to a storage room, while opposite rests a filthy, smoke-stained 
door into a joint outdoor courtyard.

A Well-organized Storeroom~
   Plain and unadorned, white bricks create a solid, rectangular 
room for storage. The floor, however, has seen a number of nicks 
and scuffs over time, leaving the stone pitted and the once white 
color tainted to a faded grey in certain places. A number of 
storage structures have been built along the walls, each of 
various sizes to accommodate the wide range of sizes between the 
different armor pieces.

Joint Foundry and Forge~
   Tucked into a small courtyard between two buildings, this 
open-aired forge is surrounded by the walls of the structures 
around it. A small alley between them allows a view of the 
crowded souk to the west, but hardly enough space for a person to 
squeeze through. The floor is packed dirt, tainted black from 
the soot and ash generated from the hot forges. A fine mesh 
cloth hangs overhead, sagging in the middle, to offer minimal 
shade during the heat of the day, but serving little to protect 
from storms. 
   Two doors lead into the neighboring shops to the north and 
south, the sound of metallic hammering heard from each on a 
frequent basis.

Meandering Through Housing~
   On either side of this street nestle neat, white adobe houses. 
A narrow, dirt-paved alley slithers between two buildings to the 
north. A small trench runs along the side of the road, carrying 
water and other waste and dirt away from the houses. Throwing 
off their intoxicating scent small plants have been planted on 
either side of the road adding both colour and beauty to the 
area.

Passing By Neat Housing~
   Built of white adobe bricks, the houses on either side of the 
road give a clean and tidy impression. They are constructed 
close together and in some cases, share a common wall. A small 
trench runs along the side of the road, carrying water, dirt, and 
other waste away from the houses. On either side of the road, 
small plants rest in narrow potted beds along the side of the 
road, adding both color and beauty to the area. 
   A massive gate engraved with black prancing stallion stands at 
the southern side of road, set into a tall brick wall that 
borders a large home.

Western End of the Garden Square~
   Colorful foliage and palm trees separate the square from the 
bustle of the city. Marble benches sit neatly beneath the palms. 
White, baked bricks are laid out in a large star shape in the 
center of the square. A beautifully rendered marble statue rests 
upon the star. To the east, the musical tinkling sound of 
fountains drifts into the quiet square, and the west leads to a 
brick pathway back to the road and bustling city beyond.

Eastern End of the Garden Square~

cocoon of greenery. A long, rectangular marble pool dominates 
this quiet end of the square while a fountain of flowing water 
heads the shimmering rectangular pool. The flowing water tinkles 
its gentle melody, drowning out the distant sounds of the city. 
Baked, white bricks form a intricate woven pathway, large enough 
for two big men to pass shoulder to shoulder around the pool. 
   To the west, the tiny square continues. To the east a small 
white, brick path leads back into the housing area.

#6The "Drifting Lily" Inn#8~
   Graceful lines comprise the interior of this crowded tavern, 
under the arched dome of the ceiling. The walls curve to form a 
rounded rectangle, coated with uneven plaster to give the surface 
a rippling surface, the lower half painted in a wine red color. 
For an extra splash of color, a chain of painted, blue water 
lilies trail unpredictably around the top of the wall, broken 
only by the green of lily pads. Arched windows open into the 
souk, curtained by ivory gauze shades. The floor is tiled with 
mahogany-colored ceramic tiles in a diamond pattern, broken only 
by the occasional, seemingly random ivory tile. Filled with 
people at all hours, musicians often make their stop here to play 
for the crowd. 
   A colorfully beaded curtain lies to the south, returning to 
the souk, while several other arched doorways lead into the other 
parts of the inn.

   While nothing more than a closet, it is spacious as closets go 
by typical standards. The white stone walls form an oblong room 
with slightly uneven angles from corner to corner. Grey stone 
tiles the floor with little regard for perfection, unlike the 
rest of the manor. Regardless, it is still a sturdy and 
functional room.

   The heavy scent of fermentation and alcohol hangs thick here, 
despite the arched, open windows set along the western walls. 
The straight brick walls have been textured with a plaster 
applied with light vertical grain and painted a deep, swirling 
brown in an attempt to resemble wood panelling. The 
ivory-colored ceiling bears a dark, bronze oil lap, flickering 
its light dully throughout the shop. Shelves and large barrel 
racks line two of the walls to hold the shop's wares. 
   The door leading back into the souk to the west has been 
painted black, while another door set in the eastern wall heads 
into the shop's back rooms.

   This workroom seems to lack space between the various storage 
racks, brewing fires, and workbench. Nonetheless, everything is 
placed in an efficient manner. The walls remain a plain white in 
appearance, the brick used to create structure left untouched. 
The floor however has been paved in green hexagonal tiles. The 
ceramic surface is slightly glossy, cracked in a few places where 
something must have dropped. A few small windows sit within the 
northern and eastern sides of the building, offering some 
ventilation to the heat generated by the fires. 
   A wooden door sits in the floor in the northeast corner, 
leading down into a cellar. The door to the west returns to the

together perfectly so that mortar was unnecessary. The floor is 
made of cool, packed earth and clay. A variety of racks and

noop * This room program set is painfully long, and for that I am sorry, but error
noop * states are important to me. :) The basic outline of this room program is below.
noop * I've broken it up into a bunch of room programs so as to make things more legible.
noop * 
noop * For each room, 1 to 11:
noop * if haso contract (this calls one of 11 other programs)
noop *    if timer is OCCUPIED
noop *       give key
noop *       also, if marker in rent room
noop *          refresh contract if they have paid for more rent (to avoid contracts decaying)
noop *    if timer is EXPIRED
noop *       give chance to renew ("request renewal" handles the renewal process)
noop *    if timer is VACANT
noop *       This is a very rare case, as the vacant marker lasts at most an IC hour.
noop *       If a player has an unexpired contract and this state is true, their contract
noop *       DID NOT DECAY PROPERLY and this state takes it off their hands.
noop *    if there is no timer at all - contract has just sold
noop *       say "Office has not finished paperwork on your room yet, please come back in an hour."
noop * final else (does not have contract)
noop *    say need to have your contract out to get your key
noop * (also checks if you're holding an expired contract, obj 80081, tells you it's expired)

A Musty Hallway~
   A fairly narrow hallway, there is barely enough room for two 
people to walk side by side. The walls are formed of coarse clay 
bricks, recently whitewashed, judging by the cleanliness of the 
color. Faded tile paves the floor, probably a bright red color 
which has now become an uneven mix of pinks and browns. A 
slightly damp, musty scent fills the hallway, making the air feel 
heavy and thick. A pair of tarnished sconces hang from either 
side of the western arch, holding oil lamps to provide light. 
   The open arch leads out into the lobby, while a door carved 
with a small figure of a lion sits along the eastern wall. A 
staircase can be seen just to the south, and the hallway 
stretches farther to the north.

A Musty Hallway and Staircase~
   Set on the ground floor, the narrow hallway ends at an even 
narrower staircase that zigzags its way up to the second level. 
Formed of coarse clay bricks, the walls hold a clean white color, 
as though having been recently whitewashed. The stairs appear to 
have been whitewashed too, but worn scuff marks along the centers 
have begun to show dirty and yellowing. A slightly damp, musty 
scent fills the hallway, making the air feel heavy and thick. 
Two oil lamps set in the staircase offers little in the way of 
light, making the footing precarious.

single oil lamp that hangs from the vaulted ceiling. The walls 
are solidly formed of white stone, kept looking clean. Where the 
worn steps end, the scuffed whitewash curves into pale green 
ceramic tiles that continues through the landing and down the 
hall to the north.

from the vaulted ceiling, casting only a dim light into the area. 
The floor, however, is clean swept and tiled with glossy, pale 
green ceramic tiles that helps in part to reflect the dim light. 
An attempt to add decor and style takes the form of yellow arches 
made of ceramic tiles around the door frames. 
   The white door to the east bears a profile of a frog, while 
the white door to the west has been carved with the likeness of a

A Small Apartment~
   A thick layer of ivory tinted plaster coats both the ceiling 
and the wall, covering the brick beneath as evident by a chipped, 
exposed corner in the northwest of the room. Despite the mildly 
run-down state of the plaster and the cracked, blue ceramic 
flooring, the apartment appears fairly clean. A faded red 
curtain divides the room, offering minimal privacy for the 
sleeping section on the southern side. And a large window opens 
to the west, offering a view of the street. 
   A blue-painted door leads out into the hallway to the east, a 
small, black hawk painted in the center.

A Single-Room Apartment~
   Large enough for kitchen and sleeping areas with additional 
space for entertaining, this apartment is divided only by reed 
shades that hang from the yellow-painted ceiling. The floor is 
spanned by marbled, orange and white ceramic tiles, the swirled 
squares cracked in a few places. The brick walls have been 
heavily plastered with ivory-colored mud, some spots cleaner than 
others, suggesting fresh patches over cracked or broken places. 
A pair of reed-shaded windows rests along the eastern wall, 
offering a stunning view of the plain building next door. 
   The door to the west leads out into the hallway, painted pale 
yellow with a red fig in the middle.

A Blue-Painted Room~
   Unevenly covered in a layer of thick plaster, the walls have 
been painted a delicate shade of azure blue, plentiful cracks 
visible behind the paint as fine dips in the upper coat. The 
floor is tiled in ivory ceramic, stained brown in various places 
near the kitchen area of the room. The ceiling is bare and 
undecorated, revealing the white brick and thick, wooden 
supporting beams. A black curtain made of large cylindrical 
beads separates the sleeping area as an attempt for privacy. A 
similar curtain shades the window along the western wall that 
opens to a view of the street. 
   The door leading to the hallway to the east is tinted a darker 
shade of blue, decorated by an image of a black scarab beetle.

A Curtain-Divided Apartment~
   Shards of ceramic tiles cover the floor of this decently sized 
apartment in a colorful array, almost resembling a chaotic 
mosaic. The walls on the western half of the room are covered by 
textured plaster, painted sea green and hiding any sign of the 
brick beneath. A dark blue curtain hangs from the whitewashed 
ceiling, diving the kitchen and entertaining half of the room 
from the sleeping area. The walls on the other side bear a light 
coat of blue over the stone bricks. A long window sits along the 
eastern wall, shuttered from the neighboring building. 
   Leading out into the hall, the door along the western wall is 
painted white, etched with a green-painted fish.

A Cramped Apartment~
   With little enough room to offer a full semblance of a house, 
this apartment makes the most of its space by cramming a kitchen, 
a dining area, and sleeping quarters all in one room, separated 
by a reed curtain attached to the ivory-tiled ceiling. Flawless, 
green ceramic tile covers the clean floor, as though recently 
laid. The brick walls have a thin layer of ivory plaster. 
Although without visible cracks, the pattern of the bricks 
beneath can still be seen. A large window along the eastern wall 
could serve as a back door, if not for the close proximity of the 
next building. 
   The whitewashed door set in the western wall leads to the 
hallway, a brown lion painted in the center.

A Red-Paved Room~
   Bright red ceramic tiles pave the entire floor of this 
fair-sized room, the surface exceptionally glossy and reflective. 
The walls and ceiling have been coated with a thick coat of 
uneven white plaster, but due to the nature of the floor, they 
seem to have a faint pink tone. A pale green curtain hangs from 
the ceiling, dividing the sleeping area from the rest of the room 
that serves as a kitchen and a dining area in one. 
   An open arch leads out into a balcony to the west, offering a 
view of the street below. Set with a painting of a pale green 
snake, the white door along the eastern wall leads to the 
hallway.

A Canopied Balcony~
   Jutting out a short distance from the building, this balcony 
is enough for two or three people to stand side by side, but 
little else. It is formed of solid support beams and white 
brick, tiled with faded blue ceramic tiles and framed in a simple 
wrought-iron railing. Attached to a pair of iron poles, a stiff 
canvas canopy, left its natural off-white color, offers a small 
degree of protection from the elements overhead. 
   An uncovered arch returns to the small apartment to the east.

An Oddly-Angled Room~
   Lacking the clean, straight lines of a normal room, the 
southern wall and ceiling collide at an uneven angle, almost as 
though someone had tried to curve the ceiling, giving up part of 
the way through. The walls and ceiling are brushed with a 
swirling texture of yellow, the floor paved with large, plum 
tiles that bear cracks in only a few places. A functioning 
kitchen is set beside a small dining area with a small portion of 
room to spare. 
   A green frog crouches upon the ivory western door that leads 
out into the hallway, while another door, painted entirely purple 
sits opposite.

A Small, Yellow-Tiled Room~
   Bright yellow tiles cover this room from the floor and up to 
half the walls, giving an almost golden appearance as the highly 
glossy surface reflects the light onto the ivory-colored walls. 
The ceiling bears similar tiling, although the shade is much 
paler by comparison and appears to be precariously set as many of 
the tiles appear to be missing, revealing the white brick 
beneath. A rounded alcove along the northern wall would fit the 
headboard of a two-person bed, with an easy view of the small 
window set in the eastern wall. 
   A purple-painted door returns to the main room of the 
apartment to the west.

Heavy iron sconces throw oily flicking light across the stark 
cold stone walls. Thick rushes seem to rustle and move. Three 
bleak iron doors sit in the walls to the north, west and south. 
A battered desk rests in the middle of the room. A carved, stone 
staircase, narrow and rough leads up. Slots in each door allow 
one to slide them open and gaze at who is in the cells.

A Musty Cell~
   This small mouldy room seems cramped and secluded. Dull 
flickering flames play over the dark walls at all times where 
three decently sized cages line the far wall. A number of 
shackles have also been attached to the mould and slime covered 
walls with a small gutter running through the dungeon often 
overflowing to fill the bottom of the cages. A putrid smell is 
heavy in the musty air of this awful place. 
   The floor is scratched with the words call food and call 
clothes.

A Circular Common Room~
   The bare walls of this round room are made from the white 
adobe common to the area. To the north, the wall simply opens 
into a long hall, the adobe walls continue there, cool and 
comfortable beneath the harsh southern sky. To the south, a set 
of double-doors with sturdy handles stands, a large, 
silver-painted moon having been engraved onto each, leads out 
into an outdoor courtyard. An opening in the western wall leads 
to the kitchen. The room is cool and comfortable.

Kitchen~
   Stepping into this room instantly greets one with the smells 
of various foods, regardless of the time. During its busy hours 
this kitchen is filled with steamy aromas and is bustling with 
the sounds of cooking and shouting. A stone oven covers the 
eastern wall, often containing the smells of baked goods unless 
it has undergone a recent cleaning. Cool stone, makes up the 
flooring and the white, adobe walls of this room keep it cool 
from the heat of the day. The tiled roof has a closable wooden 
vent to be used if too much smoke or steam gathers in the area.

the room. Pots, pans, dishes, and bowls line the shelving and

   This long room stands upon a scrubbed stone floor, and its 
rectangular walls made of cool, white adobe.Upon either wall, are 
murals of a silver moon and golden striking corbra. Set upon the 
walls at regular intervals are iron pegs with a ring at the end, 
a brass lantern hanging on each. A lightly beaded curtain hangs 
over an entry to the east. To the north, the hall ends abruptly 
at a tall, wood-framed door, while to the south, it opens up into 
an expansive common room. A narrow staircase made from stucco 
bricks leads upwards to a arched wooden door.

An interesting patterned white brick path leads from the gate 
to the marble building at the end of the brickwork. On either 
side of the path manicured lawns stretch to the adobe walls of 
the compound. Neatly landscaped trees dot the tender green of 
the lawns while borders of brightly colored, sweet smelling 
flowers line either side of the brick path. A wide, elegant 
double door bearing the Crest of Gondor is set into a large, 
white adobe building, its clay tiled roof offering protection 
from the harsh southern sky. 
   A crushed white stone path leads east into the garden.

Reception Room~
   Tall colonnades rise up here, their marble surfaces reflecting 
the light of candles encased in glass of various colors. Their 
careful placement casts a subtle hue over the room, low walls of 
the same white marble as the colonades lounging the east and west 
sides of the room with arches frequently bisecting the low line 
and stone benches seeming to flow from the marble. These are 
decorated with intricate mosaics, blossoms of color adding to the 
decor in a tasteful yet subtle manner. In the middle of this 
marble-paved room lies a low fountain, its three tiers rising to 
meet the high ceiling above and clear, pure water trickling its 
way down to a pool fashioned in the shape of the Tree of Gondor. 
Doorways lead out in all directions and a grand staircase winds 
its way up to a second floor.

A Blue-Tinted Stone Hallway~
   Marble from the western reception room gives way to 
blue-tinted stone, the light color accented by the intricate 
geometric patterns paving the ground in the form of stone 
mosaics. Casting light upon these floor mosaics of a generally 
bluish purple color are diamond- shaped lanterns, their colored 
glass assuming the same tints one would expect to see in an 
ocean. Tapestries, matching the general style of the hallway, 
occasionally break up the coloring.

Along a Mosaic-Floored Hallway~
   Continuing from the west and progressing further east, the 
blue stone walls begin to take on small speckles of a blueish 
teal. This change is reflected by the gradual fading of reds and 
purples from the mosaics paving the floor, to be replaced by 
scenes of the sea and shades of green and blue. Diamond-shaped 
lanterns, their tinted panes transforming to a soft sea green as 
one progresses further eastwards, illuminate tapestries which 
sometimes run from ceiling to floor. An arch, the rounded curve 
itself a mosaic of the White Tree intertwined among other crests 
of Gondor, holds a rosewood door. A simple black metal ring set 
in its center allows it to be opened, and a small lock of black 
metal is set in the side of the doorway.

A Dusky, Extended Library~
   From a mosaiced arch, bearing a rosewood door, set in the 
southern wall this library expands forward majestically. The 
floor is a warm, almost rose-colored wood which emanates a very 
soft, very subtle odor of pleasant wood. Rugs of a reddish hue 
continue across the floor as it stretches onwards to the north. 
Lounging the walls and filling the space, massive bookshelves 
bearing hundreds of books drop from the ceiling, caressing the 
wall, and plant their heavy load upon the ground. Red-tinted 
lanterns have been set up among the pillars, painted an ochre 
color, to provide lighting to the room and to the various plush 
chairs, divans and desks placed carefully about the library.

Across a Staircased Library~
   Faint reddish hues penetrate the light orange color of the 
wood which makes up the flooring here. Its glossy surface is 
dotted by beautifully crafted rugs of a generally reddish hue 
though as one moves further northwards they adopt a brighter, 
more yellow tint. Massive bookshelves, their ink-hearted 
contents illuminated by the red-paned lanterns dotted around the 
room, cast their weight from wooden ceiling to floors. Parallel 
to these are pillars which support the entire area, painted an 
ochre color in a manner which seems to blend with the stone and 
the surroundings. As one arrives in the northern end of the 
library, four small stairs, ivy-carved, lead up to a wooden 
platform covered by a massive yellow rug and pillows. Directly 
to the east of this an arch made of glass with a simple black 
knob allows access to a garden.

A Small Corner Garden~
   Snuggled into a corner, this small garden nonetheless is rich 
in verdant plantlife. A small brick set of steps leads from a 
glass doorway to the west into lush, carefully maintained grass 
bisected by a trail. Large, smooth stones line the trail, 
guardians of the abundance of flowers, trees and plants which 
inhabit this corner. The walls are all but invisible, covered by 
an ivy-like plant whose flowers emanate a soft, almost 
citrus-like odor. A bench has been placed beside a two-tiered 
pond, two large trees providing shade.

At The End of a Blue-Stoned Hallway~
Blue stone, streaked with green, creates symmetrical walls which rise
up from green mosaics paving the floor. The geometric patterns reflect
against the light green ceiling which slowly fades to blue as one
moves westwards up the hallway. A large mosaic of the Tree of Gondor
on a landscape of blue heralds the end of the hallway, three arches
set in the walls confirming it. Cedarwood, its light overtones darkened
and carved upon, fits perfectly in the arches, braced by a set of sturdy
hinges and an ornately worked black metal ring in the center of each
door. Scrollwork has been done on the stone of the arches, the carving of
a masterful quality. Hanging above and providing an abundance of light
is a large, square lantern whose glass bottom allows easy lighting
while dots and holes in the metalwork of the sides casts a myriad of
star-like shadows on the ceiling and upper walls.

A Green-Walled, Large Room~
   Walls of a solid, smooth and cool stone have been painted 
shades of green in this room. Curling lazily around the walls, 
the painter has also added what seems to be caravans, painted in 
black with precise and minute detail, traversing across 
landscapes beginning in the lighter green, texture added to make 
it grainy to the touch, to a deeper, almost forest green at the 
north side of the room, thin emboldened lines raised in a network 
of almost leaf-like texture. The floor is a soft light wood, the 
White Tree emblazoned in the surface. A cedarwood door leads 
southwards, encased by a frame covered in scrollwork.

A Blue-Walled, Large Room~
   Dark blue where they meet the light wooden floor, the walls 
become gradually lighter shades of blue until they reach the 
ceiling. Its sky blue shade is accented by streaks of white 
which give it the appearance of a sky filled by clouds of all 
shapes and sizes. Cruising their way along the walls from the 
cedarwood door to the west, ships of a clear white color, their 
majestic forms exquisitely rendered and nearly lifelike, are 
painted upon the walls. Foamy waves buffet the ships, where tall 
Men, their skins of radiant white contrasting with their black 
hair, stand or sail. In the darker depths below, nameless shapes 
cruise unnoticed below while above giant birds soar the lighter 
hues.

A Violet-Walled, Large Room~
   Violet walls run the length of this large room, holding up the 
ceiling above with relative ease. The ceiling itself is an 
almost reddish hue, and a grand representation of Anor, the Sun, 
radiates from its center. The floor is a wooden one, its color 
almost sand-like as it reflects the color from above. Giving 
depth to the walls, dunes are painted on the violet walls, 
becoming darker as they reach further away to give a sense that 
if one were to touch them one could step into the wall. A 
cedarwood door, carved with intricate geometric symbols, allows 
egress and access. This entry is encased by an arch which lends 
it a rounded shape, scrollwork running the length of the curve.

A Stone-Paved Terrace~
   This terrace shoots forth from the large glass-paned doors set 
in the southern wall, smooth surfaced stone providing easy 
footing across the wide expanse of this terrace. Sprouting from 
the walls and running along the edges, two rails made of metal 
carefully worked to resemble twisting vines carry one onwards to 
five stone stairs leading into a vast garden. From here, the 
entirety of the garden can be seen, some corners and alcoves 
protected by tall, leafy trees and full shrubs. A wide trail 
continues from the stairs briefly before reaching an 
intersection.

At an Intersection of Trails~
   Turning away from the main trail leading onto the southern 
terrace, smaller trails push their way east, west and north under 
the shade of tall trees. Flowers sprout from the grass along the 
trails, exuding a gentle aroma which blends with that of the 
other plantlife. In the middle of this intersection a statue 
rises up, its granite face nearly lifelike.

White Tree, while the other extends out almost welcomingly, 
fingers pointing towards the west.

Along a Trail~
   Stones dot the side of the trail, peeking their moss-covered 
bodies out of the plants of the garden. Flowers and small plants 
line the trail, giving way to taller plantlife and trees as they 
move away from the trail. The sky above is easily visible, 
however thick plantlife blocks sight to the north and south. The 
trail of hard-packed yellowish dirt continues to the west and 
meets an intersection to the east.

Curving Past an Alcove~
   The trail begins a gentle bend here, its hard-packed dirt 
lined with small flowers and shrubs. As the trail progresses 
further north and east, the surrounding areas are filled with all 
manner of plantlife. These follow a gradient-like order, with 
flowers and smaller plants giving way to taller shrubs and trees. 
As one rounds the corner a small alcove seems to have been 
naturally formed, a bench concealed and overshadowed by a series 
of tall trees, flowers and plants. The sound of birds claiming 
their perches among the verdant greenery is the only noise 
breaking the silence.

decorative, colorful, flowering vines climb up the high wall. A 
brook can be heard tinkeling musically in the distance. Brightly 
colored birds swoop between the boughs their song and call 
echoing across the grounds.

   Seeming to stretch forward from the arch leading into the 
reception area, walls made of a rough-textured stone stretch on 
in an almost linear fashion. The only break is a stairwell, 
seemingly carved out of the wall, whose narrow metal steps lead 
upwards and out of sight. The grainy texture of the wall 
contrasts with the smooth flooring, kept spotlessly clean. A 
door is set in the southern wall, fashioned of ordinary-looking 
wood with an iron ring in its center. Small studs follow the 
curve of the door, and square, red-hued lanterns provide abundant 
lighting.

clear white in color, and the room seems to be naturally cool. 
On the floor is a modest rug colored white with patterns of light

Passing by a Large Archway~
   The red-hued walls continue to the east and west, their solid 
color matched by the white of the smooth stone floor. The grainy 
walls curve their way around a large arch set in the northern 
wall, the sounds and smells of a kitchen coming through the bead 
curtain. The archway itself is dotted with small tiles bearing 
scenes one would associate with cookery and food. A low bench 
seems shaped out of the same stone which forms the wall, placed 
parallel to the arch and illuminated by the same square lanterns 
whose red-tinted light spreads abundantly along the hallway.

A Massive Kitchen~
   Expanding outwards in massive scale from the southern arch, 
this kitchen is truly of grand proportions. Several fireplaces 
line the northern walls, of varying sizes and with various 
implements of the roasting and cooking arts. Near one of these, 
a small bath-like dip in the multi-colored stone tiled floors is 
usually filled with coals, and an elaborate metal spit rises 
above it. On the east side of the kitchen a long countertop runs 
its way from corner to corner, dotted with cabinets, shelves and 
rectangular basins. Tables of all shapes and sizes are 
interspersed between pillars colored by stone tiles. Two 
doorways, one set between two fireplaces and one in the 
north-eastern corner, offer the only alternatives to the southern 
arch.

containers. Shelves and cabinets line the walls, their

crossbeams have been laid lengthwise across the entire eastern 
wall and a variety of barrels and casks are laid atop them, the 
bigger ones sitting below while the smaller nestle against the 
smooth grey ceiling. On the northern wall, an entire wall is 
honeycombed by wooden hatchwork, the sturdy material reinforced 
by metal and inhabited by hundreds of bottles. The remaining 
sides hold only pallets, full to a varying degree, and a tall 
wooden ladder on wheels is set at the northern and eastern walls.

candelabra which hang from the ceiling on sturdy metal chains. 
Long tables are set in the center of the room, and a few smaller 
tables are arranged in the corners of the room. A giant 
fireplace, complete with brick hearth, brings further warmth to

mosaic here, its red background covered in its center by the 
White Tree of Gondor and flanked on the southern side by a 
crescent moon in smooth white. On the western side, grey 
mountains curve their way around to white forests on the northern 
side, a single tall mountain piercing their depths. Two doors 
have been set in the southern and western walls, their arches 
curving along the wall and the plain wood shaped to mimic this.

Tall windows, their blue-tinted glass panes allowing light to

up of equally white stone, and two beds are spaced a good 
distance apart. A metal lantern hangs down from the ceiling, 
perforated by hundreds of tiny diamonds, triangles and holes 
which give off star-like pinpoints when the candles are lit. A

balustrade lining the spaces between tall white colonnades which 
rise up from below. Hanging black metal lanterns drop a few 
inches from the ceiling, their artistically rendered sides and 
panes producing soft lighting. Leading below, a grand stairwell

A Large, Dusty Caravan Yard~
   Sidled up against the looming, stone wall, this expansive yard 
is host to traveling caravans, merchants, and wayfarers who come 
to visit the city. Hard-packed dirt, cleared free of most rocks 
and rubble, provide the foundation for the number of tents and 
wagons placed here by the various visitors who have opted not to 
rent rooms in the taverns or rent housing. A common cooking pit 
has been centered around the yard, although several travelers 
have opted for their own campfires. 
   The bustle of the main road and the gate lies just to the 
west, while a building that emanates with the scent of hay and 
manure has been set up against the wall to the north.

The Desert Flower~
   Intoxicating aromas waft through the air of this cool, 
white-washed adobe building. A wide window looks out to the 
south, its panes covered with wispy white silk curtains. Secured 
from the white tiled ceiling, shiny brass and crystal lanterns 
swing gently, throwing bright scattered light across the room. 
The floor is tiled in indigo and polished to a lusterous shine. 
Behind the counter are lines of shelves displaying a wide variety 
of bottles, jars and boxes of soaps.

A Comfortable Office~
   Thick, cool white-washed adobe form the unadorned walls of 
this spartan room. A wide window looks out to the south, its 
panes covered with wispy white silk curtains. Shiny brass 
lanterns swing from a thick support beam. The floor is highly 
polished ceramic tile the color of indigo. The scent of almonds 
and oranges mingles with the fresh smell of the river wafting in 
from the southern door.

An Intimate Dining Room~
   The white stone walls are trimmed in warm mahogany. The floor 
is polished marble. Various pictures hang in stately frames 
about the wall - mostly depicting either Haradaic men, or 
Snake-related pieces of artwork. Behind the head of the table, a 
bust of a bronze cobra head with ivory fangs bared, with fiery 
eyes of gemstone sits on a mahogany pedestal. A reed door is set 
in the northern wall. A large white stone fireplace on the south 
wall.

   The ruins of a large, burnt out mansion rise imposingly before 
you. The once lavish facade now a blackened and ruined shell. 
Debris litters the area, broken timbers and lumps of masonry 
falling away from the dilapidated ruin.

Reception Hall~
   The floor is a tiled mosaic, forming an enormously complex, 
self-repeating pattern that extends all the way to the walls of 
the room. The tiles themselves are made of tiny blocks of 
masterfully worked marble, their natural colours being 
incorporated into the design, adding to the captivating patterns. 
The spacious room is nearly two stories tall, the walls made of 
white stone with red cedar supports and joins. The roof of the 
room is a hemispherical dome of lead glass, capturing and 
reflecting the light in such a way that the light in the room is 
always shifting. A wide gracefully arched doorway leads north.

An Expansive Parlor~
   This expansive room is twice as wide as it is deep. The floor 
is made of tiles of polished marble, keeping to the natural 
colors and patterns of the marble itself. The ground has been 
overlaid with richly hued silk carpets and rugs in places, a 
feature also found on the walls - thicker, more elaborate carpets 
adorn the walls, hanging from iron rods with spherical ends. The 
cedar wood supports on the walls have been carved into detailed 
mathematical patterns. A white stone staircase lines the 
opposite wall, gently working its way upward. Suspended from the 
central support in the room, a large chandelier glows with gentle 
candlelight. A door to the north leads into a hall of some kind, 
and to the east, curtained doorways lead out onto a terrace.

Servants Quarters~
   Clearly a place for the servants to live and eat, this hall 
has several simple bunks arranged in neat rows. The walls, made 
of granite, are completely unadorned but for a few plain iron 
lanterns to provide light. There are also numerous windows, and 
the door on the western wall. The sandstone floor is obviously 
frequently swept, but has a number of stains and mars. A table 
and eating area is in one corner of the room.

   This white stone kitchen is unadorned and utilitarian, but 
fairly well appointed. There is plenty of space for working 
with, and the facilities are clean and well-maintained. There 
are several windows, with shutters - the sills of which are 
slightly stained from the various foods that have cooled upon 
them. There are numerous cupboards, a large oven, a stove, and 
all the ordinary things one would expect to find in an estate's 
kitchen.

   A sturdy set of pine, stairs slants its way to and from the

many shelves benches, and cabinets dusted. The cool stone walls 
are carefully and neatly whitewashed. The air is dry and cool 
and the soft scent of beeswax mingles with the aroma of drying 
herbs, and spices.

   This covered terrace - broad in dimensions and large enough to 
entertain a small party - is made from indigo ceramic tiles. The 
clay tiled roof overhead is shallowly sloped, and covers the 
entirety of the deck area, keeping the weather largely out. A

An Expansive Garden~
   Two large willow trees nestle the riverbank, dipping their 
long fronds into the slow moving river, their boughs casting a 
refreshing shade all around them. A small cobbled path bordered 
by colorful flowers, leads around a small fountain. Sandalwood 
trees border the grounds; their scent heady in the air. A small, 
sturdy dock rests next to a short, narrow strand of pale, yellow 
sand. Stone stairs lead up to the terrace. A small white stone 
building sits to the east end of the grounds.

A Broad Hallway~
   Approximately as wide as three men abreast, this hall is lined 
with portraits of Haradaic faces; all Male, all Haradaic. The 
perceptive observer would note that the portraits on the right 
are all older men, whereas the portraits on the left are all 
younger men. An even more perceptive observer would note that 
the portraits on the left and the right directly opposite one 
another are of the same men, at different ages. The hall is lit 
by demure brace sconces, spaced evenly along the length of the 
hall. The floor has been covered with a single long carpet of 
silk. There are rooms to the south and west, and the hall 
continues to the north. 
   A wide and curving red, cedar staircase leads upwards.

A Broad Hallway~
   This hallway continues from its beginnings, making a sharp 
bend towards the north. The southern end of the hall has several 
portraits, but they come to an end - empty spaces obviously 
intended to hold the portraits of future masters of the 
household. A similar carpet of silk has been laid along the 
length of the hall, though not adjoining the other directly. The 
door at the northern end of the hall is tall and broad, with 
posters of wood carved into the image of cobras entwining 
themselves around a pillar. There are doors to the east and west 
also.

   Silks and carpets of richly dyed colors - greens and blues - 
have been draped over the white stone walls. Fine rugs cover 
cool indigo tiled floor. One entire corner is taken up by a silk 
screen, surrounded by cedar frames. Delicate glass lanterns 
swing gently from the tiled ceiling throwing soft light across 
the room. Blue and green tasseled pillows are placed around a 
low mahogany table. A large bed veiled in white silk dominates 
the room. Wispy silk curtains of blue and green drape the 
eastern doorway.

air mingling with the fresh scent of the Sheshem Mew as it lazily

A Tiled Bath~
   Four walls and a floor of cool white tiles mark this room as a 
bathroom. Random wall tiles have been hand painted with an 
intricate border pattern of slithering snakes, each one 
reproduced exactly as each of the others to the eye. The ceiling 
is made of tiny ceramic tiles of vibrant blues and greens, 
arranged in a complex fractal swirl. A small dumb-waiter near 
the large sunken tub allows heated water to be bucketed up here 
from downstairs. The blue and green tiled tub is wide enough for 
two and sits one marble step up and a shallow half-step above the 
floor.

   This bedroom, whilst clearly not the master bedroom of the 
house, is nonetheless quite luxuriously appointed. It is by no 
means small, and there is a long window on the southern wall that 
provides a splendid view of the riverside garden. The walls are 
likely white stone, draped with colorful silks and rugs. One 
fine tapestry depicts, a rabbit loping across a manicured lawn.

The other walls are adorned with weapons and armour of various

Hanging above an impressively large stone fireplace, one of the

The Rental Office~
   Sparsely decorated and with nary a window, this room is drab 
and uninviting and appears more the product of having just been 
sectioned off from the middle of the rest of the building. The 
walls and ceiling have been plastered with an uneven coat of 
ivory, and the floors are tiled with grey ceramic, plain and 
almost perfectly square. A few sconces hang from the walls to 
hold oil lamps that provide the light to the office. 
   A door along the north seems to be locked up tight, while 
south returns to the more inviting lobby.

noop * This room program allows a player whose contract has expired to request
noop * a renewal of their room. A contract is marked as expired when the timer
noop * in room 80231 has turned from OCCUPIED to EXPIRED. This room program
noop * takes the old contract from them and reloads a new one for purchase in
noop * 80233. It also clears the expired timer from 80231.
noop * NOTE: In order to request a renewal, the key for the room must have been
noop * turned in already OR be held by the requester (along with their contract)
noop *
noop * For simplicity's sake, this room program has been broken up into 11 smaller
noop * room programs, to be called depending on a case.

The Peacock's Plumage~
   The gradually domed ceiling of this shop comes to a peak in 
the center, tiled with deep blue ceramic tiles and pierced with 
starburst shapes that have been filled in with different colored 
pieces of glass that cast spots of cheerful color. The plain 
white brick walls have been masked with azure fabric panels, and 
the floor is paved with ceramic ivory tiles, the varying shades 
of off-white swirling decoratively. Two large windows sit along 
the western wall, flanking the doorway, curtained with airy, pale 
yellow silk. Another window along the southern side better 
resembles double doors based on its size, looking out to the 
river. Each window bears an elegantly scrolling grate, the 
blackened iron forming artistic renditions of stars and moons 
within the midst of whirling scrolls. Sunlight liberally pours 
into the shop, rendering the pair of hanging oil lamps useless. 
Display cases hold the shop's wares, most of them hanging. 
   A corner of the shop has been curtained off with velvet for 
use as a changing room, and a rounded arch door has been fitted 
flush with the northern wall. Leading back to the busy souk, the 
doorway to the west holds a curtain of clear, crystalline glass 
beads.

   The gradually domed ceiling of this shop comes to a peak in 
the center, tiled with deep blue ceramic tiles and pierced with 
starburst shapes that have been filled in with different colored 
pieces of glass. The plain white brick walls have been masked 
with azure fabric panels, and the floor is paved with ceramic 
ivory tiles, the varying shades of off-white swirling 
decoratively. Two large windows sit along the western wall, 
flanking the doorway, curtained with airy, pale yellow silk. 
Another window along the southern side better resembles double 
doors based on its size. Shuttered with glass, each window bears 
an elegantly scrolling grate, the blackened iron forming artistic 
renditions stars and moons within the midst of whirling scrolls. 
A pair of hanging oil lamps burn brightly, filling the room with 
their light. Display cases hold the shop's wares, most of them 
hanging. 
   A corner of the shop has been curtained off with velvet for 
use as a changing room, and a rounded arch door has been fitted 
flush with the northern wall. Leading back to the busy souk, the 
doorway to the west holds a curtain of clear, crystalline glass 
beads.

A Well-Organized Workroom~
   Setting a brave contrast compared to the store's front room, 
this room is plain, although spacious. The walls and ceiling 
retain their bare white stone, the angles straight and clean. 
The floor is set with white stone, kept meticulously clean over 
the time since it was paved, judging from the lack of stains or 
ground-in dust. The workspace is plentiful, allowing room for 
large swaths of cloth to be worked on, along with ample lighting 
that comes in from an array of small, high-set windows along the 
western and northern walls. 
   The door to the south has been rounded in an arch along the 
top and leads into the shop front, while to the east, a 
beautifully painted door, detailing a fig tree heavy with fruit, 
sits before the stockroom.

A Small, Crowded Stockroom~
   This stockroom is fairly cramped by the different varieties of 
organizational structures, regardless of the amount of stock 
being stored in here. The means for hanging and storing folded 
clothes rest along all the plain, white walls but one. The other 
wall holds storage capable of holding all manners accessories and 
shoes. The floor is clean and tiled with white tiles, and the 
only thing to break the monotony of the white ceiling is the 
sight of a wooden support beam that runs through the middle.

A Small Corner Dressing Room~
   Set in the northeast corner of the tailor shop, this room has 
just enough room to move and change. The only thing dividing it 
from the main room is a brass bar that has been fixed from one 
wall to the other, a dark blue velvet curtain hanging from it 
that just barely misses sweeping along the floor. A few hooks 
have been set in the wall for holding one's possessions, and a 
small ivory oval rug sits on the floor.

cool and dark, its air still and quiet. A single brass lantern 
swings from the overhead support beams. A sturdy mahogany door

Drowning Corsair~
   Tall cedar pilings wrapped with heavy, hemp rope stretching 
between them, are topped with large brass lanterns at the far end 
of the dock. Drying nets are draped over the makeshift rope 
railing. A tiled roof supported by huge beams slants gently 
downward towards the river but stops abruptly at half distance 
along decking. A bar made of upturned barrels with thick, sturdy 
cedar planks atop them sits beneath the half-roof facing the 
water. Brass lanterns swing over the bar throwing uneven light 
across the half room. Tables are placed across the open dock 
with heavy brass lanterns nailed to their center. A ship's bell 
echos across the lapping waters of the Sheshem Mew. Cool winds 
ripple the water beneath the decking as night settles over the 
south. 
   A set of wooden stairs leads up to the second floor, creaking 
at intervals even without the benefit of feet traversing it.

the center of the room. Cabinets and shelves line the walls and 
a small alcove acts as a pantry.

Plainsman Pre-Game Shop and Set Up Area~
   The plains dwellers fit the Gondorian stereotype of the 
Haradrim. Living in a nomadic or semi-nomadic existence away 
from the large cities, and instead survive through a mix-match of 
livestock herding and primitive farming upon the wide scrub 
plains and harsh sands of the Harad. The plains dwellers as a 
people are divided in to countless small tribes assembled upon 
loose family lines, and lead a self-sufficient existence. 
Traditions, customs, and language dialects differ from tribe to 
tribe, but some values are common; the fierce self-independence 
of the tribe against all else, the pride at survival in either 
the barren hinterlands or harsh desert of Harad, the mature 
acceptance of responsibility for one's actions, and the pride in 
their blunt honesty, simple words, and straight dealing. The 
shop contains clothing and other items appropriate for a 
plainsman character. When you are ready type #BENTER GAME#0 to 
be moved to the Haradrim tower at Egthela.

Clothing Shop for Corsair and Harad~

that will be much more expensive to find in the game itself. 
Remember, anything purchased in the newbie-shopping complex are 
things your character had on them before coming to Tur Edendor 
and Mordor. To the south is the general area of the shopping 
complex, where you can go after to buy more common items, and to

A Cozy, Private Bedroom~
   This small room has been segmented from the rest of the 
servants' quarters by a thin brick wall, clean and white. The 
ceiling is a dark brown color, the stained cedar wood left 
otherwise unadorned. The floor varies from the rest of the 
northern portion of the building, the white brick being covered 
with pale green-blue ceramic tile and bordered along the edges 
with white. An elongated window with a pointed arch spreads 
along the southern wall, a solid, decorative shutter used in 
place of curtains.

A Grand, Echoing Foyer~
   The large expanse of this foyer is molded from white stone 
blocks, built for the sheer appearance of grandeur. The ceiling 
rises a good fifteen feet from the ground, forming an arched 
dome. Four large, round columns mark four corners of the 
circular room, draped with black banners bearing the Fahad'Jafari 
insignia. The floor is paved with black marble, laid in an 
intricate patter and polished to a mirror-like shine. Any sound 
made in here creates a grand echo over the curved stone.

An Extensive City Library~
   The ceiling of the library rises higher than those in an 
average room, leaving ample space overhead where brass braziers 
cast their light onto the space below. Built of white stone 
bricks, the room is longer than it is wide. Rows upon rows of 
shelves have been carved directly into the stone along the 
northern and western walls, nearly from floor to ceiling, while 
several ladders lean against the open-faced shelving in order to 
reach the top-most books. Tall and narrow windows, each peaked 
in an arch, line the western wall, fitted with iron lattice and 
shuttered with ornate, white boards in bad weather. 
   A set of narrow gates sit in the southern wall, the doorway 
itself the size of a normal door. And a dark-stained, rosewood 
door sits to the north, carved with elegant scrollwork.

A Quiet Office~
   Far from spacious, this compact office is formed of thick, 
white stone walls, enclosing it from the sounds of the outside. 
Vaulted with new wooden beams, the ceiling is high and an angular 
dome shape, pitted with ivory starbursts, where many even pierce 
through to the outside, protected by glass. Most of the wall 
space is covered in mahogany shelving, most of it enclosed behind 
glass doors. The floor is tiled with a dizzying spiral of 
diamonds, the marble tiles varying in shades of white and rose. 
   A solitary door to the south, carved with elegant scrollwork, 
leads back into the library proper.

made upon its surface up to the lofty ceiling overhead. A large 
golden brazier hangs from above, casting flickering light on the 
ceramic mosaic on the ceiling which shows a faded, stylized scene 
of glorious battle. A plush, blood red carpet leads the way to a 
large desk set before a wide, wood-inlaid staircase, like a 
barrier. 
   A short hallways stretch to the north and south, each 
direction home to a host of doors.

it makes up for in sheer size, covering all four walls of this 
room. A scene of desert sands, the endless plane is broken up by 
the stunning image of a lush oasis, a multitude of colors causing 
the room to appear larger than its actual size. White tiles 
cover the floor, cracked in places and reinforced with an extra 
layer of supportive grout. 
   The door to the west has been painted white and bears the 
image of a palm tree, while an arched doorway to the east seems 
to lead further into the unit.

   Part of the ceiling of this apartment slopes at an angle, 
leaning from east to west. Plaster covers the ceiling in a 
creamy orange texture, while the walls show a pure white layer of 
paint. The floor is tiled in bright yellow ceramic squares, 
every few tile slightly discolored a few shades lighter or darker 
in a completely unpatterned design. A small kitchen area divides 
the northeastern half of the room from a living area. Separated 
behind a tall, reed-screen, a small sleeping area finds privacy. 
   An open arch leads out into a balcony to the west, offering a 
view of the street below. Painted with an orange-red 
pomegranate, the white door along the eastern wall leads to the 
hallway.

little else. It is formed of solid support beams and white 
brick, tiled with faded blue ceramic tiles and framed in a simple 
wrought-iron railing. Attached to a pair of iron poles, a stiff 
canvas canopy, left its natural off-white color, offers a small 
degree of protection from the elements overhead. 
   An uncovered arch returns to the small apartment to the east.

A Skylight-set Apartment~
   The ceiling of this apartment has been carefully tiled with 
yellow and green ceramic diamonds, varying in their shades and 
most of them seemingly flawed in one manner or another. 
Carefully fitted into the ceiling are three angled glass windows, 
set in such a way to keep the danger of rain out. The walls are 
simple white plaster, uneven and cracked in places, especially 
near the kitchen area. The floor is paved with red-brown ceramic 
tile, textured in what seems to be an attempt at resembling wood. 
   A narrow arch to the north leads out to a small ledge serving 
as a balcony, while a white birch door opens east, farther into 
the apartment. The door set along the western wall has been 
stained with a dark tint and holds the likeness of a blue reed 
boat.

A Small, Angular Bedroom~
   Oddly angled throughout the entirety of the room, even the 
ceiling seems askew. Then northern side is comprised of three 
walls, each equal in size but forming irregular points as though 
someone tried to create a corner alcove while blindfolded. 
Vibrant blue ceramic tiles pave the floor and part way up the 
wall. The rest of the wall, all the way up to the strangely 
tilted ceiling, is coated liberally with waving texture of ivory 
plaster. A sizable window along the eastern wall is covered with 
a slitted shutter, which allows light and air in, but limits 
visibility. 
   The white birch door set into the western door leads back into 
the main room of the apartment.

A Small, Multilevel Apartment~
   Hazy grey ceramic tiles pave the floor up to a short step-up 
along the western side of the room. A cream-colored screen 
stretches over the higher half, shielding the sleeping area in 
relative privacy. The floor on that side is covered with pale, 
multicolored tiles. The walls have been plastered with a drab 
shade of lavender, the color uneven in several places. The main 
part of the room shares its small space between the kitchen and 
living areas, leaving the apartment complete, if not cramped. 
   An arched doorway opens up into a balcony to the west, only a 
small, black cloth screen offering any sort of cover from the 
weather that might poor in. Leading to the hallway, the door set 
into the eastern wall has been painted dark purple and bears an 
image of a cluster of shelled almonds.

A Canopied Balcony~
   Jutting out a short distance from the building, this balcony 
is enough for two or three people to stand side by side, but 
little else. It is formed of solid support beams and white 
brick, tiled with faded blue ceramic tiles and framed in a simple 
wrought-iron railing. Attached to a pair of iron poles, a stiff 
canvas canopy, left its natural off-white color, offers a small 
degree of protection from the elements overhead. 
   An uncovered arch returns to the small apartment to the east.

   A musky animal smell hangs heavy in the air of this small, 
somewhat adobe stable. Brass lanterns swing, gently from the 
rafters above, lighting the narrow passage before the rows of 
stalls. Dried straw is strewn about the floor, and feed is 
stacked in the cool, dark corner next to a number of water 
troughs. A reed double-door leads to the west and a narrow reed 
door leads east.

short distance across the surface of the water. Tall pilings at 
the end of the dock are wrapped with thick, hemp mooring lines. 
A large weathered lantern sits the upon the tarred top of a 
dockside piling. A large barrel is set to one side and draped 
with a tattered net.

   Well manicured grass spreads its velvety reach to the lazy

moving water while a small grove of sandalwood trees keep silent 
sentry over flowerbeds of intoxicating jasmine. Creeper vines 
climb the house walls rising up from a thick border of tended 
shrubs. A narrow path of intracately laid white adobe bricks 
leads across the grounds. A small flock of peacocks and peahens 
wander the grounds.

than the rest of the building and sacks of grains and hops are 
stacked neatly in a corner. Crates litter the floor and a large

embellished in spidery thin veins. The walls are made of cool, 
white stone, austere and business-like, although it has been 
somewhat covered by a pair of black banners. One banner bears 
the Fahad'Jafari seal, while the other displays a scroll of 
parchment set with a star.

A Garden Courtyard~
   This courtyard is filled with flourishing greenery, tender 
blades of grass peeking up out between the loose, white brick 
pathway that takes a roundabout turn toward the door of the 
southern house. A few simple vines have begun to creep about the 
white stone walls that surrounds the garden in relative privacy. 
Although fairly small size, it could still fit a few small pieces 
of furniture and perhaps a bit of an herb garden, but this area 
appears mostly for show than for practical purposes. A gated 
stone stair curves gently upward.

An Inviting Kitchen and Living Area~
   With a tall, domed ceiling, this room seems spacious without 
actually offering that much room. The ceiling is pierced in the 
center by a ring of triangular shaped windows, filled with glass 
to keep the weather out. A hammered bronze brazier hangs from 
the center on a sturdy chain, providing light when the sunlight 
fails. The floor is made of cool, unadorned white bricks, while 
the walls are pained with a beautiful shade of crimson. The 
quaint kitchen area takes up one corner of the room, while a good 
portion of the area near the front door comprises living space. 
Several narrow windows fill the western and northern wall, 
capturing any cool breezes from outside and allowing it in. 
   In a doorway of typical width for one large door, a pair of 
lightly stained oak doors opens to the garden outside to the 
north. An arched door sits within the eastern wall, made of 
dark-stained oak to give it a rich wood color, while a narrow, 
unimposing, blue-painted door sits off to the south.

Airy Bed Chamber~
   The six angled walls of this room have been painted a deep

the floors and flat ceiling. The walls themselves are of 
different lengths, four of them narrower than the east and west 
facing walls. Set high on the walls are a staggered line of 
small square windows, barely enough to fit a child through but 
enough in quantity to provide ample sunlight during the day. A 
few narrow-ledged sconces hold the place for oil lamps to offer 
light during the night.

white marring the solid color. The walls are made of white stone 
and have been left largely unadorned. The ceiling is high enough 
only to hold a few hanging lamps without danger of them hitting a 
passer-by in the head. 
   A door to the east bears a gold plaque beside it, while a 
sturdy-looking door at the end of the hallway has a blue sign.

the wide double doors let in light during the day and allow a 
clear view of the outside no matter the hour. The floor is

A Cavernous Warehouse Building~
   In lieu of breaking up the building into smaller rooms, this 
warehouse has been left open as one large area. Dust hangs in 
the air and shadows lurk in every corner. Crates have been 
stacked high, organized in such a way that paths are left to 
wander through and inspect contents. Loose floorboards, shards 
of pottery and straw mingle with the sand that covers the ground, 
which seems to be a mix of wood planks and brick. 
   A heavy door to the north leads to an entrance room and a 
smaller door is set in the east wall near the front of the 
building. A treacherous-looking, sloped wooden ladder leads ten 
feet up to a loft that hangs off of the back of the room.

contains many deep pockets that reach back into the walls, so 
that no matter how much light is added it always seems dark. 
Parts of the walls have been reinforced with brick or makeshift 
support from broken crate slats. Iron torch sconces have been 
mounted on the wall at various intervals. Dirt and sand make up 
the floor and movement is difficult amongst the many crates and 
boxes stacked all the way to the low ceiling.

A Bustling, Medicinal-Scented Shop~
   Clean and plain best describes this shop with its utilitarian 
angles and pristine white stone construction. The pale blue, 
ceramic-tiled floor is nearly spotless, obviously swept and 
scrubbed regularly to keep the dirt away. The plain pattern on 
the brick walls are interrupted along the east and west sides by 
moderately sized windows, allowing a river-scented cross breeze 
to flow through. A cold, clinical table rests in the center of 
the shop, while a couple of cots rests behind a white cotton 
curtain along the south wall. 
   An arched door leads to the loud souk just to the east, while 
a whitewashed door to the north heads into the back room.

A Clean, Cluttered Workshop~
   While simple and spacious in design, this room makes full use 
of its space by offering it to all manner of storage and work 
spaces. The untreated white stone walls hold shelves and 
organizational drawers. And the plain white stone floor is kept 
free of dust, as is the long, cluttered workbench that takes up 
much of the wall. A slit of a small window sits high along the 
eastern wall, just barely clearing its neighbor's roof, often 
carrying wafts of sweetly baked aromas inside. 
   A whitewashed door returns to the shop front to the south. 
Squeezed between a shelf and a tall cabinet, a narrow stockroom 
door has barely enough space to clear from the doorway.

A Well-Organized Stockroom~
   A tight fit for any average-sized person, shelves line the 
cold stone walls, floor to ceiling. There is some built in 
adjustability to the various shelves, able to hold small compact 
objects to something more moderately bulky. Scribbled labels, 
either in picture or in script, mark some of the shelves to allow 
quick discovery of their contents. The plain stone floor seems 
to have collected a bit of sand, likely as the room is difficult 
to sweep out.

A Delightful Tended Garden~
   Fruit and nut trees grow in a small mixed grove near the vine 
covered house. Rose bushes of all colors border the base of the 
wall. Tiny patches of tended flower and vegetable gardens form a 
gay patchwork of color across the sprawling grounds. A small 
vineyard stands in neat rows on the far side of the small grove.

Expansion to the Garden~
   Spreading out to the north and east, the garden continues, 
following around the white granite tiles. The granite that paves 
the walkways slowly becomes pale rose toned tiles the farther 
into the garden it leads, until it is nothing but rosy marble. 
Lush greenery fill into the meandering walkways either in tiered 
planters or directly from the ground, most being flowers and 
vines, although a few strips of verdant lawn offer a cool place 
to sit.

A Corner of the Beautifully Tended Garden~
   Rose-hued marble paves the delicate, wandering paths of the 
garden here. Shade spreads over much of the area from an 
expansive trellis that spans one corner, fragrant vines creeping 
up along the white structure. Added shade is provided by the 
airy swaths of cotton that billow off at an angle from the tall 
trellis and reach into a point over the beginning of an 
unobtrusive fountain. The fountain itself appears mostly as the 
means of an artificial brook set within the elaborately carved 
marble, trickling merrily to the north with a slightly western 
curve. 
   A gaily striped trolley sits under the southern shade of the 
garden, bearing food and drinks.

A Shaded Pond Within the Gardens~
   The softly tinkling brook ends here, spilling its cool, 
crystal water from the marble channel into a deep blue pond. 
Shading liberally, airy swaths of cotton are draped from pole to 
pole, criss-crossing in the center just over the water where it 
is held up precariously by a delicate, white twisting post. A 
sampling of the famous blue water lily grows within the pond, 
often times hiding away the fish scaled in their blues, reds, and 
oranges. Flowers and other decorative plants line the rosy 
marble paving.

A Quiet Garden Alcove~
   Hedged in minimal privacy, this alcove is encircled by a 
curving iron trellis, overtaken by delicately fragrant vines, the 
creeping tendrils kept under control by frequent tending. With 
intimate seating and circular rose-colored marble tiling, it is 
obvious this was meant more for solitude than for the admiring of 
flourishing foliage. A sweeping cotton canopy drapes overhead, 
offering shade and only a small amount of protection from the 
weather.

A Fragrant, Tree-Dotted Park~
   Filled with lush trees and the sound of running water, the 
rosy marble path becomes more single minded here as it turns 
around the different trees and follows the line of a carved 
marble-tiled brook to the west. Flowering plants accent the area 
around the trees, while much gives way to cobblestone borders, 
alight with a myriad of soft colours. Velvety soft green grass 
also skirts parts of the trees, resting on ever damp beds of 
soil. An artfully winding path fades off to the east, where a 
small, simple stone building can be seen nestled among more 
garden area.

An Expansive City Garden~
   Plush greenery and flourishing, colorful plant life spread 
over this narrowing portion of the gardens. Gone are the marble 
tiles, giving way to quaint dirt paths bordered by softly 
colorful cobblestone. All the effort gone into creating a lavish 
garden seems to have faded in this section, although it is no 
less kept or cared for. The shade is minimal, offered only by a 
lone fig tree that has been planted beside a small stone 
building, seeming more for utility than for anything of general 
interest.

A Stone Toolshed~
   Built by coarse stone bricks, this building is only large 
enough to fit a few bodies at once alongside the many tools that 
are housed within this structure. A low-angled roof made of 
reeds forms the ceiling, casting shade and ventilation in on 
sunny days, but doing little to protect it from hard rain. 
Narrow windows on all walls hold hinged shutters that open from 
the bottom, able to be propped open enough to catch a stray 
breeze.

   Simply designed, this room is a plain rectangular shape. As 
though to offset the simplicity, the walls have been painted blue 
in an artfully decorative pattern, creating subtle texture over 
the brick. The floor is plain white brick, offering little 
interest to the eye. Set along the southern and eastern walls, a 
set of decently sized windows open wide to the elements, allowing 
light and weather to pour in. A simple brazier hangs from a 
short chain on the pale blue-painted ceiling, filled with the 
glow of golden firelight at night.

holding assorted scrolls tomes, potions, salves, pills, and other

small low-table serves as a counter surrounded by a set of 
comfortable crimson pillows to sit on. The faint, mixed scents 
of spices, perfumes, and desert flowers linger in the air.

rest on sconces about the room, while a large, high-set window 
lets a little outside light in during the day. Bookshelves line 
the western and eastern walls. A large round crimson mat 
decorates the floor, tiled with cool ceramic of an almost black 
hue. A spacious desk and workbench fills a good deal of the 
room, along with a few storage fixtures.

caravan yard is little more than a wide, dirt-packed road. It 
stretches around the backside of the building, with just barely 
enough room to drive two caravans abreast of each other and would 
obviously require great skill in maneuvering the wagons. Cast in 
shade most of the time, due to the narrow space between the 
buildings, a cooler temperature lingers even with the cloistered 
feel of the air. The rest of the surrounding scenery is 
comprised of brick walls and impatient horses and their colorful 
caravans.

smallest, most delicate flowers to the front. A small nook with 
a brick-built bench near the door is shaded by several leafy 
palms, and mostly secreted by large blossoming flowers that issue 
an intoxicating combination of scents.

tiles laid in a starburst pattern. The walls are painted a 
white, though warmer, shade as if tinged with the same sunny 
color as the floor design. The room is sparse in its decor, 
though there are a few benches for seating placed around the 
room. Two clear glass-paned windows, one on each side of a 
wooden door, provide light and a view of the courtyard. A set of 
narrow stairs winds upwards to a small wooden door in the roof. 
   A solid looking wooden door leads south while open archways 
lead to the north, west, and east. A door hatch also leads

secured with white-painted, half-window grates with a starburst 
design. Any element the weather provides easily drifts through 
this room, whether wind or rain when not hindered by the sapphire 
painted wooden shutters attached at the walls. Most of the 
seating in this room clusters around a wide, red-bricked hearth 
in the center of the single windowless wall. Under one window by 
the far opposite wall stands a desk and small chair from which 
the view can be seen when the shutters are open.

The wall opposite the cupboard is taken up by a modest hearth and 
a cooking stove. Two white, iron-grated window openings to the

The House of Ash'Tellis Butcher Store~
   The floor in this store is particularly tidy, kept clean much 
to the comfort of the customers. The front shop contains many 
racks of butchered meat of various sorts. The meats have been 
placed neatly on trays, probably for the purpose of better 
display and freshness of the meats itself. At the far end of the 
store is a long wooden counter, and just behind it, a series of 
iron meat hooks has been arranged neatly, hanging unprocessed 
carcasses. This room has a rather strong smell to it, not 
necessarily unpleasant, but still one that may become 
overwhelming with prolonged exposure.

The Butcher Storeroom~
   Not much furniture is placed in this room. Only a few crates

store the goods. The white brick floor here is dirty with dried

places.

The House of Ash'Tellis Wood Store~
   Formed of smooth, plain white bricks, this rarely spacious 
store front holds ample space to display a few pieces of 
furniture that line the western and eastern walls, creating a 
pathway that needs to the counter along the southern side. The 
ceiling is reinforced by thick, heavy beams of wood, bare and 
untreated, except for the glass-encased lantern that hangs from a 
chain to light the room. Various objects of wood, smaller and 
easier to manage, sit on display along the sales counter. The 
scent of fresh wood pervades this shop quite prominently.

The House of Ash'Tellis Armor Shop~
   Paved in rough grey stone, the floor of this shop is kept 
clean except for the occasional loose bits of sawdust that 
manages to track through between the two doorways. The walls, 
like the ceiling, are made of white adobe bricks, little 
decoration added to their surfaces. A series of racks and 
shelves have been arranged neatly in each corner of the room, 
displaying the wares. A few wooden mannequins line one wall, 
each bearing different types of armor. Lighting this shop day 
and night are a few lanterns that have been set high along the 
walls. Just a few steps before the door, a long, plain counter 
flanks the southern end of the shop.

A Wide Workshop~
   The pungent, wholly unpleasant odor that fills this room is 
easily its initial feature, seeming to waft from the curing 
leather that is stored in one corner. The smooth, clean lines of 
the white brick walls are broken by the series of high-set, small 
windows, obviously meant to help ventilate the room. The floor 
is made of grey stone, smoothed and mortared with meticulous care 
to make the surface as seamless as possible for easy cleanup. 
Ample workspace lines the southern wall, with storage for tools 
and supplies arranged nearby.

A Wood-Smelling Workshop~
   While not overly roomy, the features of this workshop are set 
in an efficient way to make the most use of the limited space. 
Walls of white brick lead up into a ceiling of the same make, the 
only difference being the wooden beams that support it. The 
floor is made of grey stone, smoothed and nearly flawless in its 
construction, if not for the nearly constant layer of saw dust 
and wood shavings. A brass oil lamp hangs from the ceiling, 
offering light to augment whatever is offered by the small window 
set along the southern wall.

A Warm, Bustling Kitchen~
   This kitchen seems cramped for the amount of bustle it sees, 
when it truly holds ample room. The white stone walls are 
unadorned except for the shelves and cabinets that have been 
affixed to them. The floor is of plain grey stone tiles and 
appears to have some trouble keeping spotlessly clean as cooking 
and working continuously tend to soil it. The ceiling supports a 
hole for ventilation, which offers only minimal help as it seems 
to always be various degrees of warm here. Nonetheless, the 
design of the kitchen is made for simple necessity without any 
frills, much unlike the more public areas.

A Small Brewing Alcove~
   Plain, untreated white stone bricks form the walls and 
ceiling, broken only by thick wooden support beams overhead and a 
hanging brass lantern. The floor is cold, grey stone, the tiles 
a simple and utilitarian pattern of squares. Often warm here for 
the brewing fires that run, narrow slits form four windows along 
the western wall which do little to add ventilation. 
   Along the wall a gap in the floor turns into a set of narrow 
stairs which lead into the cellar.

holds various shelves and trays used for service in the inn. The 
walls, ceiling, and floor are plain stone, white except for the 
floor which is grey. Even with little room to move, the floor is 
kept well-swept and free of spills.

An Arched Passageway~
   A gracefully arching ceiling seems to be the crowning glory of 
this passageway, beautifully carved ivory framing the peaked 
curves overhead. The carvings display a nearly chaotic scene of 
water lilies and pads tangled over rippling water. A colorful, 
chaotic arrangement of ceramic tiles in different shades of blue 
cover the arch and fade into a swirling layer of cream plaster 
along the walls. The floor is covered in diamond-shaped mahogany 
tiles, scattered on occasion by ivory. A smoothly sweeping 
staircase rises up along the southern wall, met by several small, 
square windows, leading to a second floor. The hallway continues 
to the north, while a broad pointed arch leads into a large, 
dimly lit room to the east.

A Tapestry-Laden Hallway~
   Dark mahogany tiles cover the floor, broken in places by a 
starkly contrasting diamond of ivory. The ceiling is slightly 
arched and rounded, painted with abstract images and flourishes 
which are cast in perpetual light from a pair of hanging bronze 
lanterns. The creamy colored walls are obscured in most places 
by a few narrow tapestries, displaying a tangle of flowering 
vines on a field of wine red. And although each one is unique, 
they all share that same theme. 
   The hallway continues unhindered to the south. However, a 
door made of delicately woven reeds, a dark pattern over white 
birchwood, bars the way to the north, while a set of narrow 
double doors sits to the east. Standing out from the others, a 
thick, dark wooden door rests to the west, trimmed in aquamarine 
paint.

   An extensive fresco covers the plastered wall and ceiling in 
stunning detail, displaying a desert oasis scene in the midst of 
a spring that cascades down a small mountain of rocks. Hazy 
brown tiles of glossy ceramic pave the floor and along the lower 
quarter of the wall. A trio of brushed brass lamps set along the 
wall burns oil to provide ample light at night. A pair of arched 
windows sit within the northern and eastern walls, paned with 
frosted glass and barred by iron for security.

A Spacious, Comfortable Room~
   The walls of this decently sized room have been plastered with 
a very pale shade of blue plaster, the tones uneven for a 
decorative pattern. The ceiling bears the same color and texture 
between the dark wooden support beams. A set of silvery oil 
lamps hang overhead, casting light during the darker hours. Sea 
blue ceramic tiles pave the floor in a large diamond pattern, 
trimmed around the edge of the room with light yellow tiles which 
spread roughly three inches up the wall. Two long windows, 
filled with clear glass panes and secured by iron grating on the 
outside, line the eastern wall, curtained by ivory linen.

An Exquisite Gambling Parlor~
   Decked in refinement and lavish decor, this room maintains a 
formal appearance. The mahogany tile floor is covered in a 
single, massive rug, dulling the sound of footsteps and absorbing 
noise that would otherwise echo against the stone construction. 
The ceiling is deceptively high, vaulted with wood inlaid with 
ivory or cream-colored tiles in contrasting whorls. The walls 
hold oil lamps on sconces to provide ample light, the swirling 
plastered surface itself painted in blues, greens, and earthen 
browns to depict a hedge of reeds at a river's edge. 
   A wide arch, pointed at the top and painted wine red, leads 
out into a passageway.

color. The rest of the hall is plastered with a white rippling 
design, forcing a clean, airy appearance upon the otherwise 
unadorned walls. The floor is covered with pale blue tiles, the 
plain square patterned given pause by a scattered array of 
gold-veined white marble. 
   A beautifully formed door sits in an arched doorway to the 
east, washed with white. The hallway continues to the north, 
while a gracefully curved staircase leads to the floor below.

A Clean, Airy Room~
   While not a large room, there is still ample space between the 
various furniture laid out. The floor is tiled with a nearly 
white ceramic tiling, subtly swirled with uneven tones of ivory 
for the sake of texture. The walls are plastered with pale blue, 
trimmed along the floor and ceiling with yellow-shaded marble. 
The ceiling appears to share the same tile as the floor. Two 
tall windows have been set along the eastern wall, curtained with 
ivory cotton gauze and bearing ivory shutters for when the 
weather necessitates their use. A solitary bronze lamp hangs 
from the ceiling, shedding its warm glow during the evening.

A Beautiful Wine Red Suite~
   Black marble tiles have been covered by an elaborate, dark red 
rug on the floor of this spacious room, creating a plush walking 
surface over the cold, hard marble. Ivory tiles weave a diagonal 
pattern along the walls, intermixed with wine red marble veined 
with subtle streaks of gold. A series of tall windows line the 
eastern wall and are shuttered by ivory-painted shutters in bad 
weather, curtained with heavy linen of a wine red hue. The 
ceiling overhead bears wine red, ceramic tiles, partially covered 
in airy chiffon of the same color where it drapes over the bed 
along the wall. A glass and bronze brazier hangs from the center 
of the room, casting a warm, uneven light during the evening 
hours.

of genuine wood with a warm, golden grain and light staining. It 
has been sanded to a beautiful smoothness and holds a slight 
gloss. Ceramic ivory tile , highly embellished, covers the walls 
in a diamond shaped pattern, spotted by gleaming gold tiles. The 
ceiling is hidden behind great swathes of golden hued fabric, 
having a light, airy texture and coming to drape over the bed 
against the wall. A series of tall windows line the eastern 
wall, curtained by gold-colored cotton and shuttered by 
ivory-painted shutters when the weather grows bad. Glass lamps 
have been placed at intervals along the walls, burning oil in the 
darker hours to cast a warm light over the room.

A Cool, Tiled Wine Cellar~
   Cool and badly lit this cellar is, at least, dry. The 
flawlessly mortared brick-work does an exceptional job of locking 
out the damp of the clay earth. Only two dim oil lamps rest on 
narrow ledges on either ends of the small, rectangular cellar. 
The air is stuffy, receiving little movement and dust seems to 
collect uncaringly upon the white ceramic tile floor. The 
ceiling is low, which proves a benefit as the narrow staircase 
that leads up into the floor above has no railing.

A Smoky, Dimly Lit Room~
   Set upon thick cedar planks, the flow of water can be heard 
just beneath the floorboards. The walls are a combination of 
wood and woven reed construction, the reed stalks bound closely 
together to keep any drafts away. Several large windows rest 
along the southern wall with shutters that swing upward and lift 
into awnings in fair weather. The framework of this moderately 
spacious room is solid cedar, the ceiling able to hold the weight 
of a second floor. A few study columns down the middle of the 
room hold torches for light, and the air is almost always 
permeated by a smoky haze. 
   A narrow reed door rests in the wall to the west, its surface 
sealed with the blackness of pitch.

The Fighting Pit~
   This large round building is enough to house many bodies on 
the staggered stone benches and make-shift seating. The walls 
are made of white stone and clay, piled high and forming a large 
dome, open in the center to the sky. Its decor is sparse and 
simple, aside from the provided seating. A wide roped ring in 
the center would have room for two or three fights at once, 
strewn with bloodstained dirt and straw.

A Crumbling Stone Stairway~
   Rubble is strewn haphazardly along the broken stone steps, 
making the climb difficult. The walls of the stairwell are damp, 
brown-stained granite. They are marked and scarred with time and 
worn down by the labours of man. Narrow and dark the walls 
crumble if touched, sending a shower of dust and pebbles 
downward. The crumbling stone work has been remarkably laid, 
precise in size with hairline joints. A trickle of filthy water 
flows in from above, filling the air with its dank and foul 
smell.

A Turn in the Crumbling Stairwell~
   The carefully laid stones form a curve to the north here 
leading into an arched brown stone passage. Faint paintings of 
men in desert garb can be discerned here. The colors faded and 
the stones broken over time. There is a break in the western 
wall where the stones have fallen away and in. No floor or wall 
can be seen but foul air rises up through the chasm hinting at 
what lays at the bottom of the drop. The stair continues 
downward.

An Arched Passage~
   A small landing opens up to an arched passage. The stone arch 
is carefully laid and balanced. It has withstood time and wear 
and while covered with mold and damp it is solid and unbroken. 
The floor of the passage is intricately laid brick, darkened with 
time and dampness. The walls of the narrow walkway of precisely 
laid granite stone blocks covered in crumbling white stained 
plaster. Faded murals of men hunting in desert garb can be made 
out on the broken plaster.

   The way south stops abruptly here, the carefully laid 
stonework coming to a halt before a split in the floor. The 
darkness below seems impenetrable, though the split seems wide 
enough to jump. On the walls here a mural depicts dark-skinned 
men poised to strike with their long spears at a group of fierce 
looking lions, barely discernable under the mould and damp which 
now covers the plastered walls. The hallway turns to the east, 
leading to a similar hallway.

Moving Along Stone Stairs~
   The carefully laid stone stairs continue down here, leading to 
the crumbling entrance of a dark passage. The walls, covered in 
years of grime and dust, faintly depict an ancient battle; tall, 
armoured men facing each other with bronze weapons in hand. The 
stonework, though clearly laid with a masterful hand, is 
crumbling away in places and the occasional small piece of debris 
falls from above.

A Dark, Watery Pit~
   Stagnant, dark water rises to knee height in this dark pit, 
only the occasional ripple forming on the surface from mysterious 
movement in its depths. The walls of this small room have been 
built with great care, the elaborate stonework strong and solid 
despite the damp. Spiders and other large, grotesque-looking 
insects cover the walls, making every corner their own. A tiled 
frieze depicting geometric patterns of differing colours makes 
its way around the walls at about head height, stopping only for 
a rusty iron grate in the southern wall.

wall large enough to allow a man room enough to squeeze through. 
The ceiling is made from well-cut stone, though time has 
certainly taken its toll on the architecture, small pieces of 
debris falling occasionally. Likely due to this the floor is 
covered in small pieces of fallen stone, crumbling underfoot.

better preserved. An arched doorway leads east while the passage

Its yawning mouth just out of reach. A broken ledge juts out 
from the southern wall. The air is dank and musty and mold grows 
on the rotting plaster and stones.

enough to cram a few bodies inside if not for the lining of 
shelves and storage pockets. There is barely enough room to move

space is efficient for storage. A single door closes it up 
securely, fitted with a small lock.

A Shaded Bathhouse Courtyard~
   A clean, colorful tiled pathway leads the way between the 
street and the gated entrance of the bathhouse, the tiles 
fragmented into a fine mosaic of varying white and blue hues that 
form vague watery swirls. The walls of the building wrap around 
the courtyard, large blocks of white stone a pristine contrast to 
the beginnings of the garden areas. Flowers and lush green 
foliage fill out the area, with the path shaded by a reed arbor, 
heavy with vines and supported by a double row of fig trees. 
While the large trees offer excellent shade, their fruit doesn't 
seem serviceable. 
   The courtyard is separated from the larger garden by an iron 
fence to allow a full, unobstructed view of the grounds, a gate 
set at the western end of the path. To the east, the mosaic path 
connects to the street.

The Public Bathhouse Gardens~
   Spacious and lush, this is a veritable garden. Trees and 
flowered planters dot the winding white stone walkways that lead 
into intimate patios that serve as small social centers, slightly 
hedged by climbing vines. Each social pocket is paved with a 
mosaic of a different color, the tilework filled with varying 
shades of tiny ceramic pieces, shaded even by fruit trees or a 
gauzy cotton canopy. Filled often by the relaxing bathhouse 
patrons, the conversations rarely fall over a soft hum, save for 
the occasional outburst at the gambling corner. 
   The north and south paths lead to the men's and women's baths, 
respectively, while a wide archway heads into the steam room to 
the west. The iron fence and gate separates the garden from the 
courtyard entrance to the east, where the path eventually returns 
to the street.

The Men's Baths~
   With a high, arching ceiling overhead, daylight pours in 
through the many star-shaped holes created in the intricate white 
stone construction, lit by hanging braziers in the absence of 
natural light. Large, arched alcoves border the white stone 
walls, the pillared supports tiled with whites and blues that 
compliment the simpler tile on the floor. Tiled by cobalt blue 
ceramics, a several small baths have been set within the main 
part of the room, with a few placed under the semi-privacy of the 
alcoved edges. The water in each is kept constantly warm as 
evident by the tendrils of steam that rise from the surface, 
filling the room with a low rising haze.

flowering fountain in the very center. The water is kept 
constantly warm as evident by the tendrils of steam that rise 
from its surface. A ledge set within the entire pool serves both 
as a step and as seating, and while the water isn't deep enough 
for swimming, it is ample for emersion.

A Steam-filled Room~
   In a constant state of fog, this room's construction is mostly 
obscured. White stone comprises the walls, and star-shaped beams 
of dim light filter through overhead from the ceiling lost in the 
obscurity of steam. Although whether it is by sunlight or a 
lamp, it remains uncertain as the effect is the same. The far 
wall is set with wide marble steps, cushioned with rolls of 
towels that suggest it is more a means of seating than a 
staircase. The means of the ample steam and warmth within the 
room, two braziers sit on the floor level, filled with beds of 
steaming coal and protected by an iron grating. 
   A small door along the southern wall can barely be seen 
through the haze, while the wide archway to the east with the 
garden beyond is easily seen.

serviceable. The walls are plain white stone, as is the floor. 
Various shelves line the walls, offering different sizes and each 
fitted with a covering of some kind to further protect it from

Scorpion's Bite Smoking Den~
   The room has a low ceiling and no windows the air hangs and 
lingers, the strong scent of various smokes filling it, it is 
stuffy and warm, only a slight breeze provided by the curtain to 
the outside. With enough room for even the tallest of men to 
stand it, the ceiling seems low to the ground. Candles hang in 
cages from it, giving the room some measure of light and casting 
sharp dancing shadows across the floor. The floor itself shows 
plain grey bricks, rectangular in shape and fitted closed 
together. Across one side of the room a long counter stretches, 
a curtain leading to another room at the end. The few patrons 
that are seen are quiet, their collective voices never raising 
above a murmur.

a line of shelves in it to hold various items for sale. Set onto 
the shelves are jars and packages of various drugs and smoking 
supplies among a few odds and ends for easy reference of the shop

A Hazy, Smoke-filled Lounge~
   A thick haze of smoke permeates the air in this dimly lit 
room. The walls are painted a luxurious shade of crimson, and 
the floor has been well-maintained. Bronze scorpion-shaped 
sconces hang from the walls, giving off ambient lighting to the 
room. The mixed scent of various smoked herbs and resins fills 
the chamber. The floor itself is bare of decoration and lacking 
in furniture. 
   A thin gauze curtain is the only partition separating this 
lounge from the storefront to the east.

A Room Overlooking the Garden~
   Comprised of pristine white bricks, this room is fairly 
spacious and uncluttered, bearing a simple design in architecture 
with the exception of the grand chandelier which hangs from the 
middle of the domed ceiling, casting its light throughout the 
room. The floor is made of lustrous white marble, and a broad 
glass window opens into a view of the garden to the north. A 
series of brightly woven tapestries hangs from the southern wall, 
displaying different animals of the hunt. 
   A white door along the northern wall, opens out into the 
garden outside, while the room narrows into a hallway to the 
south.

A Long, Narrow Hallway~
   With little of note in the way of decor, this white brick room 
is simply a long and narrow hallway. The ceiling leaves more 
than ample space overhead, the plain brickwork reflecting the 
light cast from glass-encased lanterns that sit upon high-placed 
brackets. The white marble of the floor is practically obscured 
in the wine red runner that carpets the length of the hall. 
   Curving up along the corner, a flight of stairs leads up to a 
set of double doors that have been carved with an intricate 
pattern. The hallway bends to the north and east into different 
rooms.

   Bearing a high, arched ceiling, this spacious room is formed 
of smooth white bricks and is gracefully rounded for the sake of 
aesthetics. A circle of decoratively shape windows set along the 
borders of the ceiling allow natural light to pour into the room 
in the daytime hours. The floor itself is paved in white marble 
tiles, polished to a smooth shine, each tile perfectly placed for 
uniformity throughout. 
   Through an arched doorway, the narrow hallway can be seen to 
the west, while another doorway opens to another room to the 
east.

Simple Servants' Quarters~
   Bare and utilitarian, this room features plain, unadorned 
brick walls, lacking the natural light or airflow of windows. 
The floor is likewise formed of the same bricks, the pale grey 
surface subtly uneven in color and forming a vague, interesting 
pattern. A smoky-tinted glass lantern attaches to the wall to 
the side of the only doorway, so when it is lit, it leaves the 
far corners of the room still left in shadow. 
   The only doorway to the south is fitted with a cheap, simple 
curtain in an attempt to muffle the sounds of the kitchen.

A Private Chamber with an Oriel Window~
   This is a beautiful and lavishly constructed room, arguably 
the best room of the house. Set with different colored glass, a 
wide, oriel window has been set on the eastern wall, able to look 
over the front garden and allowing streams of colored light into 
the room during the day. The floor is covered in darkly stained 
wood planks, smoothed and treated to a polished shine. The white 
brick walls have been formed in a clever work of masonry, 
creating interesting patterns along the base and top of the walls 
to resemble arches. 
   Carved with a beautifully intricate pattern, a set of double 
doors sits along the southern wall.

A Thin, Snaking Street~
   Nestled between the tightly fitted buildings and shops along 
the road, this street snakes its way in a generally east and west 
direction. It is a narrow road comparatively, its paving made of 
uneven stone where its original color has been lost beneath time 
and wear and dirt. Despite the number of shops that line along 
here, the noise is kept to a faint din with only the occasional 
shout or odd mewling of a cat to break the constant, soft hum of 
working merchants. 
   Along the southern side of the road, a string of three shops 
share a common entrance, the double doors carved with the figure 
of a black prancing stallion.

The Wadi Mining Company~
   This moderately-sized room seems to serve as both an office 
and a shop together. Cold, well-mortared white stone form the 
walls and the floor, discoloration evident in various places 
along the floor as signs of its age and use, along with a regular 
layer of dirt and dust. The ceiling holds a thick layer of 
red-brown plaster, avoiding the wooden support beams overhead and 
leaving the heavy beams bare but the dark stain applied to it. 
Brass braziers hang from the ceiling on chains, casting uneven 
light over the room at all hours. Iron-barred, arched windows 
adorn the southern wall to allow for ventilation. 
   A wrought-iron gate sits in the southern doorway, bearing an 
iron likeness of a pickaxe. Set into the northern wall, a heavy 
cedar door securely bars entrance into the backrooms.

from hooks screwed into the rafters. The scent of horses fills

   Grey stone mortared with white clay form the plain shape of 
this sizable room. The floor is clean and paved with red-brown 
ceramic tiles. Spacious enough for the amount of furnishings 
that graces its interior, it is still set in an efficient manner. 
The room is designated into dining and sleeping areas, while 
looking ill-suited for either. Small windows sit within the 
southern wall, too high to reach without the means of a step 
ladder and set with iron bars. 
   A set of stairs leads up to a second floor while doors sit in 
each direction, leading to the street to the south or into the

The floor is neatly tiled with grey stone bricks and bears a few 
chips and other sides of wear. The workroom is set with only the 
necessary furnishings to create an efficient workspace. Small 
windows are set along the southern and western walls, barred with 
iron and placed very high along the wall, appearing more for the 
sake of ventilation than light or a view.

A Tidy Servant's Room~
   Cosy and neat this room is nestled deep within the thick adobe 
walls of the building. Shiny copper sconces hang on either side 
the door and a matching lantern swings from the ceiling beams. 
The walls are whitewashed and as cool to the touch as the shiny 
sapphire tiled floor underfoot. A long slanted slit in the adobe 
lets in defused light but keeps out the heat of the day. It 
cools the air as it travels in through the angled slit in the 
thick adobe.

The Cleaver's Butchery~
   Constructed of cool, solid white bricks, the walls of this 
shop form a near perfect square, although it seems to extend just 
a bit further north from the front door. The ceiling show 
evidence of the same workmanship as the walls, bearing raw wooden 
support beams and unadorned brickwork. The floor is a plain grey 
stone, the tiles mortared together with an ivory grout that 
displays a few brown stains despite being cleaned and tidy. A 
service counter sits along the eastern side of the shop, hooks 
and display cases set up behind it. 
   A thick door opens into the backroom to the north, while the 
front doorway opens back out into the street to the west.

A Musty-Smelling Storeroom~
   Leaving little the way of space or work function, this small 
room appears to be nothing more than a storage space. Shelves 
line the straight, white brick walls in efficient order, while a 
set of meat hooks hang from the wooden support beam overhead. 
The floor, while relatively clean, bears brownish stains upon the 
grey stone tile, many spots having soaked into the ivory grout 
between. The cool air doesn't move much through here, and 
instead, it contains a heavy, musty scent.

A Narrow Landing~
   A sturdy cedar stairway opens to a narrow planked landing. 
Lapstrake walls unpainted are varnished to a high shine. The 
clinker-built ceiling is mixed indistinguishable wood with a 
large polished brass lantern swinging from its support beam. 
Matching sconces dot the walls at each door. The floor is sanded 
smooth and waxed to a fine shine.

   Large and breezy this room is quite comfy and cozy. Carefully 
built lapstrake walls are sanded and varnished to a high shine. 
The simple planked ceiling is painted sky blue. The floor is 
crafted from intricately laid wood tiles. Scrubbed and polished 
it is covered by several small colorful woven rugs. A wide cedar 
shuttered window graces the wall offering a panoramic view of the

Inside a Plain Canvas Stall~
   Relatively spacious to contain a variety of wares, this stall 
holds a makeshift counter and shelves, formed of old wooden 
planks and heavy white bricks. The walls and roof of the stall 
are made of stiff canvas, left a plain cream color and held up by 
reed poles. A green flap fills the entrance, opening easily back 
to the souk. 
   A heavy stockbox sits in the corner behind the counter, locked 
tightly by a large lock.

canvas and is held up by thick, sturdy wooden poles. The 
entrance is formed of the same canvas, tied open to allow freedom 
of passage in and out. A makeshift counter sits along the back 
formed of worn, ancient wooden planks and clay bricks. A shelf 
of similar make serves as a display case.

An Armorsmith's Workroom~
   The plain, clean angles of this small room is plastered with 
an ivory coat, the surface uneven but made of sound construction. 
The floor is neatly tiled with grey stone bricks and bears a few 
chips and other sides of wear. The workroom is set with only the 
necessary furnishings to create an efficient workspace. Small 
windows are set along the northern wall, barred with iron and 
placed very high along the wall, appearing more for the sake of 
ventilation than light or a view.

vstr Every month, you will receive an automatic supply of goods with which to craft. The materials will be left on the floor of your workroom, -only- if there are none there already. So you must keep your workroom tidy, or no new supplies will be delivered. If there are other apprentices in your trade, you will have to share work space and supplies. Please be courteous of your fellow apprentices!
vbr -
vstr When you have completed goods ready to be stocked in your master's shop, you should place it in the azure colored bin. The "senior apprentice" stationed in your workroom will deliver it to the shop for you.

vstr Please be aware that the amount of delivered materials and your pay will not be increased with time or progression of your skill. If you find that you can now make something for which you have no supplies, then you cannot make it.

A Small Confined Area~
   This is a rather small, oval-shaped room following the same 
theme as downstairs. Similar scarlet curtains fall from the 
walls, and it is dimly lit in the same manner by well placed 
indigo and violet candles which illuminate the various shelving 
and cabinets displaying the current stock. The floor is paved 
with loose, pale grey stone tiles and creaks faintly with each 
footfall while a small, low table forms the counter off to one 
side. 
   A spiralling iron staircase leads down into the shop below.

A Bland Stockroom~
   This room is very small, dank, and dusty with bare, white 
brick walls completely free of any decor. There are no shelving 
units or racks for storage built into the room, instead only a 
few barrels, crates, and large wooden chests all utilitarian in 
design. A brass lantern hangs from a steel peg to one side of 
the door to offer a bit of illumination to the storeroom.

A Tree-Bordered Cul-de-Sac~
   This wide street is paved with gleaming, pristine 
   white granite and ends in a graceful curve. Elegantly pruned 
fig trees line the borders, casting ample shade over the area and 
providing home to all manner of birds who fill the air with their 
song. Narrow gutters carry away dirt and water from the area, 
keeping the street tidy and clean. A thick, decorative frame 
creates a simple, entwined circle of two strands about the 
cul-de-sac in a black and gold marble tiles.

A Liquor-Smelling Cellar~
   Lanterns hang high on the clay brick walls, creating a dim 
glow that illuminates the basement with shadows of the objects 
present casting an odd silhouette on the wall. Four sturdy 
wooden planks stand to support the upper structure of the house. 
Without the benefit of ventilation windows, the strong waft of 
liquor is lingers in the air and the smell of it so strong that 
can make one feel lightheaded just from staying too long in this 
room.
   The only means of entrance is the presence of a stone 
staircase set in the north eastern corner of the room that leads 
up to the kitchen door.

A Private Back Garden~
   A tall palm tree casts its slender shadow on the small plot of 
a private garden, planted along the side of the house. Clusters 
of flowers with different color sprawls along the side of the 
white brick wall that borders the house, and these sweet smelling 
flowers lend brightness and fragrance to the back garden. Long 
rows of flowerbeds run along the white pebbled pathway leading to 
the north from the short flight of stairs and up to the kitchen 
porch of the manor. The occasional loud noises of men and the 
clashes of two metal weapons from the north can disturb the peace 
and quiet atmosphere of this garden.

A Paved Training Yard~
   This yard is little more than an open space with faded greens 
and slightly brown lawn. The ground here has been packed hard, 
and sparse shoots of grass poke out here and there, many of them 
flat, obviously having been stepped over many times. In one 
portion of the yard, a rectangular area has been paved with small 
grey cobblestone, obviously made to be a training ground with a 
series of straw dummies standing along the edge. 
   A flat-roofed building made of adobe bricks takes up most of 
the eastern portion of the property.

The Guard Quarters~
   This square building is constructed sturdily with adobe brick. 
It has a high ceiling and flat roof, giving the room a breezy 
feel although it has been kept plain and untarnished. The only 
decoration in the room is a long, elegant banner which hangs from 
the high ceiling, sweeping down and bearing a black stallion with 
the front hoofs hung high in the air. However, the remaining 
walls have been left bare. A bronze oil lamp is bolted high on 
each corner of the wall providing light during the night. The 
entire floored is paved with smooth grey stone.

A Cobbled Entrance~
   Evenly spaced, tall, elegant palm trees rise along either side 
of the pathway, casting sparse shadow upon the cobblestones, and 
the path is wide enough to accommodate a caravan to pass through 
one at a time. The pathway continues stretching southward then 
curves east, leading to the stable entrance. And to the west and 
south is where the grassy expanses spread. In the distance to 
the south a rectangular-shaped pavement can be seen along with 
the building to the east.

white stone building with a large compartment on the eastern side 
for caravan wagons to be stored. Stalls for the horses line the 
western side of the structure and continue to the southern gate, 
which leads to the midst of a small pasture area in the back, 
allowing room for the horses to exercise and graze.

A Lush Garden Entry~
   An expanse of green foliage spreads across this area, more 
akin to a garden than the entrance to the complex beyond. Barely 
maintained as if to allow the plants an opportunity to thrive in 
wilderness, a narrow path of stepping stones leads from the gate 
towards an open courtyard to the north. Another smaller path 
pushes through trees to a tamer garden of herbs to the west. 
Most notably among these various trees and plants are a pair of 
apple trees, planted on a rise at either side of the path before 
the house. 
   Stone paths lead north and west from here, and an iron gate 
stands to the south, opening to the street beyond.

An Expansive, Open Courtyard~
   Open to the elements, this courtyard sits in the center of a 
white brick building. Poles have been set into the sunset-hued 
tile ground at equal distances, a canopy of white canvas 
providing shade across the area. A simple fountain trickles a 
small amount of water into a waiting bowl below, a collection of 
benches set in a circular pattern around the pool. A few plants 
sprout lazily in small ceramic pots and planters around the area, 
adding a touch of color. 
   Lattice doors stand north, west and east, headed into each 
wing of the house. A tiled path winds south to a lush, green 
garden beyond.

A Cheerfully Painted Kitchen~
   A cheerful, soft yellow paint coupled with a high ceiling of a 
matching hue grants a spacious, open feel to this room. A window 
set in the western wall allows sunlight in during the daytime 
hours, and another vent on the ceiling can be opened or closed to 
let out the scents that often drift about the kitchen. Sturdy 
clay brick upon the floor has been marked with soot, dirt and the 
passage of feet, tainting it a deeper brown that almost 
compliments the hue of the walls. 
   Two curtained doorways stand on the northern wall, one leading 
into a hallway and the other curling down a set of steps into the 
ground below. Thin doors detailed with intricate latticework 
lead east to the courtyard or south to a large herb garden.

A Neat, Ordered Herb Garden~
   Surrounded on two sides by a high wall made of white clay 
brick, this area of the garden has been arranged into neat rows, 
each separated by a walking path. Herbs and flowers of a wide 
array of colors and appearances sprout in the beds no matter the 
season, filling the area with the sharp, crisp aroma of growing 
plants. Vines find cracks within the mortar as footholds, 
creeping up the plot's dividing wall. 
   A latticework door serves as a side entry into the house to 
the north, while a collection of stepping stones lead towards the 
garden entry to the east.

A Jade Tiled Bedroom~
   The wide window encompassing much of the eastern wall opens up 
the well-lit room and provides a view of the outside. Matte, 
violet painted clay walls along either side of the window and 
high ceilings, give an illusion of broad space with the small 
pieces of simple furniture tucked into the corners. Jade-green 
tile floors free of dust glimmer under the light filtering 
through the heavy curtain falling down from the supports, fabric 
often fluttering under the cool breezes moving through the room. 
   A lattice door to the west leads out of the room to the 
courtyard and another to the north connects with the long 
hallway.

Haradrim Plainsman Pre-Game Shop and Set Up Area~
   Two large glass windows on the northern wall allow light to 
stream in and illuminate the room even through the thin curtains 
that drape across them. The brick walls have been painted sky 
blue, save for the beautifully detailed mural that covers the 
southern wall, testament to the steady hand of a skillful artist. 
The large ceramic tiles on the floor have been glazed to a deep 
mahogany hue, the few cracks running through them due to wear 
barely noticeable. Every available space of wall on the north, 
west and east walls has been covered in shelves, bookcases and 
cabinets. 
   Curtained doorways stand to the west and east, leading into 
darkened hallways beyond. In the center of the mural that covers 
the southern wall a latticework door opens to a covered, spacious 
courtyard.

   An expansive desert stretches in a seemingly endless pattern 
of dunes across the southern wall, broken only by the latticework 
door. Rising up in the distance is an oasis, the lush trees and 
cool glimmer of water setting a beautiful contrast of color 
against the golden yellows of the sands. Footsteps wind their 
way across the dunes, some in the process of being erased by the 
swirling wind. On the panel of the wall opposing the oasis two 
figures sit atop a black horse. Mane tossed by the wind, the 
tireless stallion's steps are confident and sturdy, the pair upon 
his back weightless. Swathed in the billowing clothing of the 
desert, midnight blue surrounds the man and lavender the woman. 
Color blossoms from their attire and the beautifully woven 
blanket and saddle upon which they sit. content to rest her head 
against the man's shoulder with her arms lovingly draped around 
his waist, the woman seems to have drifted to sleep as he guides 
the stallion onward towards the waiting respite of the oasis.

   This small, dark hallway stands unadorned and poorly lit aside 
from what light trickles in from the rooms it adjoins. The white 
brick that makes up the walls and floor has been scuffed with the 
passing of feet and time. Though it has a slight feeling of 
being cramped, echoes seem to dully reverberate from the walls as 
one moves.

thick shelves cover the northern and southern walls. Just above, 
heavy steps leading back up to the kitchen are carved into the 
bedrock. 
   The curtain over the stairs covers the doorway and serves to

   Spacious and cluttered, this large warehouse-like shop is 
filled with various displays and crates filled with weapons and 
armors. Some older displays hang from the stone brick walls, 
long collecting dust as though to testify to the age of the 
establishment. A number of small slits along the southern wall 
serve as ventilation windows, while several bronze and glass 
lanterns hang from the ceiling to cast ample lighting at all 
hours. The grey stone tile floor bears evidence of worn out 
places and cracks in some places, but remains more or less clean.

of the shop, displaying the fresh food along the white brick

wood, what little of it remains, the rest turned almost entirely

standing, save a board here or there, and that is charred almost 
all the way through.

   This is clearly the master bedroom of the house, with plenty 
of room for its occupants. A large window opens out to the 
outside on the eastern wall, letting in light during the day. 
The brick walls are painted a green in colour, the subtle shade 
evenly spread on the walls. The walls are cool to the touch, 
contrasting to the often scorching heat outside. 
   A beaded curtain, of a darker shade of green than the walls, 
leads to the living space to the south and a lace curtain leads

size, considering the bulky barrel racks that have been fixed 
upon the white brick walls. The ceiling, as with the walls, has 
been left barefaced, revealing its plain white clay brick 
construction, fortified by solid wooden beams. The floor is 
clean-swept and paved by grey stone, bearing a stain here and 
there from various liquids having been spilled. Set high along

A Warm Workroom~
   Heated by frequent brewing fires, this room is formed of 
simple clay bricks from ceiling to wall. The white clay bricks 
are clean and bear a smooth finish as from excellent masonry. 
The floor is made of thick grey stone tiles, nearly flawless in 
its mortar-less construction as each edge meets the other. Wall 
space seems to be monopolized by storage units, shelves and racks 
for the various brewing supplies, including a long, sturdy 
workbench. 
   A trapdoor leads down into the storage cellar, and a door 
against the western wall opens into the store front.

A Cool, Underground Stockroom~
   This cellar has a noted contrast when compared to the workroom 
just above it. Cool, naked clay earth forms the majority of the 
walls, although grey stone has been set along the southern sides 
as though to protect it from collecting too much moisture. The 
air itself is a bit damp. Grey stone paves the floor in large 
tiles. Various racks have been erected here with ample space to 
accommodate both large casks and small bottles.

A Gradually Widening Street~
   While the street seems to funnel into narrowing roads both 
east and west, this winding section of the road appears to have 
ample space between either side of the various shops that make 
their home here. While most of the shops are single floors, a 
few odd, smaller stores pile on a second story. The street 
itself is paved in uneven stone bricks, scuffed from time and 
stained by age-worn dirt. The hawking call of a merchant can be 
heard here from time to time, mingled with a hushed din of 
passers-by.

White Lamp Supply~
   Dimly lit, this shop front is rather spartan in appearance, 
plain grey stone making up its floor with walls and ceiling of 
white clay brick. Sturdy shelves and bins hold products of 
various sorts to display to the few customers who pass in and out 
of the store. The floor has been scratched and stained in 
places, the bare stone rough underfoot. Old netting has been 
hung on the walls in a few places, the odd tool or item hanging 
from its frayed rope, but otherwise it is merely for decoration. 
   A door has been set behind a plain counter in the far southern 
wall, leading farther into the building.

A Spartan Workroom~
   The brick walls of this basic looking storeroom have been 
coated in a now-faded whitewash, their age given away by the near 
yellow colour; smoke and the elements having taken their toll. 
The floor is roughly hewn stone, the original colour 
indeterminable, many stains and gouges marring the hard surface. 
A workbench, constructed of rough wood, has been set along the 
far wall, the bench top stained and marred in the same manner as 
the floor. The whole area is dimly lit and draughts of air find 
their way into the room from the northern and eastern doors.

A Storeroom~
   Shelves and bins have been set up here to hold various 
products in this small, simple room. The floor is dusty and made 
of roughly hewn grey stone, and the brick walls have at some time 
been coated with whitewash, long since stained yellow. Some 
shelves line the walls, hooks set underneath to hang things.

A Plain, Narrow Hallway~
   This room is only part of a longer, narrow hallway, formed of 
grey stone and mortared with white clay. The floor appears to be 
relatively clean and is paved with red-brown ceramic tiles. 
Well-tended oil lamps have been set along the wall, casting ample 
light to the area. The ceiling itself is set with a clever 
ventilation hatch, which maintains air circulation on the upper 
level. 
   A set of stairs leads up to a first floor while doors sit in 
each direction, except for the east where the hallway continues.

A Wood Crafter's Workroom~
   The plain, clean angles of this small room is plastered with a 
pale brown coat, the surface uneven but made of sound 
construction. The floor is neatly tiled with grey stone bricks 
and bears a few chips and other sides of wear, scattered with a 
perpetual layer of sawdust. The workroom is set with only the 
necessary furnishings to create an efficient workspace. Small 
windows are set along the western wall, barred with iron and 
placed very high along the wall, appearing more for the sake of 
ventilation than light or a view.

vstr Every month, you will receive an automatic supply of goods with which to craft. The materials will be left on the floor of your workroom, -only- if there are none there already. So you must keep your workroom tidy, or no new supplies will be delivered. If there are other apprentices in your trade, you will have to share work space and supplies. Please be courteous of your fellow apprentices!
vbr -
vstr When you have completed goods ready to be stocked in your master's shop, you should place it in the azure colored bin. The "senior apprentice" stationed in your workroom will deliver it to the shop for you.
vbr -
vstr Please be aware that the amount of delivered materials and your pay will not be increased with time or progression of your skill. If you find that you can now make something for which you have no supplies, then you cannot make it.

"Under Lock and Key"~
   This shop seems to be old and rundown. The clay bricks that 
comprise the wall appear to be a crumbling mess, visible even 
with the attempt of the disguise of a heavy layer of green-tinted 
plaster. The floor seems to have undergone several different 
repairs over the years as various sections of tiles cover the 
different areas, each of different shades and stages of 
weathering. Various displays of chests and locks line one wall, 
while keys have been scattered all over the front counter. 
   A poorly constructed door sits in the western doorway that 
leads outside, but its lock seems to be in pristine condition. 
Another door sits to the north, in better repair but still 
showing signs of age, its lock of similar formidable make as its 
opposite.

Field Office of the Haradrim Trade Emissary~
   With fine mason work and built from the common white stone 
this office is wide and cool. The ceiling is high and bordered 
by a turquoise geometric pattern. The walls are stark and 
austere. The floor is a plainly tiled in a muted light amber 
colored marble. A large shiny brass lantern dangles from the 
ceiling providing light in the dim cool room. A long window 
looks out upon the street and entrance to the building.

Northern Public Hallway of the Bina'Siyasa~
   Wide enough to allow two men to walk abreast, this hallway is 
tiled with highly polished black marble, faint veins of cloudy 
white marring the solid color. The walls are made of white stone 
and have been left largely unadorned. The ceiling is high enough 
only to hold a few hanging lamps without danger of them hitting a 
passer-by in the head. 
   A door to the west bears a scarlet plaque beside it, while a 
sturdy-looking door at the west side of the hallway has a 
dark-green sign.

Office of The Liaison~
   A fine intricately woven colorful carpet covers the expanse of 
lustrous black marble tiled floor. The cool white stone walls 
and high ceiling keep out the heat of the southern day while the 
unadorned walls are business like and austere. While small the 
room is large enough to be comfortable. Polished brass sconces 
are placed strategically about the room to provide bright even 
light.A velvet black banner unfurls along the southern wall, just 
beside the door, bearing the seal of Fahad'Jafari.

horse. Neat stalls are lined in a row against the far wall. A 
stack of hay is neatly ruffed and sits by bags of feed. Tack and 
tools hangs from hooks in the ceiling beams and battered copper

A Dim, Narrow Alleyway~
   Running and twisting between the back of warehouses and shops, 
this alleyway is hemmed in narrowly between these two forces. 
Overgrown with weeds and littered with trash and garbage the 
white stones are filthy and marked and grime with dirt, the hiss 
of cats and the skitter of rats punctuates the silences of the 
alley, in the background the din of Fahad Jafari floats in on the 
rancid air. To the south the alley continues to twist and turn

A Dim Winding Alleyway~
   The alley is wedged between the back of tall warehouses. 
Their height throwing the narrow walk into perpetual shade. The 
weeds are knee high and thick. Heaps of garbage and trash liter 
the way as the rustle of rats whisper from the rubble. The once 
pure white stones are filthy and covered with moss and mold. The 
city sounds drift in from the narrow path between the buildings 
as the stench rises in the small confines of passage. The alley 
continues here north and west.

A Dim Narrow Alleyway~
   This narrow stone pathway wends west and east through backs of 
warehouses and shops. Shredded bits of clothing, trash, and 
scraps of inedible food are piled off to one side, the stench 
mingling curiously with the occasional whiff of excretment. 
Shouts and noise often punctuate the air, and any gust of wind 
causes shutters to rattle. Shadowy even during the brightest 
day, this small slice of the alley is pitch dark at night-time.

A Twisting Alleyway~
   Stretching out from the east, this cramped stone pathway takes 
a sharp twist around the stone corner of a tall warehouse to the 
north populating most of this section of Fahad Jafari. Refuse 
and scraps of clothing and other less savory material is trampled 
in with the dirt, rats and mangy street animals prowling hungrily 
about in the shadows to pick at whatever a scavenging human may 
have looked over or discarded as too unpalatable. The way twists 
sharply to the north opening up between the warehouse wall and 
another shop.

A Dim Alleyway~
   This meandering alley is little more than a gap between two 
the tall warehouses, making it a slight squeeze for more than a 
couple humans to move through at a time. The stone path is made 
even more precarious by the debris littered across it, the 
obstacles varying from piles of discarded rags, midden heaps of 
stinking refuse and rotting garbage, and even street-animal 
corpses. Despite the neglect, the warehouses in this area are in 
good repair, their construction being of strong native stone; a 
reminder of the prosperity of the city. The alley continues to 
the south and east.

of buildings to the east, some loose stone and gravel sits 
beneath a large, foul smelling muckheap situated to the east, 
facing the dead-ended path. The ground underfoot is mingled dirt 
and trash, and a large stack of crates have been tossed atop a 
midden heap that is piled in the northwestern corner.

   A long snaking path of rose colored crushed stones bordered by 
masses of brightly colored flowers leads up to a wide and 
intricately carved cedar door. Decorative shrubs rest at the 
base of the large, sprawling house as flowering vines crawl 
gracefully up the white stone walls. A handful of sandalwood 
trees grace the wide lawns mixing their heady scent with that of 
the delicate flower borders.

a large ornate black iron lantern, with its four crystal sides 
carefully etched with vines and flowers. Carved cedar doors lead

A Stifling, Musky Cellar~
   Small and stifling, the air in this underground room doesn't 
move. The walls are formed of thick, mortared stone that appear 
to be constructed by a less than master hand as cracks and decay 
appear to be making its way into structure. Thick support beams 
are visible along the ceiling, propped up by brick columns. The 
floor is paved with the same stone as the walls, being drab 
shades of grey that are stained with brown spots. It is also 
badly drained so that a perpetual muddy puddle fills one corner 
where some of the bricks are missing.

boughs and offers shade beside a stone well. Exotic flowers 
border the white stone path, filling the senses with their 
intoxicating scents. Flowering shrubs are set at the base of the 
house while vines climb upwards showing their bright flowers 
along their length. The garden continues here along the length 
of the house and turns gently eastwards. Torches line the path 
throwing dim flickering light across the garden.

A Narrow Stretch of Garden~
   Continuing behind the house the quiet garden is well kept with 
beds of flowers in a riot of color. The white stone walls of the 
house allows the flowering vines to entwine upward displaying 
their colorful flowers against the white stones. Decorative 
shrubs rest at the base of the house and the crushed path 
continues to the south. The scent of jasmine wafts through the 
air.

A Quiet Rear Garden~
   This narrow stretch of garden borders the back of the house 
and terrace to the north. The grasses are well manicured and 
dotted with quaint little colorful flowerbeds surrounded and 
white stones. The rear walls of the house sport decorative 
shrubs at their base and flowering vines climbing up their white 
stone. The scent of jasmine fills the air. The crushed stone 
path, white in color leads to the west and south.

A Narrow Subterranean Passage~
   A narrow passage not much more than a crack in the city floor 
leads into the dark below. The area is filled with crumbling 
stone and brick. The damp air holds down the dust causing it to 
cling to the slippery moldy stone walls. Refuse is almost knee 
high and the stench is sickening. Little light seeps in from 
above leaving the narrow passage dank and dim.

A Dank Pocket Below The Foundation~
   Beneath the crumbling stone and stinking rubble a small rock 
pocket opens up beneath the city foundation. Quiet and still as 
a tomb the walls are damp and dripping can be heard echoing in 
some unknown crack. The floor is damp dirt marked with broken 
stones and rocks. Dust and stench from above filter into the 
dark cavern like room. The only way out is an easy climb over a 
pile of rubble to the passageway.

A Sweltering, Sandy Bloomery~
   This bloomery is situated in little more than a large, 
modified, dusty colored tent. Sand covers the floor, blown in 
from the outside through the large, open front, and has managed 
to work its way into almost every nook and cranny available. At 
the far end of the tent, a large furance stands, belching heat 
out through a pipe that exits through a hole in the canvas roof. 
   It is a busy place at almost any time of the day, with people 
using the late nights and early mornings to beat the cues of 
people.

A Well-Lit Sitting Room~
   Bearing artistic architecture, the western wall rounds out 
gracefully towards the street with tall, narrow, arching windows 
that allow fresh air and sunlight to pour in during good weather. 
The floor is paved in cobalt blue ceramic diamonds, while the 
walls have been plastered in pure white, creating a dramatic 
contrast of colors. The wooden supporting beams of the ceiling 
lay exposed against the white plaster, where a glass-encased oil 
lamp hangs from a bronze chain. The room itself has a fairly 
spacious feel. 
   An arched doorway to the east leads into the kitchen, while a 
thin, reed door has been set into the southern wall. To the 
west, a scroll worked, wooden door opens out into the rest of the 
city.

   High-set windows lie all along the eastern wall, set with 
top-hinged shutters that can be propped open at an angle on a 
pole when necessary. The ceiling is high, plastered grey as 
though to disguise any soot stains. The walls bear faint 
evidence of smoke on its green-glazed ceramic tiles, the mortar 
between them an uneven shade of grey. The floor is generally 
clean, tiled with grey stone that, while not mortared together, 
have been fitted very close together.

tiles, having no pattern whatsoever to its colorful paving. The 
walls are smoothed over with a thick coat of off-white paint. 
The southern wall and ceiling meet at a slanted angle and have 
been fitted with a row of square glass windows. A shallow alcove 
has been formed into the wall just below the windows in the shape 
of a rounded arch, painted a brilliant yellow color. 
   A thin reed door has been fitted into the doorway to the 
north, leading back into the sitting room.

   This airy room is formed into a circular shape all around, the 
walls covered in pale blue plaster, textured in uneven surface 
and shades. The floor is tiled in marbled ceramic tiles, 
swirling ivory and aquamarine together, each tile a fragmented 
shape but fitted artistically together like a shattered mosaic. 
Small, arched windows have been staggered all around, fitted with 
delicate white latticework and following the upward spiral of the 
stairs against the wall as they climb to the second floor. 
   Other than the open, encircling staircase, there is a rounded 
doorway to the west into the kitchen. A set of artistically 
painted doors sit to the south, which leads out into the city 
road.

   High-set windows lie all along the western wall, arched and 
small and fitted with white latticework. The ceiling is 
plastered grey as though to disguise any soot stains, covering 
even the wooden support beams which break the monotony of a flat 
surface. The walls have been tiled with glossy, plum colored 
ceramic tile, the mortar of which bears evidence of smoke damage, 
having an uneven shade of grey. The floor is generally clean, 
tiled with grey stone that, while not mortared together, have 
been fitted very close together.

room at the front of the house.

   A nearly circular shape, this room has only one straight wall 
to the east. The wall itself is decorated with an uneven layer 
of ecru colored plaster, covering the brick beneath it. A subtle 
checkered pattern tiles the floor with alternating shades of 
green, accented by bold yellow mortar. The spring green ceiling 
at the top rounds up into a dome, having small square glass 
windows that spiral into the center where a bronze brazier hangs. 
A tall, larger window sits in the wall along the northern side, 
arched and fitted with delicate white latticework that open out 
like a pair of curved doors, yet lead out into nothing but the 
open air. 
   Two arched doors face each other from opposite sides of the 
room, one made of woven reeds to the west, the other of plain, 
dark-stained cedar.

A Spacious Sleeping Chamber~
   The angles of this large room are very simple, with little to 
call attention to either the shape of the walls or ceiling. 
Vibrant cobalt blue tiles pave the floor, cool to the feet and 
bordered in bright white mortar. The wall is plastered with 
white, the surface smooth except where some scrollwork has been 
carved along the top and bottom borders. Key-hole arches form 
shallow alcoves on three of the four walls, each set with a 
latticed window. Cobalt tiles border the edges of the alcoves 
and the windows, offering the only splash of color on an 
otherwise plain wall. 
   Plainly fashioned cedar forms the narrow pair of arched double 
doors along the western door, its dark stain a stark contrast to 
the white plaster.

   Ample sunlight pours into this room during good daytime 
weather with credit due to the row of windows that line nearly 
the entirety of the western half of the room, having only a few 
inches of space before the next one begins. The wall curves out 
to the west, covered in a smooth white plaster and forming a room 
shaped much like a large crescent. Delicate, white latticework 
fills each of the windows with the option of a solid wooden 
shutter to block out bad weather. The floor, like the ceiling, 
have been paved in golden yellow ceramic tiles. 
   A thin door sits in the curved eastern wall, made of woven 
reeds.

   With walls that reach nearly high enough to make a second 
floor, this room is comprised of eight sides, which alternate 
between windows and doors. The four windows stretch up along the 
white plastered walls, framed in black ceramic tiles and filled 
with paned glass. The ceiling arches into a gentle point at the 
top where the support beams are visible before it blends once 
more into plaster. The floor is tiled with black marble, 
threaded with veins of creamy white. 
   A black beaded curtain fills a doorway to the north, leading 
into the kitchen, while a delicately woven reed door opens out 
into a small garden to the south. A pair of darkly stained doors 
sits opposite of each other, the one to the east leading to the 
city street.

which allow for plenty of light to pour in during good weather.

pillars sit at regular intervals and at each corner, bearing 
naked wooden beams, which in turn seem to form large, open 
windows. Fine, airy netting covers the entire expanse of the 
outdoor space, casting shadows over the white brick that form the 
patio. Bared earth and raised planters form the beds of the 
various plants that all meld fluidly into the center where a 
raised stone wall encircles a generous plot of earth.

each diamond shaped tile. The walls are coated in an uneven 
layer of pale ivory plaster and form a spacious room. The 
corners are rounded out except for the western wall, where it 
forms an angular alcove for the bed. The alcove is covered by a 
slanted part of ceiling, glass windows comprising an overhead 
view of the sky. The rest of the ceiling reveals deep blue tiles 
and vaulted pale wooden support beams.

   Threaded by a gravel walkway down the center, this courtyard 
is best described as picturesque. A few trees grow along the 
sides of the path, their branches entangled overhead to form a 
broken arbor. Small hanging lanterns swing from the thicker 
branches to cast light along the path at night. Beyond the 
gravel road, the courtyard is host to a few small flower beds, 
the fragrance wafting heavily in the area when in the height of 
its blooming seasons. 
   A plain wrought-iron gate separates the courtyard from the 
city road to the south, while a wooden door with a rounded top 
opens into the small house to the north.

   Set upon multiple levels, this room appears to be 
multifunctional. The wall all around has plaster covering its 
brick foundation in a textured layer of white. The ceiling is 
likewise coated except where the wooden supports show through. 
The main of the room is paved in tiny, multi-colored ceramic 
tiles and serves as a sitting room. A kitchen area rests along 
the northeastern corner, sunken a little lower than the ground 
level. Plain grey stone paves the floor there until it leads up 
into a set of two short steps of what must be a white-tiled 
dining section. Two rows of small square windows line the 
northern and southern walls uniformly. 
   While the southern door with a round top leads into the 
courtyard outside, another door opens to the west, made of thick, 
woven reed.

   Large, earthy red ceramic tiles cover the floor of this room, 
simply shaped squares throughout. The tiles fade up into the 
wall, obvious great care having been taken to give it the 
appearance of flowing and fading upward. An extensive mural 
covers the rest of the room, from the wall and extending even up 
into the ceiling. It depicts a wild oasis scene with a small 
grove of cedar trees to the south and the sun shining from the 
ceiling. From the sun, randomly angled, triangular glass windows 
seem to radiate away and settle primarily along the upper half of 
the western wall. While these are the only windows, there seems 
to be no loss of light during the day, sunsets being especially 
spectacular.

To Skin a Cat Leathercrafts~
   Filled with the distinct scent of tanned and curing leather, 
this shop is built higher than the rest of the souk in a plain 
attempt to allow the fumes to escape into the breeze before 
reaching the ground level. Ample windows line each of the white 
brick walls, save for the eastern one, iron bars closing them off 
from intruders and removable shutters available for inclement 
weather. The floor is paved with rectangular golden tiles, swept 
often. The ceiling is slightly domed, vaulted by gracefully 
curving wooden support beams, which bears a hanging lamp from its 
center. 
   Opening out into a small landing which leads to the stairs, a 
large doorway lies host to a thick, worn door, carved with the 
likeness of a full-maned lion. To the east, a plain white door 
leads into the backrooms.

A Foul Smelling Workroom~
   Practically an open-air work area, all attempts have been made 
to give the room as much aeration as possible. Large, wide 
windows rest within the northern and eastern walls, shielded from 
the elements by top-hinged shutters that swing outward, casting 
shade in the sun or closing the windows during storms. 
Unfortunately, in an unlucky wind, the smoke from the forge below 
blows in on occasion. The plastered walls are a hazy grey color, 
likely from time worn smoke and tanning fumes. The ceiling is 
straight and untouched, leaving the brick work and wooden beams 
exposed. The floor is tiled in plain grey stone, kept mostly 
clean. 
   A white door to the west opens into the storefront, while a 
narrow door leads into a storage room.

from the very plaster, often more potent during warmer days. The 
floor is neatly tiled with grey stone bricks. The workroom is 
set with only the necessary furnishings to create an efficient 
workspace. Long windows are set along the southern wall, barred 
with iron and placed very high along the wall, appearing more for 
the sake of ventilation than light or a view.

vstr Every month, you will receive an automatic supply of goods with which to craft. The materials will be left on the floor of your workroom, -only- if there are none there already. So you must keep your workroom tidy, or no new supplies will be delivered. If there are other apprentices in your trade, you will have to share work space and supplies. Please be courteous of your fellow apprentices!
vbr -
vstr When you have completed goods ready to be stocked in your master's shop, you should place it in the azure colored bin. The "senior apprentice" stationed in your workroom will deliver it to the shop for you.
vbr -
vstr Please be aware that the amount of delivered materials and your pay will not be increased with time or progression of your skill. If you find that you can now make something for which you have no supplies, then you cannot make it.

A Broad Tent Smelling of Fruit~
   The western most side of this long, canvas tent houses a place 
for several crates and baskets. The floor is covered with 
thickly woven rugs, many of an elaborate design although showing 
their misuse by time and spills. The sweet scent of fruit fills 
the air here, wafting from the bountiful display of fruits, 
berries, and nuts that fill their different containers. The 
sound of bartered prices add to the din.

A Broad Tent Selling Dry Goods~
   The sturdy canvas roof and walls of this large tent are 
supported by wooden poles, harboring the edible goods within from 
the ravaging of the elements. Woven straw mats blanket the 
floor, catching spills left by the various dry goods set out on 
display. Baskets, jars, and barrels have been stacked along the 
southern wall, while the looser goods hold to a prominent place 
at the forefront. The constant buzz of customers' voices fills 
the air, broken only occasional shout of a deal well struck or of 
one gone awry. 
   A tent flap hangs to the north, exiting back into the souk.

A Broad Tent Displaying Fresh Meat~
   The strong smell of blood and livestock assaults the senses on 
this side of the wide tent, marking the wares before one can even 
look down at the various cuts of meat spread out on display. 
Several layers of thick canvas mats pad the floor, each stained 
with telltale splotches of browns and reds. In the farthest 
corner, a large stone slab has been set up for butchering the 
animals then and there. A few young, dark-skinned children 
circulate among the meat with palm fronds, swatting and shooing 
at flies that have been drawn by the musky smell of livestock.

A Secluded Garden Enclosed By Tall Hedges And Brick Wall~
   Tall green hedges encircle this exotic garden, built along two 
sides of the courtyards brightly bricked walls. A small gazebo, 
painted white, has been built in the center of the garden, 
surrounding by plots of flowers and shrubs, leaded up to by a 
path of white stone. The trail forks off to also lead to a bench 
that is covered by an awning, nestled up against the hedge wall 
in the cool shade. Drifting in the air from yellow-painted poles 
is a trio of white gauze banners, high above the hedges and the 
few cypress trees dotting the landscape. In one corner of the 
garden white slabs of stone have been laid to form a square of 
firm ground. Brass lamps are hung from a few smaller poles to 
cast light about the area when it is dark outside.

smooth sandalwood lead out of the building to the west, and a 
small stone bench rests to one side of the entry alcove. The 
center of the hall has been sunken by a few steps from all sides 
to form a sitting area, four pillars of white stone set at each 
corner to supplant the sky-blue painted ceiling. Tall windows of 
opaque stained glass are recessed in the light yellow painted 
plaster walls, splashing the marble floor with bright blobs of 
light in a variety of colours when it is bright outside. A 
hallway branches off to the east through a peaked archway, the 
walls to both sides adorned with murals depicting all sorts of 
parchments, quills, and bottles on ink. Thin gauze banners, dyed 
white, hang from the ceiling in places, wafting whenever a breeze 
drifts through the hall. Ingeniously crafted doors of thick 
glass have been set in the eastern hall, swinging outwards when 
pushed, to lead out onto a covered terrace and garden. Other 
archways, wider than the others and with wide painted doors are 
set in the northern and southern wall, leading further into the 
building. Elegant lamps of bronze adorn the walls to cast a dim 
lighting when it is dark outside.

An Elegant Dining Room With A Vaulted Ceiling~
   Tall windows of stained glass continue on from the entry hall 
into this dining room, set with stained wood ledges along the 
northern wall. The floor has been laid in solid cobalt-blue 
marble tile, shiny gold and silver flecks streaking its surface. 
Vibrant yellow paint covers the plaster walls on all four sides 
of this room, artistic murals displaying all the implements of 
feasting and joyous celebration masterfully painted on the 
western southern wall. A wooden blue painted blue is hung in the 
southern wall, pots and pans depicted in the mural surrounding 
its frame. The ceiling in the room is vaulted, painted a blue to 
match the floor. Ornate sconces of bronze, bearing torches, are 
hung upon the walls at appropriate intervals to provide a 
flickering light. Gauzy white curtains hang over each of the 
windows, away from the sconces, fabric limp unless a breeze 
passes through the room.

A Long Marble-Tiled Antechamber~
   Banners of white gauzy fabric line the ceiling from corner to 
corner, crossing in the middle, in this long rectangular 
antechamber. The same cobalt blue and white patterned marble 
tile is laid in this room as in the antechamber, with tall glass 
windows and bronze lamps lining the western wall to brighten the 
room. The walls are coated with a creamy yellow paint over the 
textured plaster, and the ceiling is white and pebbly. A small 
area of the room has been sunken, surrounded by a single step on 
three sides, along the wall with the windows to provide a sitting 
area. A smooth wooden door painted to match the cobalt tile has 
been hung in the southern wall with shiny brass hinges. A mural 
of writing implements, scrolls and tomes has been artfully 
painted on the wall around the quill-carved double-doors, which 
are stained a rich hue and made of mahogany.

A Roomy, Vented Kitchen~
   Clear windows that have been set in the ceiling, opened by 
pulleys from below, can be opened and closed to vent this 
brightly lit kitchen. A corner of the room is dominated by a 
stone cistern, fresh water glistening from within its confines. 
Cabinets line the side of the northern wall, save for a carved 
door that leads into a walk-in pantry. In the corner opposite of 
the cistern is an iron-handled trap doors, granite steps heading 
down into a dark and cool cellar. Smoothed slate makes up the 
kitchen floor, providing a footing even when wet, and a basin has 
been built below some meat hooks. A door of louvered wooden 
slats leads further to the east, hinged with shiny bright brass. 
Along the eastern wall is a line of benches, a large stove, 
counters, and hooks to hang utensils upon. A yellow paint has 
been washed over the walls and ceiling, and iron sconces hang 
upon the wall, to brighten up the kitchen.

of heights. The floor is of stone slabs, and there is enough 
room in the pantry for a person to comfortably stand. The walls

stained-glass windows built into it to stream down light in a 
variety of colours when it is bright outside. Dark-stained 
hardwood comprises the floor in the room, set in long and narrow 
pieces, with barely a scratch marring the polished surface. Tall 
bookshelves of dark wood run side by side to line the eastern 
wall, spaced only for a narrow window of clear glass that 
overlooks a garden on the outside. A gauzy curtain of white 
fabric hangs on a shiny brass rod over the window. A plentiful 
amount of bronze lamps hang upon the forest green painted walls 
to cast adequate lighting when it is dark outside. A trio of 
steps, with a brassy-railed banister upon each side for support 
lead up to a small landing. An ebon painted door of smooth wood 
is hung in the wall with brass hinges, accessible from the raised 
landing.

A Connecting, Awning-Covered Terrace Surrounded By Gardens~
   A wide awning of pure-white dyed cloth covers the raised 
terrace that connects a smaller building surrounded by gardens to 
the main manor, shading it from the light and keeping the 
cobalt-blue tile cool to the touch. The terrace is lined with a 
carved granite banister, and has granite steps on both sides to 
lead down into a luxurious garden. Awnings of white cloth 
provide shade in the gardens, and tall hedges and cypress trees 
dot the lush grass. In the shady spots of the garden, provided 
by the awnings, or tucked away in privacy in the shelter of trees 
and bushes, are benches to provide a seat to those inclined. At 
the southern end of the terrace, leading into the main manor, is 
an ingeniously hinged set of swinging doors comprised of 
thick-paned glass. A few steps lead up from the terrace to the 
flower carved sandalwood doors the give entry to the vine-covered 
smaller building.

through it. Elegant white marble tile has been set to make up 
the floor, and the walls have been thickly coated with a vibrant 
dark blue paint. Elaborate murals of garden scenery have been

the plaster walls, depicting bounteous exotic fauna and flowers. 
Wide clear paned windows may be opened or closed to allow more 
air into the dwelling, and allow an easy view outside onto the 
beautiful gardens. The ceiling is hung with gauzy white banners 
that cross over each other at the middle and drift with the 
movement of air. Upon the each wall a cast bronze lamp has been

this beautiful private garden. A small water fountain trickles 
in one corner, a sunburst mosaic of tile bordered by a layout of 
bright flowers surrounding it. Vines bearing colourful blooms 
crawl over the blue-tiled ground of the garden and the bordering 
flowers thrive and give off fragrant scent. Gauzy white cloth 
hangs from a pair of poles to provide a shady canopy over a bench 
that looks onto the fountain, and an awning of the same white has 
been hung over the archway that leads back into the airy 
building. A few small cypress and fig trees dot the small

bench to one side, and the blooms of some of the plants it 
contains. A small awning of white cloth has been arranged over 
the curtained entry into the building, fending off rain and wind. 
A few slabs of plain stone have been laid under the small bench, 
shaded unless around mid-day by the tall hedges it is placed 
near. The same plain stone rings the small gardens centered in 
the enclosed area. A single brass single hangs from a ring aside 
the curtain to cast a dim light over the area when it is dark. A 
single fig tree grows in the garden.

harmonies and captivating melodies to form a warm and soothing 
environment.

windows cover the eastern wall, relieving most of the heat that 
radiates from the large stove nestled into the far corner and the 
large oven built into the southern wall. Dried flowers have been 
woven into wreathes along with cloves, cinnamon and ginger that

Their subtle, spicy scent mingles pleasantly with the cloying 
scent of honey and fresh fruit in the wicker basket that has been

   Thick, woven carpets with intricate and colorful embroidered 
motifs are piled in layers to cushion one's footsteps. The walls 
have plasterwork covers and are painted in a soothing neutral 
color of the sand. The ceiling is studded with mosaics of 
complicated patterns of flower trellises. An oversized brass 
chandelier hangs in the center of the room, providing the chamber 
with a soft luminescence. A beautiful, latticed window in the 
similar floral motifs as the ceiling stream the natural light and 
air, filling the room with a fresh sweet orange scent from the 
garden.

screen, patterned with intertwining leafy tendrils in place of 
curtains. The eastern far corner of the room is clearly set 
aside for bathing purposes, and another for grooming. The floor 
is covered with bright ceramic tiles, and most of the walls are 
white brick and kept bare. A brass candelabrum hangs in the 
center of the room, holding some many score tapers that brighten 
it.

Well-Kept Bedroom~
   Evenly placed bricks form this square room, the walls 
plastered and painted a light green color. Hardwood of dark, 
slightly reddish brown covers the entire floor, contrasting well 
with the color of the walls. During the day, the room is 
brightly lit, the sunlight shining through the two windows placed 
into the northern wall. The windows are arched at the top, with 
white wooden frames. Each window consists of eight clear glass 
panels, separated by wooden framing, offering a limited view 
outside the room. Twin, white painted lanterns hang from the 
ceiling in the middle of the room. They are identical, with 
domed tops and pentagonal shapes. The door of the room is set 
into the west-end of the southern wall, made of solid plain oak 
and set with a sturdy lock.

A Bedroom with a Vibrant Canopy~
   It's a spacious room with the floor composed of brightly 
colored mosaic tiles of cobalt blue. Thin, fuchsia-colored gauze 
fabrics flow down from the center of the high domed ceiling, 
stapled to the top edge of the wall and cascading down to the 
floor and puddle. The only light source is the light from the 
flame of candles that illuminates elegantly and each shielded 
inside a small globe of colored glass.

A Jeweler's Workroom~
   The plain, clean angles of this small room is plastered with 
an ivory coat, the surface uneven but made of sound construction. 
The floor is neatly tiled with grey stone bricks and bears a few 
chips and other sides of wear. The workroom is set with only the 
necessary furnishings to create an efficient workspace. Small 
windows are set along the southern and eastern walls, barred with 
iron and placed very high along the wall, appearing more for the 
sake of ventilation than light or a view.

vstr Every month, you will receive an automatic supply of goods with which to craft. The materials will be left on the floor of your workroom, -only- if there are none there already. So you must keep your workroom tidy, or no new supplies will be delivered. If there are other apprentices in your trade, you will have to share work space and supplies. Please be courteous of your fellow apprentices!
vbr -
vstr When you have completed goods ready to be stocked in your master's shop, you should place it in the azure colored bin. The "senior apprentice" stationed in your workroom will deliver it to the shop for you.
vbr -
vstr Please be aware that the amount of delivered materials and your pay will not be increased with time or progression of your skill. If you find that you can now make something for which you have no supplies, then you cannot make it.

A Small Private Salon~
   This tiny luxurious salon at the rear of the main cabin is 
just big enough for bed and pillows for the floor. Two small 
windows on either side of the salon are draped in midnight blue, 
wispy silk curtains allowing Anor to smile her golden glow 
through its dark filter keeping the room cool. The cool breeze 
blowing off the river refreshes the air and billows the silk with 
every breathe. 
   Wispy midnight blue silk curtains drape a narrow doorway

The Blocked End of a Hallway~
   The eastern end of this stone hallway has collapsed, large 
stone blocks cutting off any chance of moving in that direction. 
The rest of the passage seems solid, though the elaborately laid 
stonework is covered in mould and dampness and the air is fetid. 
Under the dark of the mouldy walls a mural can be seen, depicting 
a banquet with dark-skinned men and women sitting about a long 
table laden with meat. The stone tiles underfoot are damp and 
slightly slippery, and a puddle has formed below a ladder on the 
southern wall, dripping into the cracks of the floor at the same 
slow rate that water drips down from above.

A Breezy Rooftop Patio~
   Broad steps hewn of golden-flecked stone lead up the side of 
the house to a broad rooftop patio. A low white wall follows the 
stairs and then curves around the edge, with decorative diamond 
cut outs to let through light and air. The patio itself is 
covered in brilliant cobalt ceramic floor tiles cut into 
interlocking geometric shapes, carefully fitted together. A 
thick awning of bright purple spans all but the corner of the 
patio near the stairs, scalloped overhang fluttering at the 
slightest breeze. From the center of the awning, where the 
supporting poles come together, hangs an elaborate lantern of 
punched brass. A curving stone stair leads down to the court.

A Quaint, Tidy Shop~
   Overlooking the streets of the industrial district below 
through a pair of arched, muslin-curtained windows, this small, 
well appointed shopfront is airy and bright. Simple in it's 
layout, boasting only a small counter and a few items displayed 
along the shelved plaster walls, the area is offered warmth by 
the umber hues of the tiles underfoot. Beyond the counter, a 
single door leads off elsewhere, while a curtained doorway 
returns to the stairs outside.

breeze. The tiled floor bespeaks functionality over decor, 
though the burnished hues do lend a warmth to the room. A small

Qeb'Meti Armor~
   Constructed of white clay bricks like most of the buildings in 
this vicinity, the front room of this shop is spacious enough to 
handle several customers and additional browsers while still 
maintaining displays of the goods available for purchase. There 
are several wooden beams in the ceiling for support but other 
than that, the shop relies much on it's goods for decoration. 
There are shelves behind the counter for various smaller items, 
and racks throughout the place displaying full suits of armor for 
sale. The musky scent of leather and the sharp smell of hot 
metal pervade the area and every now and then you can hear a 
loud, heavy repeated clanging of metal on metal coming from the 
backroom. Lighting is maintained by two central lamps hanging 
near the center of the room as well as another one behind the 
counter. An entrance covered by a white curtain leads back out 
onto the street to the north. while a thick door with a heavy 
lock leads off behind the counter southwards.

and shelves lining the walls. Various other containers are

white- brick that make up the rest of the building and except for 
the shelves are entirely bare. There is an empty look to this 
room even though it is filled with materials, tools, and other 
things of such. A single lantern hangs in the room closer from 
the center to where the workbench is in the northwestern corner 
of the room. A thick door with a heavy lock leads into the north 
while a black curtained doorway leads out to the west to 
somewhere outside.

A Dimly-Lit Shack~
   The plain, pine walls of this shack are built much better on 
the inside than the appearance of the outside give credit for. 
Very few cracks appear to be visible in the wooden beams, and the 
area of the room is very spacious. Off-tilt on the outside, the 
floor on the inside is perfectly level. Someone with keen eyes 
might be able to make out a square inlaid into the center of the 
floor. The room offers no windows, and has a single lantern 
hanging by a chain that reaches down from the center of the 
ceiling. A strong, pine door is imbedded into the eastern wall, 
a wooden beam near to bolt it shut.

A Spacious, Mural-Painted Entrance Hall~
   This entrance hall is wide and spacious, appearing luxurious 
without being decadent. Made airy by it's simple design, and 
light by the large screen door, and numerous windows, that open 
onto a large, internal garden. The floors are covered with soft, 
thick, reed mats, providing comfort, as well as muffling the 
noise of any footsteps. The walls themselves are formed of 
wooden screens, and are painted a soft, off-white colour. Upon 
them has been painted a stylised mural of a river, bordered by 
many willow trees in which a great variety of birds have come to 
nest. Painted in subdued tones of black and blue, it lends an 
air of decoration to the spartan room, without appearing 
frivolous.

   Leading off from the wide hallway to the east, the walls of 
this room are decorated with a serene mural of an endless, grassy 
plain. Painted with great artistry the swaying of the grass and 
trees in the breeze, can be discerned, as well as several 
feathers and flower blossoms, drifting along on some unseen 
current. The floor of this room are covered in thick, soft reed 
matting that provides comfort underfoot as well as creating a 
muffling of sound that adds to the air of serenity here. To the 
east, a door leads back into the entrance hallway, while a large 
dining room is visible to the north.

   Although filled with light by the screen door and many windows 
in the the eastern wall that provide a commanding view of the 
internal garden, this room is given a certain degree of sobriety 
in it's decor. The floor is covered by soft, thick reed mats, 
softening footsteps and providing comfort underfoot. The wooden 
walls themselves have been painted black, and lacquered to a high 
shine, upon them is painted a mural in red, decorative, though 
sparse enough to seem unfussy, of lotus flowers in bloom, gazing 
toward some unseen sky.

circulates through the curtained doorway to the south, while 
several windows allow the scent of the flowers that grow in the 
garden outside to waft inside. The walls and floor of this room 
are built from white marble, which keeps it cool at all hours. 
Several beds and other assorted furniture are set about this 
area, and music can often be heard drifting in from the south.

A Mural Painted Sitting Room~
   Leading off from the wide hallway to the west, the most 
notable feature of this room is the murals that decorate the 
wooden screening that comprises it's walls. Painted on a soft, 
off-white background in the manner of an orchard in the height of 
spring, trees laden with bloosom adorn every spare inch of 
wallspace, the petals that flutter towards the ground seeming 
practically real, such is their artistry. The floors of this 
room are covered in thick, soft reed matting that provides 
comfort underfoot as well as creating the muffling of sound that 
adds an air of calm. To the west, a door leads back into the 
entrance hallway, while a large, empty room is visible to the

bedroom is spacious, natural light flooding in from the archway 
in the rooms northern wall, the sheer curtain that hangs there 
offering it little obstruction. While the room is simple and 
clean in it's design, the expense of it's construction is shown 
in the wooden walls, painted a soft yellow, upon which a swirling 
abstract mural has been painted, giving the room a warm, yet 
relaxed atmosphere. The floor is covered in soft, thick reed 
matting, providing a further touch of luxury, as well as comfort 
underfoot.

   Surrounded on three sides by the house, the centrepiece of 
this garden is a large pond, filled with ornamental fish, and 
bordered by iris plants. About the edges of the garden jasmine 
climbs the walls of the house while the centre is composed of a 
manicured lawn interspersed liberally with carefully sculpted, 
flowering shrubs and trees. A path of granite stepping stones 
winds it's way lazily through the garden, to the edge of the 
pond, where a bridge leads to a small pavilion.

   A corridor runs off in two directions at the top of a wide 
flight of stairs, each ending with a sliding screen door. The 
ceiling here is high, and tall windows mean that the area is 
bathed in light during the day. The walls are panelled in wood, 
the murals common to the rest of the residece not lacking here, 
an exquisite river, running through an orchard of blossoming 
trees which deposit their blooms into the water, where they are 
carried gently away, being depicted. The floors are covered in 
the same reed matting as the rest of the house, and an atmosphere 
of unfrivolous calm abounds.

a pond filled with large, ornamental fish, this pavilion is given 
a secluded feeling by the jasmine that climbs thickly upon it, 
though still allowing a view of the rest of the garden through 
it's creeping vines. Intimate in size, and filled with the scent 
of the flowers from the garden, the building itself is 
constructed entirely of wood, it is decoratively carved with 
images of dancing women, and varnished to a high shine, 
protecting it against the elements.

   In contrast to much of the rest of the house, the floor of 
this room is not covered with reed matting, but of wood, 
varnished and polished to give a high shine and a smooth surface. 
The room is especially light and airy, as a large part of it's 
western wall is given over to a series of large windows and a 
screen door which look out onto a manicured, internal garden. 
The screen walls themselves are painted a shade of bright red, 
with a mural of large jasmine flowers blooming on a single, long 
vine, snaking it's way around the room in gold paint. But aside 
from that, the room is largely empty.

   This sturdy, well-built, scarlet tent spreads widely across 
the marketplace. Several logs have been used on each corner of 
the tent to act as pillars. The aroma of fresh dairy farm 
products such as cheese fill the air of this tent. A few 
lanterns have been hung from the ceiling of this large tent to 
provide a source of light. A few barrels and crates, filled with 
farm goods have been stacked neatly at the eastern side of the 
tent.

set of bars high in the southern wall, while elsewhere is left to

The shadow lined wall appear to be formed of solid stone, its

Several servants wander about in an ever constant battle to keep 
the serpent depicting mosaic tiles clear of the dust, debris and 
manure that seems ever present. Set adjacent to a well by the 
high western wall are a number of stone water troughs meant to 
care for any caravan beasts that come to rest here. On the far 
side of the well, a large, L shaped building fills two corners of 
the market. The northern edge of the building boasts a high roof 
and broad walls, giving hint to the sizable dimensions of the 
warehouse within, while to the east the short leg of the L shaped 
building slims and narrows to provide a still sizable meeting 
hall.

   Well dressed merchants and younger workers alike mill about 
this open expansed building. Formed from a wing of the 
warehouse, the room's structure itself is unimpressive and 
utilitarian with a solid floor and bare beams showing above, but 
its fine furnishings and wall dressings do much to cover up this 
fact. A set of broad double doors lie to the west, granting 
access out to the wagonyard, while a smaller door to the north 
leads to a tiny office set in the corner.

towards the slums. Coming from this direction is a slight smell 
of rubbish, refuse and waste, growing stronger as one moves 
northwards. The area about you, however, has been kept fairly 
free of rubbish, what remains having been piled up on the western 
wall of the path, where rats and vermin forage amongst it for 
food and shelter. Dark-skinned men and women make their way both 
north and south, most barely speaking to each other as they pass.

A Crossroads In The Alley~
   This crossroads has been formed here by the merging of four 
very similiar alleys, each bordered by rubbish and ramshackle 
shanties, each one pointing off in a different direction. Whilst 
the alleys are in no way wide the one leading south is certainly 
the widest of the four, and seems to widen still as it continues 
onwards. Leading north, east and west the other three alleyways 
slink away, the stench which permeates the crossroads only 
deepening as one heads further into the slums.

A Narrow-Lit Alleyway~
   This narrow alleyway leads northwards towards the slums here, 
the smell of rubbish increasing as one travels that way. This 
area has been kept free from such rubbish, though the occasional 
rat can still be seen or heard, most following their noses 
northwards.A decrepit house stands at the southern end of the 
pathway, blocking off any movement in that direction.

A Widened Alleyway~
   The alley widens here as it moves northwards, also branching 
off to the west. A slight smell of refuse, rubbish and waste is 
present here, slowly coming down from the north. The area itself 
has been kept fairly free of such and what remains has been 
pushed off to the side by traffic. The dark-skinned humans of 
this area are not this path's only traffic either, vermin seen 
making their way north in the shadows of the eastern wall, 
squeeking and squeeling as they move.

Entering the Slums~
   The way into the slums opens up here to the east, though 
alleys lead of in every direction. The pathways are not too 
crude, and have been cleared of most rubbish but the smell of 
refuse still fills the air and rats can be heard amongst what 
waste is on the streets. To the east the shanty town begins, the 
shacks looking unsturdy even from this distance, people coming 
and going in every direction.

Entrance of the Slums~
   The alley leading east to west here narrows sharply as it 
skips between shanties and shacks, snaking along now with no 
particular direction obvious, merely the dodging of hodgepodge 
housing. Rubbish and debris has been piled up against the walls 
of these shacks, in some cases being used as support and 
insulation, vermin and rodents scurrying openly across the waste. 
A stench of combined waste permeates the area, laying stagnant in 
the air.

Southern Corner of the Slums~
   A large stone wall covering the entire southern side of this 
area dominates the area, playing host to an almost-six-foot stack 
of debris, rubbish and waste. Shanties and shacks dot the area, 
some using the stone wall as their own structure, others just 
built in the more typical makeshift manner of this area. Few 
people travel through this snaking path as it leads north and 
east, those that do keeping to the shadows and darker paths, 
cautious of the rodents nesting in the rubbish piles.

Passing through the Slums~
   A large stone wall towers up on the western side of this 
portion of the slums, rubbish piled often as high as six feet. 
The path winds narrowly between the shacks and shanties that have 
been set up here, each one just as bad as the other; all of them 
made from scraps and debris. Rats and other rodents seem to be 
the main traffic in this area, scurrying from the top of the wall 
down to the rubbish piles, and across the path, most human 
traffic moving through the shadows and keeping to themselves.

Moving Past A Shack~
   The alley snakes in from the north here and continues its ever 
winding path both east and south, curving around makeshift 
shanties and shacks which have clearly been laid out with no plan 
in mind. The shanties are all made up of a huge variety of 
materials, ranging from sheet iron to plywood, a lot using bricks 
from the western wall. Refuse piles against this wall, almost to 
the very top, and rodents can be seen scurrying about looking for 
food and nesting, with no care for the scant human traffic. A 
disgusting smell of rotten food and human waste premeates the 
stagnant air here.

A Snaking Alley in the Slums~
   This snaking alley twists and turns at nearly every possible 
moment, dodging past shacks and shanties clearly laid out with no 
plan in mind. The shanties are all made up of hodgepodge 
materials, ranging from sheet iron to plywood, some even using 
bricks from the western wall. Rubbish piles against this wall, 
almost to the very top, and rats can be seen scurrying about in a 
fervour looking for food and nesting, with no care for the scant 
human traffic. A disgusting smell of rotten food and human waste 
premeates the stagnant air here.

In the Midst of the Slums~
   Practically in the centre of the west-side slums this small 
area has been kept relatively tidy, most of the rubbish piled to 
the east. A few traders mill in this area in the hope of making 
a sale, rats keeping a close eye on those merchants selling food, 
but keeping their distance from the traffic moving to and from 
the north and south. The smell of trash wafts in from the east, 
mixing with the stench of human sweat and the general odour of 
the slums. The alley here is relatively wide, snaking past the 
shacks which define its course.

Snaking Between the Shacks~
   Haphazardly formed by the placement of shacks this alley 
snakes along, debris and rubbish scattered across the ground. 
The path darkens as it heads south, moving right into the heart 
of the slums. Few people can be seen outside of their shacks, 
those that can be move along in the shadows, their voices low, 
eyes darting about. Rodents can be seen moving in and out of the 
rubbish, a few brave rats scurrying around on the main path. The 
stench of human waste, sweat and rubbish fills the area.

Moving Through the Slums~
   Shacks and shanties have been built up here from an assortment 
of rubble and unwanted materials, from timber to metal, all of 
the pieces thrown together in a hodgepodge manner. The placement 
of these shacks and shanties is the only thing which designs the 
course of the alley which slinks through the area. Rubbish, from 
human waste to pieces of shanties, covers the ground here rats 
and other vermin seen openly climbing over and around the debris. 
A stench permeates through the entire area and few people can be 
seen moving along the path.

Northwestern corner of the Slums~
   The slums come to an abrupt end here, large stone walls rising 
up to the north and west, rubbish piling up on their rugged 
surface. A small ledge can be seen at the top of the wall, 
nothing but a slight overhang of the neighbouring building's 
roof. The area stinks of vermin and rubbish, no single smell 
discernable but the combination of them disgustingly 
overpowering. Shacks and shanties line the walls between the 
piles of rubbish, some using the debris as a wall.

falling off, seems barely more stable than some of the shanties 
which dot the area in a haphazard pattern a small ledge seen at 
the very top. Rubbish and refuse pile to almost knee height in 
some places throughout the area, vermin seen foraging in and atop 
the masses of waste. The air sits stagnant, a heavy stink of 
rubbish permeating the area. Few people can be seen travelling, 
those that do keeping to the shadow of the wall.

Shadowy, Trash-Ridden Slums~
   A large stone wall rises up to the east here, blocking any 
movement in that direction and the morning sun. Shadows are cast 
across the area throughout the day and it is almost pitch-black 
at night. The squeels of rats can be heard as they forage and 
fight for food left in the huge piles of rubbish which dominate 
this area, mobs of rats scurrying over piles of rubbish and paths 
alike, no heed to the little human traffic that may pass through.

A Darkened Alleyway~
   This alley has been haphazardly formed by the placement of 
wooden shanties and shacks, widening to the east as it turns into 
a properly formed road. Rubbish and debris fill the area, the 
only clear ground turned into a slight track, rats and other 
vermin darting across this trail ahead of you. A stagnant stench 
permeates the area, a mixture of human waste, rubbish and 
rodents. Not many people make their way through here, those that 
can be seen all keeping to the shadows, their demeanour cautious.

A Trash-Ridden Alley~
   The eastern direction here is blocked by a pile of wood, sheet 
iron and crumbling mortar, though a path still leads to the 
debris, as though it was once a shack or makeshift house. 
Rubbish has been piled over this entire area, even the paths 
leading north, south and west covered in knee-high trash. Rats 
and vermin of every sort scurry about in abundance, obviously 
attracted by the horrific smell of human waste, rotten food and 
rubbish that wafts throughout this alley. Movement through the 
trash here is hard and human traffic rare, most avoiding the 
squallor.

Snaking Alley Past a Shack~
   This part of the slums has been kept relatively tidy and 
traffic passes north and south, many also frequenting the eastern 
den. Smoke wafts slowly out from under the eastern door, through 
gaps when it is closed and in even larger billows when the door 
is open. The sweet smell of this smoke competes half-heartedly 
with the stench of the rubbish which stacks on the side of 
buildings, rats crawling over the waste in search of food and 
nesting. The shacks in this area are even of a slightly better 
quality than the rest of the slums, made of sheet-iron and not 
swaying with every gust of wind.

An Alley through the Slums~
   The pathway breaks off to move to the west here, passage 
eastwards blocked by a pile of crumbling bricks, mortar and sheet 
iron. Shacks have formed atop and around this pile, most of them 
using it as a weak foundation or wall. Rubbish piles coming to 
knee height have formed either side of the curving path, though 
the alley itself is kept relatively tidy. Rats squeek and scurry 
in the bordering refuse piles, occasionally darting out in front 
of passersby.

Passing by a Makeshift Shack~
   Four twisting paths snake through this part of the slums, 
formed solely by the placement of the shacks and shanties in the 
area, with no apparent course in mind. The shacks, huts and 
other make-shift abodes have all been put together with a large 
assortment of materials, from sheet iron to plywood; all of it 
debris and waste. Rubbish lines the ground between these shacks 
and, in some cases, even atop the houses. Rats can be seen and 
heard as they scurry and squeek their way through, foraging for a 
meal.

Before a Delapitated Shop~
   The area in front of the shop here has been kept relatively 
tidy of the piles of rubbish typical to these slums, though small 
piles are present where they have been pushed away from the 
regular foot traffic. The smell of the slums continues here, 
though the smell of rotten meat is easily identifiable in this 
area. Rats can be seen scurrying about near the northern 
building, slinking through holes in the walls and gaps between it 
and the neighbouring shop. Traffic is not rare here, mainly 
moving east to west and vice versa.

Between the East and West Slums~
   A fair amount of traffic passes through this area, heading 
east to west and vice versa, though it is rare for anyone to be 
seen stopping to talk. The traffic has cleared the alleyway of 
most rubbish, what still remains being trampled into the muddy 
ground. Rats steer clear of the pathway, preferring instead to 
forage through the piles upon the northern stone wall, where all 
of the refuse has been pushed to. The stench of the slums 
permeates this area, growing heavier as one moves eastwards.

Along the Southern Wall~
   The southern wall of the slums rises up here, tall and stoic. 
Rubbish has been piled along its entire length, at some points 
reaching as high as the dark-skinned men who traffic through this 
area. Rats and rodents, attracted by the foul smell of the 
refuse, scrample across the ground and rubbish here, some even 
daring enough to make their way up to the top of the wall. A 
powerful stench wafts throughout this area, a mixture of human 
waste, rodents and refuse. Very few shanties populate this area.

The Southeastern Corner of the Slums~
   The southern and eastern walls of the slums meet here, rubbish 
piling high on both sides, stacking deep where the walls come 
together. Not many shanties can be seen in this corner of the 
slums, though those that are visible seem to have incorporated 
the rubbish piled against the wall into their structure. The men 
whom do traffic this area are all swarthy skinned and the many 
rodents that populate the rubbish strewn ground scatter as anyone 
approaches. The smell of rodents and the enormous amount of 
rubbish in the area dominates the air, hanging stagnant and 
heavy.

Approaching a Corner of the Slums~
   As the slums follow the eastern wall southwards here the odour 
of refuse and garbage increases, hitting one's nostrils hard. 
Rubbish is piled all along the eastern wall here, which rises up 
as best it can, pieces crumbling down every now and then to fall 
atop the rubbish piles, sending rodents scurrying for cover. The 
path leading to the west goes along in a fairly straight course, 
widening as it disappears between makeshift shacks and shanties. 
Shadows are cast by the eastern wall during the morning hours, 
providing some shade and cover.

Within the Midst of the Slums~
   Rising up to the east here is the bordering wall of the slums, 
its mortar crumbling down onto the near man-height pile of 
rubbish which has accumulated against it. Rats and rodents of 
many different sizes scurry all through this pile, which runs the 
length of the slums north to south, in search of food and 
shelter, both of which there is an abundance of. The wall rises 
up to nearly eight feet in height and is topped by a tiny ledge, 
likely the overhang of a neighbouring roof. The rest of the area 
is not so littered with rubbish, most of it likely having been 
put on the pile, the rest trampled underfoot into the muddy 
ground. A stagnant stench permeates the area, a mixture of human 
waste and rubbish.

as it does. To the east the slum wall rises up, pieces of mortar 
crumbling from its grey surface onto the rubbish which has piled 
up against it, sending the foraging rats and rodents scurrying 
for cover. The stench which permeates this area is disgusting, a 
mixture of human waste, rotten food and vermin and it only 
strengthens as one moves northwards. The traffic in this area 
seem all to be carrying refuse of their own, making their way 
towards the northern dumping pit.

Refuse Dump in the Middle of the Slums~
   A large pit has been formed here, and looks to be the effort 
of alot of labour, spanning nearly twenty-five feet across. The 
purpose of the pit seems clear, it having been filled with 
discarded materials, household rubbish and other general waste to 
the point where the rubbish now piles above the ground level, 
rats seen scurrying over this refuse-pyramid and burying through 
it in search of food and nesting. The smell of this area is 
beyond horrible, the almost tangible smell of human waste mixed 
with the nasal-paralyzing odour of years of rotten food 
composting laying stagnant in the air like some overbearing 
presence. No shanties have been set up anywhere near this pit, 
or even in the vicinity of it and the only people seen are 
dumping more rubbish onto the pile.

A Narrow Path Leading to a Dump~
   A narrow path leads along the eastern wall here, as close at 
it can get without going through the pile of rubbish which has 
accumulated against it. The path seems to slope down towards the 
south and all of the south-bound traffic in the area seem to be 
carrying bags and crates of waste. The smell coming from the 
south is almost over-powering, wafting in from the dumping pit. 
Rats and other rodents can be seen travelling along the top of 
the bordering wall and the pile against it, all of them searching 
for food.

its mortar crumbling down onto the near man-height pile of 
rubbish which has accumulated against it. Rats and rodents of 
many different sizes forage all through this pile in search of 
food and shelter, both of which there is an abundance of. The 
wall, which rises to nearly eight feet in height is topped by a 
tiny ledge, likely the overhang of a neighbouring building's 
roof. Rubbish is scattered over the rest of the area as well, 
trodden into the muddy ground and piling against the shacks and 
shanties which populate the area. The road leading south narrows 
significantly, the putrid smell of rubbish getting stronger.

A Shady Corner of the Slums~
   This small cul-de-sac is dark and disgusting, the eastern and 
northern directions blocked by the bordering wall of the slums, 
rubbish piling almost six feet against it, debris and mortar 
falling from the wall as rats and other rodents scurrying up and 
down, foraging for food. To the west lies what appears to be the 
remnants of an old shanty, blocking all movement in that 
direction save the rats which now inhabit it. The smell of 
rodents, rubbish and refuse is almost overpowering, though it 
thins to the south, where the only exit lies.

A Dark Corner of the Slums~
   This corner of the slums is dark and sombre, the western 
direction blocked by a charred heap of rubble and refuse, topped 
with what looks to be years of human waste, rotten food and other 
various rubbish. The stench of the area s almost overpowering 
and has attracted a large amount of rodents to the area, most 
foraging over the western rubbish, though some scurry atop what 
looks to be the remnants of an old shanty to the east, blocking 
movement in that direction. To the north is the bordering wall 
of the slums, rubbish piled almost six feet against it, debris 
crumbling down sporadically. The only exit is to the south, 
where the smell lets up a little.

Nearing the Edge of the Slums~
   The slums darken here, shadows cast randomly across the now 
wavering paths during the day, little light to be had at all 
during the night. The smell increases as one travels north, 
along the path, now dodging in and around ramshackle shacks and 
shanties, thinning as it approaches a large stone wall visible to 
the north. Rats can be both seen and heard foraging through the 
refuse which is scattered across the area, piling up against a 
sheet-iron wall the the west where the faint sounds of a tavern 
can be heard.

A Slum Path Widening to the West~
   The charred western wall of the eastern slums comes to a halt 
here and the well-worn dirt path widens through the gap into a 
main thoroughfare, slummers of all kinds passing through. This 
traffic has cleared this area of most of its refuse, trampling it 
into the muddy ground or ploughing it aside to bank up against 
the plywood and sheet iron shanties which dot the area. Rats 
scurry over this refuse, the braver ones venturing across the 
path and towards the west.

In the Midst of the Slums~
   Near the middle of the eastern slums the alleys continue here 
as before, the western side blocked by stone rubble from shanties 
past, black scorch marks showing their demise. Rubbish has been 
piled high atop this rubbish, rats and rodents scurrying through 
the refuse as they look for food and shelter, their squeeks heard 
at all times of night and day. The alleys lead straight through 
the grid-like pattern of shanties to the north, east and south, 
the ever-present smell of the slums increasing to the east.

Moving Deeper into the Slums~
   The slums continue here as before, the western side blocked by 
what looks to be the remains of burnt-out shanties, the only 
surviving remnants the stone debris, charred black with flame. 
Rubbish has been piled high atop this wall of rubble, blocking 
and movement in that direction. The alleys lead straight north, 
east and south, rubbish pushed to the side to allow for traffic, 
those frequenting this area all swarthy skinned, their faces 
cautious. The smell of the slums moves with the breeze here, a 
mixture of refuse, human waste and rotten food.

Entering the Eastside Slums~
   The slums open up to the east here, shacks and shanties 
dotting the area, though they seem to follow a regular grid 
structure, the alleys leading north, east and south doing so in a 
relativly straight course. Rubbish litters the intersection 
here, a small pile forming in the very centre where foot traffic 
has pushed it, a few brave rats foraging for a meal here. Though 
relatively more structured than the west side, the stench of the 
slums still wafts throughout this area, a mixture of waste, 
refuse and rubbish.

Moving Deep into the Slums~
   The slums continue here in their almost grid-like fashion, the 
paths remaining relatively straight as they pass between shacks 
and shanties, though the alleys gradually thin as they head east 
and south. Rubbish has been scattered throughout the area though 
most of it now lays trampled underfoot, stomped into the muddy 
ground. Some rubbish still remains piled against a few shacks in 
this area, an unpleasant odour rising from this, attracting rats 
which can be heard most hours of the day and night as they scurry 
about, looking for food.

A Desolate Thoroughfare~
   This road leads east to west, widening as it does. Men and 
women of dark heritage pass through, their faces hidden, voices 
low. To the north an iron door seperates the path from a tavern, 
the sound and smell of people drinking drifting into the area. 
Rubbish and debris have been cleared from the middle of the road, 
piling up on the northern and southern walls, vermin seen burying 
deep into the waste. A hideous smell wafts through the area, a 
mixture of rubbish, rodents and human waste.

remains piling up against the southern wall. The smell of 
stagnant air permeates the area, mixing with the odours of sweat, 
rubbish and waste.

burns through the darker hours with a small, bronze-skinned crowd 
cramming around it for warmth. Smoke, from the leaves the

   In contrast to the rubbish-strewn slums surrounding it, this 
niche has been kept relatively tidy though no-one seems to occupy 
it. Four walls encompass the area, all of which have been made 
from a medley of materials. The eastern wall seems the least 
well formed, a sizeable gap opening where it meets the northern 
iron-sheet wall. The odd rat can be seen passing through this 
area, though they never stay for long, preferring to head to the 
south where a horrid stench wafts over the wall.

   The sheet-iron walls of this large, roughly square room give 
it a bare appearance. Plywood double-doors swing softly every 
now and then in the north exit, a half-rotted lion head mounted 
crookedly above them. Filled torch sconces lie in each of the 
four corners, sending flickering light across the dim and dark 
room. Rickety shelves line the walls, bearing assorted, empty 
glass bottles. Underneath the shelves dark casks are lined up, 
most only half-full. At the southern edge of the room stands a 
short, L shaped bar. Few sounds can be heard to the north, 
though there seems to be plenty of activity within the walls of 
the tavern.

Torch sconces in each of the four corners of the almost-square 
room provide a flickering, dull light and slight warmth. The 
furniture is all of shoddy design and make, just as the walls 
holding up the low ceiling. An old bar runs along the northern 
wall, a simple wooden door behind it. Mongrel humans sparsely 
occupy the room, their voices low. Not much noise can be heard 
from the thoroughfare to the south.

ornamental Haradaic weapons, from the smooth-bladed khanda to the 
brutal kassara'azma. The floor is made of white marble, a myriad 
of colourful veins splaying across the smooth surface. The air 
of the room is cool, compared to the heat of outside, the quiet 
noise of the industrial district traffic drifting in from the 
north. The room plays host to a few individuals of swarthy tone, 
either viewing the displayed weapons or speaking to the 
shop-keep, placing orders.

upper door and floor. The stone floor is swept clean and the 
many shelves benches, and cabinets dusted. The cool stone walls 
are carefully and neatly whitewashed. The air is dry and cool 
and the soft scent of fresh linen and silk.

A Spacious Cedar Armory~
   This spacious closet is lined with aromatic cedar. The 
lap-strake style planking allows for an almost airtight room. 
The rich aroma of the cedar wafts out when the door is open. 
With narrow dimensions along the width of the room, the longer 
wall curves slightly outward and bears half-circle windows near 
the corner of the southern wall and ceiling which allow natural 
light to emphasize the warmth of the wood's color. The floor is 
of intricate, well-laid marble tile, an ivory shade in color with 
strikingly cobalt blue veins.

   Dank and dark, the wooden slats of this narrow room seem to 
sway and creak with the movement of the river beneath, visible 
through cracks in the floorboard. Despite the two lanterns 
hanging from the wall, this room is flooded with shadows, the 
various barrels and crates making movement difficult. An open 
doorway in the western wall allows some light in from the brewing 
room, and a heavy door set just to the north of it leads out into 
the noisy bar room beyond.

   Soft, tan sands lead down to the river, the water lapping up 
lazily onto the bank with a steady pace, flowing back out with 
the same speed. To the north, you can see the clay pit of the 
brickyard, the noise of the workers barely audible down by the 
shore. Down by the bank, built just above the water's attainable 
high-tide, is a rickety wooden dock swaying ever so gently 
with the force of the river.

A Fire-Damaged Courtyard~
   This may once have been a fine courtyard, though the 
flagstones are now blackened and cracked by fire and smoke. All 
around lie the burnt out remains of outbuildings and a fine 
manor, now abandoned and forlorn. Debris is strewn about the 
area.

   This massive hall takes up by far the majority of the space 
provided by the house. Covered in comfortable furs, woven rugs 
and silk covered pillows, the space itself is largely open save 
for the pillows and tables that are scattered throughout and the 
great open hearth at the center of the room. A single ornate 
chair is set upon a dias near the eastern wall not far in front 
of a smaller door. To the north, a series of curtains partition 
off a sleeping quarters from the noise of the hall, while to the 
south a small, low passage leads elsewhere.

furs, while the walls are muted by silk drippings and other 
fineries. Light arrives from a number of bronze sconces lit 
during the night, and windows set high in the stonework during 
the night. On the north side of the room a narrow passage leads 
to another space, while on the south, a spiral stone staircase 
leads upwards.

both the city and the manor itself. The stonework ends near the 
floor, transitioning into wooden, silk draped walls and a plain 
conical roof. The walls themselves are primarily beams for 
supporting the roof set around the large wooden shudders that can 
be swung and latched up to reveal the world around, leaving only 
a thin silken screen of draping cloth.

by stone bricks, then by an additional layer of tapestries and 
silk drapery. An iron sconce sheds light on the darkness of the

   Dark and forbidding, the flame from the iron sconce does not 
cast enough light to entirely banish the shadows from this 
subterranean room. Although aged tapestries depicting 
magnificent scenes line the walls, and numerous chests and tables 
stacked high with goods fill this room, the predominant display

silks, while the ground is covered thick by rugs and furs. At 
the center of the room, surrounded by pillows and rugs, resides a 
simple circular opening in the floor. A well, perhaps, or pond, 
dark, still water fills it to the edges without overflowing.

A Tree Lined Path~
   The underfoot stone of the courtyard dead-ends here into a 
simple earthen path lined on either side by a continuous archway 
of fig-trees. Smaller bushes and shrubs lie at their base, often 
times contained within giant stone urns, while in other places, 
benches provide a good resting spot. Further down the path, the 
archways become a grove, while a small out-building lies to the 
south, set well aside from the vegetation.

   A small stand of trees and bushes here blot out even the 
quieter sounds and bustle of the citys wealthy district. Figs, 
cedar, sandalwood and citrus mix together to form a seemingly 
haphazard garden of sorts, while smaller bushes are interspersed 
between. Spots of sunlight still manage to filter down enough to 
grant life to the grass underfoot, though the broad leaves and 
breeze from the nearby river block out the harsher heat.

three sizable pools, the largest easily able to hold several 
swimmers, while the smaller two provide a place, both warm and

   Built separate from the main house as ward against fire, this 
stone floored building is quite clearly used as a workroom and 
kitchen. A giant, double-sided fireplace monopolizes the center 
of the room, while elsewhere smaller stoves and ovens line the 
walls. Wooden countertops cluttered with all manner of cooking 
ingredients and supplies take up nearly every available piece of 
space left over, with iron racks and hooks hanging above them, 
overflowing with animal carcasses and sheaves of greenery. A 
hatch in one corner of the room leads down into the basement 
cellar, while a staircase in the other leads to a workroom 
overhead.

   With a gentle lapping of rippled waves, the sandy earth gives 
way to the dark waters of the Sheshem-Mew. Reeds stand out by 
the waters edge, neatly surrounding an old stone pier that juts 
out into the river. Set well above the tidal line, the grey 
flagstones that eventually lead to the courtyard begin, although 
here they are frequently covered by all manner of tarp covered 
boxes, raw materials, and finished goods.

clear signs of age. The stone pilings are encrusted with seaweed 
and the wooden crossbeams, though recently replaced, already show 
signs of wear. Still, the pier itself provides an excellent 
vantage point to look out across the great river, or down into

is a long, narrow river boat, its oars neatly stacked.

An Open Air Cage~
   Exposed to the elements, this tiny cage is not so small that 
it was meant for an animal. Forged of dark iron stamped with 
archaic runes, the cage is little more than an iron lattice work

A Lofted Work Room~
   The kitchen borne heat in this arched loft remains stifling 
even with the great wooden end doors swung wide open. Those 
doors, each with a hoist above them, provide an entrance and exit 
to the larger materials used in what is clearly a work-shop. The 
air here is choked thick with sawdust, while underfoot shavings 
of wood, metal and scraps of other materials are scattered across 
the floor. The center of the room is filled with tables and work 
benches, while the eaves are stuffed with boxed supplies.

Above The Gate~
   Simple by design, this battlement walk is a mere portion of 
the wall surrounding the fortified hall. The stone underfoot is 
rough and grating, providing an excellent foothold even in foul 
weather, and though the wall has no crenellations, a wooden 
archers hoarding to the north protects men, forming a firm 
barrier between home and outside.

shelter from rain and projectile, while the lack of a rear wall

Aboard the Eastbane~
   Riding comfortably low in the water, this double-ended 
longship appears designed to be easily propelled through even 
shallow water by sail or by oar. A simple mast resides in the 
center of the boat, while along either side are a series of 
benches for rowers. A wide hatch set forward of the mast allows 
access to below decks.

planks too narrow and too far aft to have benches for rowers. A 
simple yet effective side-board rudder hangs over the starboard 
side, while to the port and stern piece are anchor pots for some 
of the sails many lines. A raised portion of the deck is used to 
house a small ballista.

floor is panelled in light sandalwood, the panels laid expertly

floor is made of white marble, indigo and violet veins running in 
a haphazard pattern of beauty across the floor. A light coat of 
cream coloured paint has been applied to the walls, smooth and 
even, the skirting boards painted gold. Long windows run the 
length of the northern and western walls, overlooking a green 
lawn. During the darker hours brass sconces provide a warm light 
for the room. The air is cool and fresh, neither hot in summer 
not cold in winter.

in the northern wall, able to be opened to vent the room when 
needed. There is plenty of room to move about, with benches 
lining the walls and a pantry set in the eastern wall. A stone 
cistern has been placed out of the way in the southwestern

with a slight golden hue, the northern wall bearing a mural of a 
dark-skinned woman, beautifully silhouetted against the sunlight, 
standing on a dock, a foaming river behind her. A large window 
runs along the eastern wall and the faint sound of running water

tiles running in an intricate frieze around the walls at about 
shoulder height to the average man. The ceiling is high and 
tapers up to a point, five sturdy beams running from floor to 
ceiling to the arched centre of the room. A large bathing pool 
has been set in the very centre of the room, steam rising from it 
when full to collect in the vaulted ceiling, condensation forming 
on the panes of a small, semi-opaque window in the eastern wall. 
The room opens to the west to a lavish bedroom through an arched 
doorway, the stone borders of the archway carved with the same 
knot pattern of the frieze.

A Fire-Ravaged Garden~
   This large outdoor area must once have been part of the 
gardens of the large, ruined manor that sits at their centre. At 
some point, this entire area has been consumed by flames, and the 
result is rather depressing, black and charred.

A Muralled Foyer~
   This roughly square room has been decorated with an artful 
touch, care and skill seeming to have gone into its decoration. 
The southern wall has been painted with a fine mural, of man and 
wildlife; Haradrim spreading out to the left side, with a 
scarlet-clad warrior in the centre, his cloak billowing. 
Standing proud next to this warrior is a male lion, mane flowing 
in the breeze, other various wildlife of the Haradwaithe 
spreading out to the right side. The floor is crafted of 
sandalwood panelling, a soft fragrance rising throughout the 
room, the panels smoothed and polished with care. An intricately 
carved archway leads west to a lounge area.

A Small Stairwell~
   This room is small; whilst offering a comfortable height to 
walk through it is not likely many people could fit through here 
at the same time. A forest green carpet has been laid over the 
flooring here, and the stairs as they lead up, twisting around 
themselves once before coming to a small landing.

A Cramped, Hall-like Cellar~
   This room is cramped, barely wide enough for more then one man 
to stand comfortably, making up for this fact in it's relative 
length. The dark stones of the wall and floor are usually only 
illuminated by a sconced lamp, hanging just above a barred door 
in the eastern wall of the cellar, a small set of bars allowing 
one to peek inside.

A Small Landing~
   The forest green carpet of the stairwell continues here, 
spreading through the small landing as it covers the white stone 
beneath it whilst the walls themselves have been covered with 
stained oak. A large glass window in the northern wall offers a 
view of a lush green garden below, providing light during the 
day. Small brass sconces line the whole stairwell to light one's 
way in the darker hours. An oak door set with stained glass 
panes sits in the southern wall.

A Comfortable Sitting Room~
   A delicate mixture of wealth and modesty this lounge area has 
been crafted of the finest materials with expert care, though 
lavish would be too bold a call to describe it. The walls have 
been painted in warm, inviting earthen tones, a contrast to the 
gold-painted skirting boards which run around the room, top and 
bottom. A tile frieze makes its way around the room at about 
shoulder height, obsidian and the occasional green gemstone 
sparkling in the light. Candles have been mounted in delicate 
sconces in each corner to provide light at night. The floor is 
covered in sandalwood, smoothed and polished with care.

The Master Bedroom~
   This large bedroom is clearly the master bedroom of the house, 
taking up a significant portion of the top floor. It has been 
decorated with comfort in mind, the skirting board painted an 
earthen brown, the walls painted a deep forest green; the 
paintwork smooth as silk on the expertly laid stone walls. 
Large, clear glass windows mirror each other of the northern and 
southern sides of the room, whilst the western wall is covered by 
a mural depicting a buck skipping across the plains. The floor 
is covered in thin sandalwood panneling, a light fragrance 
lifting from its surface.

center of the northern wall, where there sits a fireplace with a 
nearby firewood box, a small table and armchair drawn up near it, 
while a few chests sit below some of the shelving. In the 
western wall, the back of a bookcase blocks the exit, though one 
could easily move it back out of the way.

A Walkway Overlooking a Busy Street~
   Built onto the side of the white brick building that rises to 
the south this wooden walkway juts out over the street below and 
provides a commanding view of the hordes of shoppers who jostle 
each other as they go about their daily business. The walkway 
itself if made of darkly stained wood and is of simple, but very 
sturdy manufacture. A small staircase leads back down to the 
street below, while a curtained doorway provides access to a 
small, yet elegant shop to the south.

   This shop speaks of expense in it's construction, the walls 
are panelled with wood and stained to a richly dark sheen while 
rugs have been spread across the floor to provide comfort 
underfoot. Several counters have been spread about the shop, 
displaying all manner of jewellry, which has been artfully 
displayed with an eye for quality over quantitiy. While never 
partcularly busy, those who do frequent the shop appear to have a 
good deal money to spend judging by their attire.

and stone floor left exposed, however, it is well appointed for 
anything that a jeweler may require to ply their trade. 
Workbenches and racks are filled with tools and a sweltering

only by a few small, yet barred, windows high on the southern

and bears a few chips and other signs of wear, while the air here 
carries a strong, medicinal scent. The workroom is set with only 
the necessary furnishings to create an efficient workspace. 
Small windows are set along the northern wall, barred with iron 
and placed very high up, appearing more for the sake of 
ventilation than light or a view.

flowers offer a delightful whimsy for a child to enjoy. A large 
paned window with heavy shutters looks out over a well tended

   The floor of this office has been covered in the same 
sandalwood panelling that is common throughout this house, buffed 
and polished with care. The adobe stone walls, constructed with 
precision and care, have been painted a sombre grey but a finely 
painted mural, depicting a mirror-image of the office with a 
sand-hue-swathed man hard at work at the desk coats the western 
wall. Large windows are set in the north, east and south walls, 
the northern and southern windows looking across lush, well 
tended gardens whilst the east wall looks out across the top of 
tall cypress trees to Mansur's Way, traffic seen moving along at 
all times. A mahogany door carved with the image of a lion upon 
it leads westwards to a comfortable sitting room.

A Large Lounge Room~
   Far from small this room has a very open feel about it, the 
focus of the room clearly a pillow surrounded table in the centre 
of the room. Each wall has been painted in a soft cream colour, 
the skirting board painted in gold. The floor is made of 
sandalwood panels, smooth to the touch with a gentle fragrance 
rising to perfume the room. Furnished for comfort this room 
serves the purpose of a central lounging area, torch sconces 
providing light in the darker hours. Smells of cooking waft in 
from the northern kitchen, and archways lead east and south to a 
foyer and hallway respectively whilst the room continues 
unhindered westwards to a dining room.

Gardens Surrounding a Manor~
   Running the entire length of the southern side of the manor, 
these gardens are well tended; lush green grass kept both healthy 
and tidy. Vines and flower-bushes line the southern wall, 
flowering in spring to reveal a solid wall of natural, 
rambunctious beauty from bud to fully bloomed flower. A row of 
tall cypress trees runs from east to west, numbering five in 
total to provide plenty of shade during the daylight hours. A 
small pond rests in the middle of the gardens, reeds sprouting 
around its edges, a few fish seen in its depths. Songbirds fill 
the area during the day, drinking from the pond and singing in 
the trees, calling to one another in their sweet melodies. 
Delicate brass torch sconces line the outer wall of the house to 
provide light during the dark hours.

   These gardens run the entire length of the manor, lush green

line the northern wall, flowering in spring into a mirage of 
color and beauty. Tall cypress trees have been planted in a row 
from east to west, numbering five in total and providing shade 
from the harsh sun. Songbirds fill the area during the day, 
their melodious tunes always drifting upon the wind. Delicate 
brass torch sconces line the outer wall of the house to provide

A Long, Lush Sward~
   This long stretch of grass is neither garden nor field, but 
somewhere in between. The grass has been kept tidy and of a lush 
green colour but no flowers or trees are to be seen. The area 
slops down slightly as it circles about the back end of a large 
manor, leading from garden area to garden area. This expanse 
seems to have been kept deliberately free of obstacles such as 
trees, gardens and the features which make up the landscape about 
the rest of the manor.

Through the Housing District~
   The housing district continues here, though the state of the 
road and buildings seems to be gradually deteriorating. The 
road, though it seems to have once been well-paved, has been worn 
down with time and traffic, dirt covering up the once bright 
tiles. The buildings have been treated the same way by time, 
no-one apparently having cared enough to repair the crumbling 
mortar and slipping shale tiles. Traffic here is sparse, those 
that pass through keeping to themselves.

A Deteriorating Road~
   Houses continue to run either side of the road here, though 
they gradually become worse and worse, tiles falling from the 
rooftops and mortar piling at the base of walls. Some of the 
houses have even had their windows and doors blocked up. The 
road itself only gets worse from here on as it leads eastwards, 
tiles becoming rarer and those that remain becoming dirtier. 
Traffic is rare through this area, and those that do walk past 
keep their heads low.

A Decrepit Road~
   The road has finally reached the point where it has degraded 
so far as to longer be tiled, the surface beneath your feet 
solid, packed dirt. The houses continue along the southern side 
of the road, though they are in no better state than the road, 
many of them missing windows, few of them not sporting holes in 
their adobe stone walls. This area speaks of a past greatness, 
with rotting trees lining the road and empty flower-boxes dotting 
the curb. the northern alleyway has been partially blocked off 
by a chain of caravans linked end-to-end.
