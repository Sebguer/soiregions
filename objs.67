their head. There are no soft edges on the crown, all

A titantic trebuchet has been fashioned from black wood, the war machine decorated with dozens of skulls.~
   This trebuchet is longer than a city street, and taller than a 
house, the thing a mammoth construction of blackened wood, iron 
bolts, sinew, rope, wheels, handles, gears and cogs. All manner 
of machinery pieces have been placed about it, but most 
impressive is the bulging counter-weight and weight box that hang 
heavy in the air at the front of the trebuchet. Running from the 
weight box is a long ironwood beam, many ropes of sinew and hemp 
running between the two pieces and a pair of giant turning wheels 
that must be usable by only trolls. The trebuchet is decorated 
with skulls of all shapes and sizes, each crudely pierced through 
a short iron spike.

harden over a mold in the shape of a torso. Dyed a rich, dark
brown, the vest blends well with forest and other terrain, and
upon the center of the breast, the faint embossing of a white
tree is still visible. Around the edges and between the vest and
the back the leather is trimmed in polished silver.

A fine cloak of lion pelt lies here, golden brown in colour.~
   This beautiful cloak has been fashioned from the pelt of a 
lioness and is a tawny, golden-brown in colour, well-tanned and 
sleek. Plush, quilted lining has been stitched to the inside of 
the lion skin to keep the wearer warm and it boasts a deep cowl. 
Down the front of the cloak three large claws have been placed 
and could serve as makeshift buttons, thin leather loops opposite 
them, if the wearer wished to fasten the cloak shut. A silver 
clasp completes the piece: two fangs, presumably from the same 
lioness as the pelt, have been embedded in its surface.
