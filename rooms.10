A Bend in Harad Road South of the River~
   The broad, hard-packed road takes a bend here, following the 
southern banks of the river for a while before turning onto a 
straighter path to the south. To the east, the increasingly 
barren lands slope upward as if to meet the black mountains of 
the Ephel Duath. The lands to the southwest, on the other hand, 
grow greener as they eventually give way to an expanse of 
woodlands.

Southern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The bank of Morgulduin is quite barren, no grass grows and 
only the occasional bush or shrub manages to live, though they 
appear to be dying. Few animals can be seen preferring to hide 
from travellers. The bank is occasionally broken though mostly 
it slopes down into the river. The land closest to the water 
mostly consists of pebbles and small rocks.

Harad Road on the Banks of the Morgulduin~
   The road continues to the north while to the south it crosses 
the pale waters of the Morgulduin over an old, stone bridge. The 
banks of the river here are rocky and barren, no grass grows 
beneath the boulders or in the crevices that line the side of the 
water. Seldom can travelers be seen using this road, the black 
peaks of the Ephel Duath rising ominously a distance to the east.

Southwestern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The pale waters of Morgulduin run in a generally east to 
westerly direction lapping against the rocky shore. The bank of 
the river is barren mostly and in places broken with dirt and 
rocks falling into the water. Shrubs and grasses grow but only 
barely and mostly remain far from the waters edge. The sounds of 
the wind, the occasional bird and the water are the only ones 
that intrude upon this place.

Harad Road North of a Walled Village~
   To the north and south the Harad Road continues on its course 
through the hills and plains of this land. The road is mostly 
packed dirt that has been worn down over the centuries into a 
small ditch compared to the land immediately to either side of 
the road. Grasslands mainly comprise the land around the road 
here, covering the hills in a sea of ripples caused by the wind.

North-West of a Fort in the Ithilien Hills~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks.

Logged Fringe Near the River~
   What once may have been a fringe of light woodlands before the 
foul, flowing waters of the Morgulduin somewhere to the 
north-west is now a plain covered in felled, rotting logs and 
moss-covered tree stumps. The soil is dry, and little wildlife 
moves through the area, the ravaged land and the looming site of 
the eastern fort doing their part is driving any natural life 
away.

Southern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The bank of the river here is mostly barren with only the 
occasional bush or shrub brightening it up. The water of the 
river laps over pebbles and rocks immediately by the waters edge 
and as the bank leaves the water it slopes upward quite quickly. 
Few animals can be heard and even fewer can be seen, travellers 
here are basically nonexistent. 
   To the south an oak and alder woodlands sprouts up in the dry 
Ithilien hills.

Southeastern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The bank of the river here slopes sharply into the water, 
which runs over rounded pebbles and rocks. Trees grow near the 
bank and sometimes roots stick out into the water. Grasses and 
shrubs grow here as well though mostly they seem to be dying and 
these are few and far between. The river is accessible though 
the slope is often slippery.

long past.

safer roads.

Open Woodlands~
   The trees are spaced a good distance from one another, their 
boughs only touching in the areas of thickest growth and casting 
occasional shadows upon the ground. A mixture of deciduous trees 
take root here, from solid oaks and graceful maples to catkin- 
bearing alders. Some ferns and low-lying bushes sprout here and 
there, but not so much as to hinder travelers. The woodlands 
dwindle to the east as they give way to drier hills.

mankind. The ground is soft, covered with fallen leaves and 
catkins from seasons past, several stumps giving evidence of a 
prior forest.

though not very often. Some animals can be heard among the 
undergrowth but they are rarely seen, avoiding contact with 
travelers in these parts. A tall stone wall blocks the way

Ithilien Hills North of a Fort ~
   The rolling hills of the Ithilien come to an end to the 
northwest, overlooking the pale River Morgulduin. The hills are 
often quite forgiving though occasionally sharp rocks or large 
boulders will interrupt the way. Grass grows among the rocks as 
well as among the small green and brown shrubs that also grow in 
the area, only reaching a man's knee in height. To the west an 
oak and alder woodlands sprouts up in the dry Ithilien hills. To 
the southeast the tall, fortified walls of a keep sit upon a 
hill.

Southern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The pale waters of the Morgulduin run in a generally east to 
westerly direction lapping against the rocky shore. The bank of 
the river is barren mostly and in places broken with dirt and 
rocks falling into the water. Shrubs and grasses grow but only 
barely and mostly remain far from the waters edge. The sounds of 
the wind, the occasional bird and the water are the only ones 
that intrude upon this place.

Before the Emyn Arnen~
   The steep, chalky hills known as the Emyn Arnen rise to the 
south. The rock of the hills are white and appear quite crumbly, 
and are far too steep to attempt to climb at this location. A 
few small trees and grasses grow from cracks and pockets in the 
hillsides. The line of hills runs east-to west, with the largely 
forested region of Ithilien to the north.

Before the Emyn Arnen~
   A crumbling mass of white cliffs rises to the south. These 
hills, known in Gondor as the Emyn Arnen, or Royal Hills, are not 
terribly high, but have weathered along this northern flank to 
the point that finding a place to climb up into them is 
difficult. The land before the hills is grassy, leading into the 
pleasant woodlands of Ithilien to the north. The tops of the 
hills, high above, seem to be flat-topped, and likewise grow with 
lush grass. 
   A wide, grassy defile cuts through the hillside to the south, 
rising like a ramp to the top of the Emyn Arnen.

Before the Emyn Arnen~
   A mass of white, chalk-like cliffs rises to the south, 
blocking travel in that direction. Known as the Emyn Arnen in 
Gondor, the mass of hills presents a steep northern face, but 
seems to level off to a grass covered plateau far above. The 
land leading up to this crumbling wall is a pleasant mixture of 
wildflower dotted fields and pastoral forests of North Ithilien.

Before the Emyn Arnen~
   Rising abruptly to the south is the mass of chalky, white
hills known as the Emyn Arnen.  The rock of this face is very
steep and loose, and looks too unstable to climb safely.  The
line of hills runs east to west, and from this vantage point,
look relatively flat on top.  A wide field of grass and scrub
leads up to the base off the cliffs, giving way to the forests
of Northern Ithilien.

In a Grass-Filled Defile Blocked by a Watchtower~
   A fine carpet of mountain grasses and wildflowers grows in 
this wide gap in the side of the Emyn Arnen. Rising to the south 
in a gentle slope, the defile eventually reaches the top of the 
high plateau. Vertical cliffs of white, chalk-like stone border 
the ramp, and contrast with the lush green carpeting on its 
floor. To the north, the ramp widens slightly as it spills out 
onto the pastoral forests and fields of North Ithilien.

In a Grass-Filled Defile~
   Perhaps a hundred yards across, this wide ravine rises gently 
to the top of the Emyn Arnen, which is near at hand to the south.

top. To the north, the defile widens slightly as it empties onto

On Top of the Emyn Arnen, South of a Watchtower~
   Swirling winds send ripples across the tall, slightly browned 
grasses which grow on top of the plateau known as the Emyn Arnen. 
From here, one can view across North Ithilien, its pastoral 
forests and dales a belt of green between the dour mountains of 
the Ephel Duath, and the shining ribbon of the Anduin River. To 
the east, leagues away, a deep rent cuts through the Ephel Duath, 
and settled within are the dark walls, and pale tower of Minas 
Morgul. To the west, facing Minas Morgul almost in defiance, are 
the white walls and towers of Minas Tirith, settled at the feet 
of the White Mountains. 
   A deep, grass field defile descends to the north, spilling 
out into the forests of North Ithilien.

On Top of Emyn Arnen~
   A sweeping expanse of grassland covers the top of the range of 
hills known as the Emyn Arnen. Wind almost constantly plays 
across the plateau, making the grass sway and ripple like water 
in a millpond. The grass grows fairly high here, despite the 
wind, and rises well above knee level. The mainly flat terrain 
is broken occasionally by a stunted tree, a hillock, or a lonely 
boulder. 
   The White Tower of Minas Tirith rises above the tiered city
many leagues to the west.

Above the Anduin in the Emyn Arnen~
   The wind-swept, grassy plateau of the Emyn Arnen ends abruptly
at a steep, vertical drop.  Hundreds of feet far below flows the
Anduin River, its currents, through the ages, have cut through the
soft stone of the hills, and created a sheer cliff face along the
western side of the range.  Across the Anduin, many leagues to the
west, the city of Minas Tirith rises in many tiers at the base of
the White Mountains.  The White Tower stands proudly atop the highest

like waves across a dark green sea. This sea of grass is broken 
occasionally by a large boulder, stunted tree, or deep rent in 
the ground.

On Top of Emyn Arnen~
   Hardy, browning grasses grow to nearly the height of a man's 
knees atop this dry, windswept plateau. The plateau, although 
largely flat, has small rises and depressions, with a larger hill 
rising to the west. The wind here is nearly constant, and 
courses across the grass like waves on a green sea. 
   The elevation here offers an astonishing view, with the White 
Tower of Minas Tirith visible near the horizon to the west. The 
dark mountains of the Ephel Duath rise to the east, making a 
black seeminly impenetrable wall running north to south, as far 
as the eye can see.

A Hillock on Emyn Arnen~
   The top of this treeless hillock is covered in long, brown 
tinged grass, often swept flat by the wind. It's an ideal 
vantage point, providing an excellent view of the land for 
leagues all around. Far to the west is Minas Tirith, the white 
tower rising proudly above its many tiers. To the east lies 
Minas Morgul, its pale tower standing starkly beyond dark walls. 
   Near the top of the hill is a narrow depression partially 
filled with rocks and dirt, leading downward a short distance.

Remains of a Rubble-Strewn Staircase~
   The surrounding stone is dark grey in hue, its surface rough 
and crumbling. Most of the narrow stairs are covered by a layer 
of dirt and rocks. A large boulder rest to the side of the foot 
of the stairs, leading in deeper to the west to some sort of 
animal's lair. Long grass roots poke out from the soil above it, 
and the ground is covered in patches of debris that has been 
blown down here by the wind.

On Top of Emyn Arnen~
   Swirling gusts of dry wind sweep across the high plateau of 
Emyn Arnen. The wind rustles through the brown-tinged grass that 
grows over knee high to a man. The grass, although thick, is 
tough and saw-toothed: well suited for harsh elements. The plain 
is relatively flat, although not featureless: an occasional large 
boulder, ravine, or stunted tree breaks up the horizon.

On Top of Emyn Arnen~
   The usually thick grass which grows atop the plateau of Emyn 
Arnen thins somewhat here. It grows in large clumps, showing 
large patches of barren rocky soil. The wind, however, remains 
the same, and as it gusts across the plateau it picks up sand and 
dead, dry blades of grass. 
   One can begin to see Southern Ithilien from here, a vast dry 
land which sits at the feet of the Ephel Duath, which continues 
south for as far as the eye can see.

On Top of Emyn Arnen~
   Rising high above the green fields of Northern Ithilien, the 
hills of Emyn Arnen grow with thick, dry grass which can reach a 
man's thigh. The plateau is largely flat, but is broken 
occasionally by a rock, hill, or small ravine. The hills offer a 
good view of the surrounding land, and one can see the White 
Tower rising to the west, as well as the black wall of mountains 
which protects the western flank of Mordor to the east. To the 
south, one can begin to see the arid plains which form Southern 
Ithilien. 
   A small grassy rise is to the north.

On Top of Emyn Arnen~
   The normally thick, saw-toothed grass which grows atop most of 
Emyn Arnen are almost entirely absent here. A few, low clumps 
grow here and there, but the ground is mainly a rocky, barren 
soil. The wind sweeps across the barren land, carrying a few 
stray bits of grass, and stinging particles of sand. 
   The lands of Southern Ithilien can be seen from here, and 
stretch to the south as a vast, dry land. These lands, like 
Northern Ithilien, are bordered to the east by a great wall of 
black mountains, the Ephel Duath.

On Top of Emyn Arnen~
   Rippling swirls play across the high, brown tinged grass
which grows on the relatively flat plateau which tops the Emyn
Arnen.  The wind plays with the grass like a gale across an
ocean, and a faint whispering sound can be heard within the
grass with each passing breeze.  The tableau of the sweeping
grass is broken occasionally by a lonely boulder, a rent in
the ground, or a small hill.

Emyn Arnen Near a Drop-Off~
   The high grassy plateau of the Emyn Arnen drops away to the 
west at a rocky cliff. Several hundred feet down an impossibly 
steep and dangerous wall is a gently sloping grassy defile which 
runs south, to the top of Emyn Arnen, and south, to the woodlands 
of Northern Ithilien. The top of Emyn Arnen grows high with 
slightly browned grass, and an occasonal rock or stunted tree. 
   The remnants of stone walls stand about the plateau, blackened
by fire. Random piles of stones, bits of masonry, and timber
framing litter the area. Most of the drop off has fallen away,
along with it major sections of the existing walls.
   Far to the west, the spires and towers of Minas Tirith can be 
seen at the feet of the White Mountains.

Southern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The bank of the river here slopes sharply into the water, 
which runs over rounded pebbles and rocks. Trees grow near the 
bank and sometimes roots stick out into the water. Grasses and 
shrubs grow here as well though mostly they seem to be dying and 
these are few and far between. The river is accessible though 
the slope is often slippery. A wide rift enters the area from 
the south, the ground on the western side rising abruptly as the 
rift closes itself as it runs to the to the north leaving a 
narrow path at the edge of the rift leading to the west.

Before a Narrow Bridge Across the Morgulduin~
   The bank of the river here is mostly barren with only the 
occasional bush or shrub brightening it up. The water of the 
river laps over pebbles and rocks immediately by the waters edge 
and as the bank leaves the water it slopes upward quite quickly. 
Few animals can be heard and even fewer can be seen, travelers 
here are basically nonexistent. An archer's tower rises above 
the bridge. To the north, a narrow stone and wooden bridge 
spans the waters of the river. To the east, the ground has been 
ripped open forming a wide chasm.

Hillside Overlooking the River Morgulduin~
   The rolling hills of the Ithilien come to an end to the 
northwest, overlooking the pale River Morgulduin. The hills are 
often quite forgiving though occasionally sharp rocks or large 
boulders will interrupt the way. Grass grows among the rocks as 
well as among the small green and brown shrubs that also grow in 
the area, only reaching a man's knee in height. 
   To the east, the ground has been ripped open forming a wide 
chasm.

Woodland Fringe Near the River~
   The woods are quiet save for the rustle of foliage and the 
gurgle of flowing water somewhere to the north. Alder trees are 
dominant in the area, though they appear more stunted and frail 
the closer they grow to the river downhill from here. The ground 
is soft, covered with fallen leaves and catkins from seasons past 
and undisturbed by the frequent tread of man. A wide rift in the 
earth runs from the south to the north, the ground towards the
west seemingly lifted and pulled away.

   The woodlands dwindle as the slope of the hill rises towards 
the keep, forest giving way swiftly to grassy field. A number of 
old stumps remain to tell the tale of reclaimed forest, but few 
rise above even knee height. To the east, the imposing stone 
walls of a garrison reside, it's architecture displaying a 
distinctly uncomfortable mix of Haradaic and Gondorian handiwork.

Open Woodlands~
   The trees are spaced a good distance from one another, their 
boughs only touching in the areas of thickest growth and casting 
occasional shadows upon the ground. A mixture of deciduous trees 
take root here, from solid oaks and graceful maples to catkin- 
bearing alders. Some ferns and low-lying bushes sprout here and 
there, but not so much as to hinder travelers. The woodlands 
dwindle to the north as they give way to drier hills.

forcing travelers to push through thickets of thin, twiggy bushes 
and young tree saplings that grow at every perchance between the 
oaks and alders of this region. There is no discernable pathway, 
only faint, winding trails left by passing animals. In places 
where the ground is open, it is covered by a layer of fallen 
leaves, scattered with acorns and mushrooms.

only the occasional bush or shrub manages to live, though they 
appear to be dying. Few animals can be seen preferring to hide 
from travellers. The bank is occasionally broken though mostly 
it slopes down into the river. The land closest to the water 
mostly consists of pebbles and small rocks.

Southern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The landscape here is fairly desolate, the brackish waters of 
the Morgulduin choking off any plant life that does make an 
attempt to grow. The riverbed is steep, muddy, and slippery, 
providing a fair hazard for anyone that wanders too close. As 
the landscape climbs gently to the south, there are signs of life,
however: green fields, with a few trees off in the distance.

   Only the hardiest of shrubs is able to cling onto life near 
the riverbed of the Morgulduin, its brackish waters flowing 
westwards. The riverbank is rocky in most places, muddy where it 
is not rocky, creating a hazard for anyone who would venture to 
its waters. Rolling hills climb to the south, and across the 
river green fields can be seen.

A Dead Tree by the Southern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   A huge tree reaches towards the sky here, alongside the muddy 
riverbanks of the Morgulduin River. Any sign of life has long 
ago disappeared however, leaving only a husk of the once stout 
tree. The ground beneath the dead tree is dry and cracked, 
though the river is near. There is nary a sign of other plant 
life, giving signal to the nature of the river that cuts the 
Ithilien in two.

Southeastern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   Only the hardiest of shrubs is able to cling onto life near 
the riverbed of the Morgulduin, its brackish waters flowing 
westwards. The riverbank is rocky in most places, muddy where it 
is not rocky, creating a hazard for anyone who would venture to 
its waters. Rolling hills climb to the south, and across the 
river green fields can be seen.

Eroded Hills Bordering a Copse of Trees~
   The ground here seems like an afterthought, created after the 
vast expanse of sky. One's eyes are the only limit to visibility 
in all directions. While not flat, the hills here seem to be 
compacted by the weight of the ages, making progress easier for 
travelers. Signs of habitation are few and far between only the 
occasional fence post or fragment of a stone wall hint that 
others have walked here before. The grasses thin out in places 
to reveal small clearings where shrubs are more prevalent.

A Copse of Trees by the Riverbank~
   The lands slope down from the west here, the woodlands meeting 
up with the Morgulduin River. The river winds slowly through the 
countryside, several large boulders visible are jutting up 
through the brackish waters. The riverbank is devoid of any 
meaningful plant life, with grass growing several lengths away. 
The trees start in soon after, a mixture of deciduous and 
coniferous trees, cones dotting the ground.

Lightly Wooded Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The ground here slopes vertically downward to the Morgulduin 
River to the north, the drop being of some height as the river 
cuts through the land below. The dark waters of the Morgulduin 
churn slightly here, flowing through a narrow gap. Few trees 
border the drop, grass and bush receding some distance from the 
river as well. The woodlands stretch on in the other directions.

A Copse of Trees by the Riverbank~
   The land rises above the riverbank here, the land to the north 
cut off by the river, flowing in its westward direction below. 
Tall trees stretch towards the sky, the ground covered by their 
leaves. The canopy is not dense in this region, allowing a good 
amount of light to filter through, leading to a large amount of 
smaller brush to do the area. The woodland continues to the 
south and the east, while to the west a path leads down to the 
riverbed.

Southeastern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The landscape here is fairly desolate, the brackish waters of 
the Morgulduin choking off any plant life that does make an 
attempt to grow. The riverbed is steep, muddy, and slippery, 
providing a fair hazard for anyone that wanders too close. As 
the landscape climbs gently to the south there is sigh of life 
however, green fields present, along with a few visible trees in 
the distance. Due east the riverbank ends as a trail slopes 
quickly upwards.

Countryside Sloping Down to Meet the River~
   The rolling hills slope downward to the north here towards the 
bank of a brackish river. Less and less grass grows as you 
travel northwards, the ground furthest north barren and muddy. 
Grass does seem to thrive to the south however, and trees seem to 
tower to the southeast. There is little sign of animal life in 
the area, save a smaller animal or two feeding on the grass and 
smaller shrubs.

South of a Ruined Bridge Over the Morgulduin~
   The ruins of a stone bridge rise shortly over the Morgulduin 
river to the north, its brackish waters cutting through the area, 
flowing westwards from the dark lands. The bridge is burnt and 
collapsed. The area is mostly desolate, little growing save a 
few more hardier plants and shrubs. This seems to change 
however, the further you move from the riverbed, as the lands to 
the south look more lush, trees visible.

Mouth of the Morgulduin at the River Anduin~
   The brackish waters of the Morgulduin rush into the mighty 
Anduin here, the dark waters mixing with the wide, swift southern 
flowing river. The landscape is fairly spartan, little grows 
near the banks of the dark river. More grass is present however 
the further one goes south, and there are signs of increased 
vegetation as well. Apart from the sound of the two rivers, the 
area is fairly quiet, little animal life nor sign of man.

Weathered Hilltops Overlooking the River~
   Rolling hills extend in every direction, covered in thick 
grasses that range from two to four feet in height. A river is 
visible off to the north, its waters cutting the Ithilien in two 
halves. The land has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so 
far fought off any attempts to cultivate it, though the local 
wildlife has worn narrow tracks which allow passage through the 
more thickly vegetated areas. The light brown earth is only 
visible in areas where an ancient trickle of water may have once 
carved a ravine in ages past.

Weathered Hilltops Overlooking the River~
   Here, the ancient forces of wind and rain have caused the 
collapse of one side of a grassy hill. The wild, tough grasses 
of the area have yet to tame the resultant gash of earth that 
shows like a wound in an otherwise grassy sea. However, they 
have conquered the rest of the softly undulating ground here, and 
the vegetation resists the legs of the passing traveler just as 
the hills tax them.

Woodland Fringe Near the River~
   The woods are quiet save for the rustle of foliage and the 
gurgle of flowing water somewhere to the north. Alder trees are 
dominant in the area, though they appear more stunted and frail 
the closer they grow to the river downhill from here. The ground 
is soft, covered with fallen leaves and catkins from seasons past 
and undisturbed by the frequent tread of man.

Open Woodlands~
   The trees are spaced a good distance from one another, their 
boughs only touching in the areas of thickest growth and casting 
occasional shadows upon the ground. A mixture of deciduous trees 
take root here, from solid oaks and graceful maples to catkin- 
bearing alders. Some ferns and low-lying bushes sprout here and 
there, but not so much as to hinder travelers. The woodlands 
dwindle to the north as they give way to drier hills. A vicious 
tear in the earth runs from the south to the north, the ground 
towards the east being thrust upwards then falling away forming a 
gaping sinkhole.

A Gaping Sink Hole Amid Oak and Alder Woodlands~
   The forest here rides a consistent slope downward from east to 
west. Oak and alder trees predominate the area, but here and 
there a coniferous tree shoots skyward, showing only a long, 
resinous trunk devoid of branches. The forest floor is covered 
with brown needles and leaves of seasons past, providing a rich 
base for the array of fragrant plants that make their home near 
the earth. A gaping sink hole has opened, consuming a vast 
number of trees in its depths. Trees cling to the edges, stout 
roots refusing to give up their grip. A wide rift in the earth 
enters the sink hole from the southwest and leaves to the north.

Oak and Alder Woodlands~
   The woodlands are thick with vegetation along the ground, 
forcing travelers to push through thickets of thin, twiggy bushes 
and young tree saplings that grow at every perchance between the 
oaks and alders of this region. There is no discernable pathway, 
only faint, winding trails left by passing animals. In places 
where the ground is open, it is covered by a layer of fallen 
leaves, scattered with acorns and mushrooms.

Open Woodlands~
   The trees are spaced a good distance from one another, their 
boughs only touching in the areas of thickest growth and casting 
occasional shadows upon the ground. A mixture of deciduous trees 
take root here, from solid oaks and graceful maples to catkin- 
bearing alders. Some ferns and low-lying bushes sprout here and 
there, but not so much as to hinder travelers. The woodlands 
dwindle to the east as they give way to drier hills.

Hilly Scrublands West of a Road~
   Here, the ancient forces of wind and rain have caused the 
collapse of one side of a grassy hill. The wild, tough grasses 
of the area have yet to tame the resultant gash of earth that 
shows like a wound in an otherwise grassy sea. However, they 
have conquered the rest of the softly undulating ground here, and 
the vegetation resists the legs of the passing traveler just as 
the hills tax them.

A Bend in Harad Road~
   North and east continues Harad Road in a seemingly endless 
journey over the land, carrying those who travel upon it through 
a variety of terrains. At the moment, barren scrubland are 
bordering the road to the west, as they mark the beginnings of 
the great plain of South Ithilien spreading forth in that 
direction. The eastern horizon is dominated by a constant line 
of black mountains.

A Bend in Harad Road~
   The road continues to the west and south through grasslands 
which seem to become ever more dry and arid as it heads towards 
the mountains that loom in the distance to the east. The road is 
mostly made of dirt though occasionally a stone sticks out 
resembling what might have been an ancient cobblestone from times 
long past.

Harad Road~
   To the north and south the Harad Road continues on its course 
through the hills and plains of this land. The road is mostly 
packed dirt that has been worn down over the centuries into a 
small ditch compared to the land immediately to either side of 
the road. Grasslands mainly comprise the land around the road 
here, covering the hills in a sea of ripples caused by the wind.

Hilly Scrublands West of a Road~
   Overgrown grasses and scraggly weeds cover the relatively flat 
ground, interspersed with an occasional twiggy bush. The ground 
underfoot is hard and dry, making travel relatively easy, though 
one could find little reason to do so here. Several huge rocks 
have been thrust upwards, blocking travel to the west here. The 
dry grasslands span on as far as the eye can see to the south, 
while to the west and north greener fields can be seen a distance 
off.

Under the Canopy of Oak Trees~
   Large oak trees cast their shade here, obscuring the sky. Few 
others can compete with the ancient oaks, whose branches have 
spread outward as much as they have spread upward. Their trunks 
are massive, suggesting centuries of growth. Here and there, 
scorch marks are visible on the bark, but it seems that even fire 
was not able to harm these giants. The grass has also seen the 
touch of flame, although it seems to have been far into the past. 
A wagon trail is slowly being worn in the grass in the area, 
leading north and west.

halves. The land has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so 
far fought off any attempts to cultivate it, though the local 
wildlife has worn narrow tracks which allow passage through the 
more thickly vegetated areas. The light brown earth is only

carved a ravine in ages past. A wagon trail is slowly being worn

for an occasional forest animal wandering cautiously through or a 
small bird singing its song. A wagon trail is slowly being worn

   The woodlands grow here, the trees more dense and stout than 
those in the distance are. They seem to be a mixture of more 
temperate growing trees, their pinecones covering the ground. 
There is a wide opening in the woods here, the trees giving way 
to the land in a semi-circular pattern. Within the open glade 
grass and flowers grow, free of the towering trees. There is no 
sign of civilization here, save the errant hunter braving the 
dangers of the Ithilien. A wagon trail is slowly being worn in

south, though keep their gentle rolling slope for the most part. 
The countryside continues in the same fashion in every direction, 
the familiar grassy fields stretching onward. A very old wooden 
shack stands here, few planks standing, the entire structure 
leaning greatly to one side. A rickety fence surrounds it, also 
barely standing.

Ithilien Farmlands West of a Small Forest~
   Grassy fields dominate the terrain here, stretching to the 
south and west. An errant tree can be seen here or there but the 
land is open for the most part, the winds rolling across it 
without much in the way. The lands to the east change slightly a 
forest looming in the distance, where to the north a wide 
brackish river cuts the Ithilien in two.

Light Woodland Fringe~
   The rolling hills of the Southern Ithilien meet here with a 
wall of trees to the east. The trees vary somewhat in species, 
many seemingly quite old. The ground is covered in small green 
and brown bushes that sprout out of a layer of fallen leaves from 
seasons past. Light filters through from above, only partially 
blocked by leaves and branches.

A Thicket of Alder Trees~
   A dense thicket of alder trees dots the landscape here, their 
canopy stretching far above. Their shadow is not dense enough 
however to prevent growth at the ground level, as numerous small 
bushes and brush cover the area. The area is quiet and tranquil, 
save for an occasional forest animal wandering cautiously through 
or a small bird singing its song.

Near a Scorched Tree~
   The woods are still light here, the trees somewhat sparse. 
Smaller brush mostly dominate the area, from thistly plants to 
larger flower covered bush. The trees that are here are somewhat 
smaller, cone bearing trees, providing little shade upon the 
ground. One tree stands out from the others, more stout of trunk 
and taller, yet is made distinct even more so by a spiraling 
scorch mark running its entire length, winding down its trunk. A 
wagon trail, slowly being worn in the grass passes north and 
south here.

Ithilien Countryside Bordering Trees~
   Rolling hills extend in every direction, covered in thick 
grasses which range from two to four feet in height. The land 
has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so far fought off any 
attempts to cultivate it, though the local wildlife has worn 
narrow tracks which allow passage through the more thickly 
vegetated areas. The light brown earth is only visible in areas 
where an ancient trickle of water may have once carved a ravine 
in ages past.

Hilly Countryside West of a Copse~
   The ground here seems like an afterthought, created after the 
vast expanse of sky. One's eyes are the only limit to visibility 
in all directions. While not flat, the hills here seem to be 
compacted by the weight of the ages, making progress easier for 
travelers. Signs of habitation are few and far between only the 
occasional fence post or fragment of a stone wall hint that 
others have walked here before. The grasses thin out in places 
to reveal small clearings where shrubs are more prevalent.

A Quiet Copse of Trees~
   The woodlands here are a mix of deciduous and coniferous 
trees. The ground undulates slightly, providing high places for 
the pines and firs, and lower places for thickets of young alder 
trees. Ferns and brown moss grow in clumps underfoot. Strangely 
enough, bird-song and the movements of other small animals are 
conspicuously absent. The woods manage to be lush but empty at 
the same time.

Hilly Countryside East of a Copse~
   Rolling hills extend in every direction, covered in thick 
grasses which range from two to four feet in height. A river is 
visible off to the north, its waters cutting the Ithilien in two 
halves. The land has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so 
far fought off any attempts to cultivate it, though the local 
wildlife has worn narrow tracks which allow passage through the 
more thickly vegetated areas. The light brown earth has been 
ripped open, the ground to the east having been thrust upwards, 
leaving a deep chasm.

line the nothern curve of the rip, creating a bridge across the

   Large oak trees cast their shade here, obscuring the sky. Few 
others can compete with the ancient oaks, whose branches have 
spread outward as much as they have spread upward. Their trunks 
are massive, suggesting centuries of growth. Here and there, 
scorch marks are visible on the bark, but it seems that even fire 
was not able to harm these giants. The grass has also seen the 
touch of flame, although it seems to have been far into the past.

oaks and alders of this region. There is no discernable pathway, 
only faint, winding trails left by passing animals. In places 
where the ground is open, it is covered by a layer of fallen 
leaves, scattered with acorns and mushrooms.

ground, interspersed with an occasional twiggy bush. The ground 
underfoot is hard and dry, making travel relatively easy, though 
one could find little reason to do so here. The dry grasslands 
span on as far as the eye can see to the south, while to the west 
and north greener fields can be seen a distance off. Several huge 
rocks have been thrust upwards, impeding travel to the east here.

Hilly Scrublands West of a Road~
   Rolling hills extend in every direction, covered in thick 
grasses which range from two to four feet in height. The land 
has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so far fought off any 
attempts to cultivate it, though the local wildlife has worn 
narrow tracks which allow passage through the more thickly 
vegetated areas. The light brown earth is only visible in the 
steep sides of the deep graben that runs from the west to the 
east.

Harad Road~
   North and south continues Harad Road in a seemingly endless 
journey over the land, carrying those who travel upon it through 
a variety of terrains. At the moment, barren scrubland are 
bordering the road to the west, as they mark the beginnings of 
the great plain of South Ithilien spreading forth in that 
direction. A wide graben runs in from the west, gradually rising 
to be level with the road. The eastern horizon is dominated by a 
constant line of black mountains.

Harad Road~
   The road continues to the north and south through grasslands 
which seem to become ever more dry and arid as it heads towards 
the mountains that loom in the distance to the east. The road is 
mostly made of dirt though occasionally a stone sticks out 
resembling what might have been an ancient cobblestone from times 
long past. A wide graben runs in from the west, gradually rising 
to be level with the road.

Hilly Scrublands West of a Road~
   The ground here is rather arid, dotted with small, green and 
brown shrubs and a mixture of yellow and pale-green grasses. 
Travel is made easy by the hardened earth, though there is 
neither sign of civilization, nor any reason for one to travel 
here apparent. The light brown earth is only visible in the 
steep sides of the deep graben that runs from the southwest to 
the northeast.

Patchy, Scrub-Dotted Hills~
   A deep and wide graben, a great gash, runs from the south to 
the east, resulting in the collapse of one side of a grassy hill. 
The wild, tough grasses of the area have yet to tame the 
resultant gash of earth that shows like a wound in an otherwise 
grassy sea. However, they have conquered the rest of the softly 
undulating ground here, and the vegetation resists the legs of 
the passing traveler just as the hills tax them.

Eroded Hillside Overlooking Woodlands~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks.

   The trees are spaced a good distance from one another, their

occasional shadows upon the ground. A mixture of deciduous trees 
take root here, from solid oaks and graceful maples to catkin- 
bearing alders. Some ferns and low-lying bushes sprout here and 
there, but not so much as to hinder travelers. The woodlands 
dwindle to the east as they give way to drier hills.

Oak and Alder Woodlands~
   The forest here rides a consistent slope downward from east to 
west. Oak and alder trees predominate the area, but here and 
there a coniferous tree shoots skyward, showing only a long, 
resinous trunk devoid of branches. The forest floor is covered 
with brown needles and leaves of seasons past, providing a rich 
base for the array of fragrant plants that make their home near 
the earth.

   Curving down towards the west and then rising again in the 
distance, the ground is remarkably clear of trees and tangling 
underbrush. Instead, grass no higher than the shin grows in 
large patches, visibly trampled in places where animals have

Oak and Alder Woodlands~
   The woodlands are thick with vegetation along the ground, 
forcing travelers to push through thickets of thin, twiggy bushes 
and young tree saplings that grow at every perchance between the 
oaks and alders of this region. There is no discernable pathway, 
only faint, winding trails left by passing animals. In places 
where the ground is open, it is covered by a layer of fallen 
leaves, scattered with acorns and mushrooms.

halves. The land has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so

vast expanse of sky. One's eyes are the only limit to visibility

travelers. Signs of habitation are few and far between only the 
occasional fence post or fragment of a stone wall hint that

trees. Ferns and brown moss grow in clumps underfoot. Strangely 
enough, bird-song and the movements of other small animals are 
conspicuously absent. The woods manage to be lush but empty at

apparently long ago forgotten by those who originally built it. 
Several planks from its walls are missing, and the structure as a 
whole doesn't seem very sturdy. The lands around the shack

most spots, and quite steep in others, creating somewhat of a 
hazard. There are however, safe routes down to the river, most 
of these tramped by untold number of animals as they move to get 
a drink. Beyond the river snow capped mountains loom to the 
west. A hillock rises toward the riverside to the north, ending 
in a rocky escarpment. A trail is being worn in the fields 
running the gate towards the east.

Ithilien Farmlands on Gentle Slopes, Southeast of a Tower~
   The rolling countryside continues onward here, stretching out 
in every direction. The fields are covered in grass, a few 
medium sized trees providing some shade. There are several large 
boulders jutting from the ground as well, moss and grass slowly 
reclaiming them back to the earth. All in all the area is fairly 
quiet, typical for the surrounding landscape.

Ithilien Farmlands on Gentle Slopes~
   The rolling farmlands of the Southern Ithilien begin to slop 
noticeably upwards here to the southeast. A few smaller trees 
cast a bit of shade, however the fields are mostly covered in 
grass, with various small brush and bush present. An occasional 
hunter can be seen stalking its prey, be it man or animal, but 
for the most part these lands are quiet.

Ithilien Countryside Adjacent to Tended Fields~
   The ground here seems like an afterthought, created after the 
vast expanse of sky. One's eyes are the only limit to visibility 
in all directions. While not flat, the hills here seem to be 
compacted by the weight of the ages, making progress easier for 
travelers. Signs of habitation are few and far between; only the 
occasional fence post or fragment of a stone wall hint that 
others have walked here before. The grasses thin out in places 
to reveal small clearings where shrubs are more prevalent.

Atop Rolling Hills~
   Rolling hills extend in every direction, covered in thick 
grasses which range from two to four feet in height. The land 
has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so far fought off any 
attempts to cultivate it, though the local wildlife has worn 
narrow tracks which allow passage through the more thickly 
vegetated areas. The light brown earth is only visible in areas 
where an ancient trickle of water may have once carved a ravine 
in ages past.

Ithilien Countryside Bordering Trees~
   Rolling hills extend in every direction, covered in thick 
grasses which range from two to four feet in height. A river is 
visible off to the north, its waters cutting the Ithilien in two 
halves. The land has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so 
far fought off any attempts to cultivate it, though the local 
wildlife has worn narrow tracks which allow passage through the 
more thickly vegetated areas. The light brown earth has been 
ripped open, a wide chasm opening from the cliffs of the Emyn 
Arnen running to the northeast. The ground towards the northwest 
having been thrust upwards.

Open Woodlands~
   The trees are spaced a good distance from one another, their 
boughs only touching in the areas of thickest growth and casting 
occasional shadows upon the ground. A mixture of deciduous trees 
take root here, from solid oaks and graceful maples to catkin- 
bearing alders. Some ferns and low-lying bushes sprout here and 
there, but not so much as to hinder travelers. The woodlands 
dwindle away to countryside in all directions except eastward.

A Clearing Between the Trees~
   This clearing appears naturally formed and curves around to 
the northeast while trees of the woodlands proper rise on either 
side, spreading their limbs. Birdsong occasionally echos in the 
distance, but few other sounds are to be heard save the rustle of 
wind. The forest comes to an end southward where grass-covered 
hills comprise the landscape as far as the eye can see.

Oak and Alder Woodlands~
   The forest here rides a consistent slope downward from east to 
west. Oak and alder trees predominate the area, but here and 
there a coniferous tree shoots skyward, showing only a long, 
resinous trunk devoid of branches. The forest floor is covered 
with brown needles and leaves of seasons past, providing a rich 
base for the array of fragrant plants that make their home near 
the earth.

Oak and Alder Woodlands~
   The woodlands are thick with vegetation along the ground, 
forcing travelers to push through thickets of thin, twiggy bushes 
and young tree saplings that grow at every perchance between the 
oaks and alders of this region. There is no discernable pathway, 
only faint, winding trails left by passing animals. In places 
where the ground is open, it is covered by a layer of fallen 
leaves, scattered with acorns and mushrooms.

   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks.

small ditch compared to the land immediately to either side of 
the road. Grasslands mainly comprise the land around the road 
here, covering the hills in a sea of ripples caused by the wind.

An Arched, Stone Bridge Over the River~
   Wide enough for perhaps two horsemen to ride abreast, this 
bridge arches upward slightly towards the center as it crosses 
over the waters of the Morgulduin several feet below. Its 
mottled grey stones have fallen into disrepair, crumbling along 
the edges and cracked in places. The sound of flowing water is 
amplified as it passes under the bridge, echoing up to fill the 
ears of travelers passing through.

Eroded Hillside Overlooking Woodlands~
   A deep and wide graben, a great gash, runs from the south to 
the east, resulting in the collapse of one side of a grassy hill. 
The wild, tough grasses of the area have yet to tame the 
resultant gash of earth that shows like a wound in an otherwise 
grassy sea. However, they have conquered the rest of the softly 
undulating ground here, and the vegetation resists the legs of 
the passing traveler just as the hills tax them.

A Wild Olive Grove~
   Trees of all kinds are present, but olive trees seem to 
predominate due to the heavy sun on the southern slopes of these 
hills. The ground is covered with shorter grass, as though the 
olive trees have stolen all the water from the remaining flora. 
The air is filled with a fresh fragrance, and travel is as easy 
as avoiding the spreading olive branches. Smaller plants are 
interspersed in the shadier areas, colorful clusters of aster, 
and juniper bushes with small blue berries. The earth has fallen
away to the south, forming a deep and wide graben, like a great
gash.

Along Rolling Hills~
   Rolling hills extend in every direction, covered in thick 
grasses which range from two to four feet in height. The land 
has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so far fought off any 
attempts to cultivate it, though the local wildlife has worn 
narrow tracks which allow passage through the more thickly 
vegetated areas. The light brown earth is only visible in areas 
where an ancient trickle of water may have once carved a ravine 
in ages past. 
   To the south, the chalky white hills known as the Emyn Arnen 
rise up, preventing travel in that direction.

Patchy, Scrub-Dotted Hills~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks.

Eroded Hillside Overlooking Wild Grasslands~
   Here, natural forces of the earth have caused the collapse of 
many a grassy hill. A deep and wide graben runs like a gash in 
the earth from the cliffs of the Emyn Arnen to the northeast, 
wild grass covering the softly undulating ground on either side.

murky, possessing a greenish tinge from the numerous plants and 
algae that thrive within it. The water is cool, but not too 
cold, and insects can be seen darting or hovering about nearby. 
Along the northern edge of the pond, a few willow trees lean over 
the banks to form a curtain of wispy leaves.

outside light only gives mere outlines of objects within the cave 
through the obstructive stalagtites. Further into the cave is a 
deep, forebodeing pitch black.

carefully flattened out. Clear signs of recent objects and 
movement in the area. A slight scent of fire lingers from a 
small pile of charred sticks in the corner, a few boxes stacked 
next to them. The path southward leads towards a soft,

holes and tunnels, allowing anyone stationed above to rain ruin

bridge arches upward slightly towards the center as it crosses 
over the waters of the Morgulduin several feet below. Its 
mottled grey stones have fallen into disrepair, crumbling along 
the edges and cracked in places. The sound of flowing water is 
amplified as it passes under the bridge, echoing up to fill the

A Narrow, Rocky Plateau Before the Ephel Duath~
   The hard grass that rolls in from the west quickly becomes 
even tougher rock under foot, a narrow plateau continuing before 
the unscaleable sides of the Ephel Duath tear up from the ground, 
ending so high in the sky that one must crane their neck back to 
view the splintered peaks in their malignant majesty. North and 
south the range continues without any apparent end. 
   From between two of the the mighty peaks that rise up to the 
East comes pouring down a vibrant trail of water, dashed into 
bright foam across the jagged rocks of the mountains, before 
forming in to a gurgling, water-etched basin to the north. From 
here, the waters cut a course westward through a narrow valley 
carved out through time and wear, heading down the incline of the 
great tableau of South Ithilien.

Desolate Hills Growing Steeper To The East~
   Travel through these hills is far from easy; the landscape 
climbs and falls, yet uniformly grows more steep and stark as it 
heads east to the towering, shard-like black mountains that mark 
the lands of Mordor. No human habitation is visible this close 
to dark border, but across the west the occasional fortified 
village or isolated farmhouse can be seen.

Wind-Swept, Musty-Scented Foothills~
   Howling wind funnels down the notches and gaps in the 
splintered peaks of the black mountains of Mordor that burst from 
the ground to the east, a short run of increasingly rocky and 
steep terrain rising up to them. Along with the wind comes the 
smell of something old, a chill presence and the occasional fine 
dust of soot.

Barren, Hard-Soiled Foothills~
   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby

the wind. More often than not, great gusts of air blow down from 
the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the mighty 
Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

to be seen here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make 
their homes in the craggy lips and caves visible on the surface

   A sweeping expanse of grassland covers the top of the range of 
hills known as the Emyn Arnen. Wind almost constantly plays 
across the plateau, making the grass sway and ripple like water 
in a millpond. The grass grows fairly high here, despite the 
wind, and rises well above knee level. The mainly flat terrain 
is broken occasionally by a stunted tree, a hillock, or a lonely 
boulder. 
   To the west, a drop of no small distance falls directly down 
into the powerful waters of the Anduin, surging past the rock 
formation of the Emyn Arnen.

East Of a Plummeting Drop On The Emyn Arnen~
   Rising high above the green fields of Northern Ithilien, the 
hills of Emyn Arnen grow with thick, dry grass which can reach a 
man's thigh. The plateau is largely flat, but is broken 
occasionally by a rock, hill, or small ravine. The hills offer a 
good view of the surrounding land, and one can see the White 
Tower rising to the west. To the south, one can begin to see the 
thin forest and arid plains which form Southern Ithilien. 
   West, a sheer drop of a good three dozen feet lies, down below 
it the tops of stunted pines and oaks visible.

   A few white boulders and rents in the earth are nearly all 
that interrupt this wind-swept plateau of grass high above the 
forests of Northern Ithilien. The brown tinged grass rustles and 
ripples with each passing breeze, and, despite the near constant 
wind, grows above knee high to a man. 
   To the south and the west a sheer drop gives way on to a 
series of forested hills that roam about the edge of the Anduin.

Arnen thins somewhat here. It grows in large clumps, showing 
large patches of barren rocky soil. The wind, however, remains 
the same, and as it gusts across the plateau it picks up sand and 
dead, dry blades of grass. 
   The sheer eastern face of the Emyn Arnen is less imposing 
here, instead a gradual incline allowing one to climb down on to 
another level of the plateau.

Atop The Emyn Arnen~
   A few white boulders and rents in the earth are nearly all
that interrupt this wind-swept plateau of grass high above the
forests of Northern Ithilien.  The brown tinged grass rustles
and ripples with each passing breeze, and, despite the near
constant wind, grows above knee high to a man.

A Wide Plateau High Above North Ithilien~
   Rising high above the green fields of Northern Ithilien, the 
hills of Emyn Arnen grow with thick, dry grass which can reach a 
man's thigh. The plateau is largely flat, but is broken 
occasionally by a rock, hill, or small ravine. The hills offer a 
good view of the surrounding land, and one can see the White 
Tower rising to the west. To the south, one can begin to see the 
thin forest and arid plains which form Southern Ithilien.

Along A Sweeping Expanse Of Grassland~
   A sweeping expanse of grassland covers the top of the range of 
hills known as the Emyn Arnen. Wind almost constantly plays 
across the plateau, making the grass sway and ripple like water 
in a millpond. The grass grows fairly high here, despite the 
wind, and rises well above knee level. The mainly flat terrain 
is broken occasionally by a stunted tree, a hillock, or a lonely 
boulder.

East Of A Spit Of Rock Atop The Emyn Arnen~
   Swirling gusts of dry wind sweep across the high plateau of 
Emyn Arnen. The wind rustles through the brown-tinged grass that 
grows over knee high to a man. The grass, although thick, is 
tough and saw-toothed: well suited for harsh elements. The plain 
is relatively flat, although not featureless: an occasional large 
boulder, ravine, or stunted tree breaks up the horizon. 
   To the east, a spit of rock rises up, a gradual incline from 
this segment of the Emyn Arnen leading up to the narrow climb.

large patches of barren rocky soil. The wind, however, remains 
the same, and as it gusts across the plateau it picks up sand and 
dead, dry blades of grass.

   This spit of stone ends in a narrow trail descending to the

   Climbing this trail is far from an easy chore, progress forced 
to be made through grabbing at jagged rock outcroppings and 
branches that shoot out from the grey rock face to the north and 
east. Above, the faintly waving tall grass at the top of the 
Emyn Arnen can be seen, while below rocky land lies.

   Hardy, browning grasses grow to nearly the height of a man's 
knees atop this dry, windswept plateau. The plateau, although 
largely flat, has small rises and depressions, with a larger hill 
rising to the west. The wind here is nearly constant, and 
courses across the grass like waves on a green sea. 
   To the north, the steep wall of another plateau of the Emyn
Arnen rises up, a thin, steep trail winding its way up the side
of the white rock.

Barren Climb On the Face of the Emyn Arnen~
   While possible to ascend and descend the face of the squat 
mountain plateau known as the Emyn Arnen here, the climb is far 
from leisurely; one is forced to haul themselves up with their 
hands and feet up the nearly sheer surface, grappling upon rocks 
and the roots of small trees that sprout out. Already, from this 
height of maybe half a dozen feet, a view of the vast hitherlands 
of Gondor can be seen to the north.

Before the Sheer Face of the Emyn Arnen~
   The grass of South Ithilien thins here as it approaches the 
southern steppes known as the Emyn Arnen. Atop of the maybe 
sixty foot incline sits numerous boulders and sloping plateaus, 
the occasional bird soaring across the sky. Yet, as sheer and 
imposing the face appears, a faint indication of a vertical trail 
can be seen; rocks scuffed and trees devoid of leaves marking the 
course of the difficult climb that lies to entrance to the Emyn

Through A Barren Strip Of Emyn Arnen~
   The normally thick, saw-toothed grass which grows atop most of 
Emyn Arnen are almost entirely absent here. A few, low clumps 
grow here and there, but the ground is mainly a rocky, barren 
soil. The wind sweeps across the barren land, carrying a few 
stray bits of grass, and stinging particles of sand.

Through The Wind-Rustled Blades Of Grass~
   A few white boulders and rents in the earth are nearly all
that interrupt this wind-swept plateau of grass high above the
forests of Northern Ithilien.  The brown tinged grass rustles
and ripples with each passing breeze, and, despite the near
constant wind, grows above knee high to a man.

High Above The Northern Ithilien, Atop A Broad Plateau~
   Rising high above the green fields of Northern Ithilien, the 
hills of Emyn Arnen grow with thick, dry grass which can reach a 
man's thigh. The plateau is largely flat, but is broken 
occasionally by a rock, hill, or small ravine. The hills offer a 
good view of the surrounding land, and one can see the White 
Tower rising to the west. To the south, one can begin to see the 
thin forest and arid plains which form Southern Ithilien.

   A sweeping expanse of grassland covers the top of the range of 
hills known as the Emyn Arnen. Wind almost constantly plays 
across the plateau, making the grass sway and ripple like water

   Despite the steep front they present to the north, the top of 
the hills known in Gondor as the Emyn Arnen is a wide, flat 
plateau growing thick with waist high dry grasses. A near 
constant wind sweeps through the grass in strong gusts, looking 
like waves across a dark green sea. This sea of grass is broken 
occasionally by a large boulder, stunted tree, or deep rent in 
the ground. 
   To the south, the high ridge of the Emyn Arnen gives way to a 
narrow, steep and dangerous trail, leading down past the tree 
tops in to a hilly woodland.

circling past the coniferous trees that cover the hilly lands to 
the south and east before the plateaus. Losing one's footing is 
a near fatal exercise, the sharp incline of the ground 
guaranteeing a fall back to the base of the trail, while at the 
end the sparse grasslands of the Emyn Arnen sway in the wind that 
near-always blows through here.

north-west, as the looming steppes of the Emyn Arnen rise up from 
the hilly ground of South Ithilien. Various creatures of the 
forest roam through the area, and birdsong is common in the air, 
the occasionally stunted root branched out from the steep slopes 
of the steppes. However, passage up to the top of the Emyn Arnen 
seems possible here, through a steep, perilous trail that zigzags 
back and forth up the side of the rock formation.

Hilly Scrublands~
   Here, the ancient forces of wind and rain have caused the 
collapse of one side of a grassy hill. The wild, tough grasses 
of the area have yet to tame the resultant gash of earth that 
shows like a wound in an otherwise grassy sea. However, they 
have conquered the rest of the softly undulating ground here, and 
the vegetation resists the legs of the passing traveler just as 
the hills tax them. 
   To the south, the chalky-white plateau of Emyn Arnen rises 
above South Ithilien.

Eroded Hillside Overlooking Woodlands ~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks. 
   To the south-west, the chalky-white plateau of Emyn Arnen 
rises above South Ithilien.

Patchy, Scrub-Dotted Hills~
   Rolling hills extend in every direction, covered in thick 
grasses which range from two to four feet in height. The land 
has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so far fought off any 
attempts to cultivate it, though the local wildlife has worn 
narrow tracks which allow passage through the more thickly 
vegetated areas. The light brown earth is only visible in areas 
where an ancient trickle of water may have once carved a ravine 
in ages past.

Cracked Fields South of a Burned Barricade~
   Perhaps once the site of tilled fields and tended farms, these 
plains of South Ithilien are now bleak and home to only tall 
grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly 
from the distant black mountains eastward to the western horizon 
are the fractured remainders of buildings past; the odd, 
blackened wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds 
and moss, an old, dried up well. An encampment sprawls up and 
down the slope of the hill. 
   The rutted dirt trail continues around the charred husk of a 
once sturdy barn allowing you to 'enter' the 'camp'.

Rolling Hills near the Towering Ephel Duath~
   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby 
and wiry bushes, and some stretches of pale grass that bows in 
the wind. More often than not, great gusts of air blow down from 
the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the mighty 
Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

growths and small valley drops, covered in a coating of yellow 
grass. The occasional animal stalks through the area, though 
most common are circles of soaring birds high in the air, 
drifting on the winds that blow across South Ithilien. To the 
west, the vast, dry plains of Gondor's hither lands stretch.

   Here, the ancient forces of wind and rain have caused the 
collapse of one side of a grassy hill. The wild, tough grasses 
of the area have yet to tame the resultant gash of earth that 
shows like a wound in an otherwise grassy sea. However, they 
have conquered the rest of the softly undulating ground here, and 
the vegetation resists the legs of the passing traveler just as 
the hills tax them.

dominated by a constant line of black mountains. A narrow dirt 
trail leads to the north.

falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that

of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
fields of South Ithilien westward, to the mighty, stark mountain 
face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

Barren Landscape South and East of a Road~

tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

Barren Stretch of Land West of the Ephel Duath~

South Ithilien that lie between the low lying plains to the west

Small animal life darts amongst the clustered clumps of 
vegetation, as well as the occasional larger predator lurking far 
from the distant plateau to the northwest, or the forest westward.

the landscape.

Foothills Of The Ephel Duath~
   The ground here is far from flat, rising in waves of hills and 
falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that 
spurts forth from the ground and is accompanied by a clustering 
of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
fields of South Ithilien westward, to the mighty, stark mountain 
face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

A Rocky Dip Amongst Barren Hills~
   Travel through these hills is far from easy; the landscape 
climbs and falls, yet uniformly grows more steep and stark as it 
heads east to the towering, shard-like black mountains that mark 
the lands of Mordor. No human habitation is visible this close 
to dark border, but across the west the occasional fortified 
village or isolated farmhouse can be seen.

A Steep, Barren Hill before the Ephel Duath~
   Howling wind funnels down the notches and gaps in the
splintered peaks of the black mountains of Mordor that burst from
the ground to the east, a short run of increasingly rocky and
steep terrain rising up to them. Along with the wind comes the
smell of something old, a chill presence and the occasional fine

here the land descends rapidly as it heads south in a series of

Arnen that cast a noon shadow over this rocky slope. The craggy,

Harad Road Curving East and South~
   Leading from Gondor to the distant Haradwaith, this dirt road 
is unmarked by patrols of soldiers or the travelings of farmers, 
though on occasion distant shadows can be seen far away in the 
horizon as the path leads east and south. The Southern lands of 
the Ithilien spill off the road, leading westward in to a sparse 
forest of firs, cedars and spruces. East, the bleak shards of

grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly from

wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds and moss,
an old, dried up well.

   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby

the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the south,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

A Rocky Hill~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

Stony Slopes Above Fir-Populated Woodlands~
   Toweringly large evergreens climb high in to the sky here, 
nearly as high as the stalwart, rocky ledges of the northern Emyn
Arnen that cast a noon shadow over this rocky slope. The craggy,

Etched in to the predominately stone ground here are innumerable
little gullies that fill with water when rain descends from the

plains and desolate foothills before a range of black mountains
lie, and to the distant west is the wide Anduin River.

An Small Clearing Beneath the Rising Cliffs of the Emyn Arnen~
   Wide spaces rule between the massive trees of fir, cedar and 
spruce that grow in this thin woodland, the main obstacle to 
travel through the forest not the vegetation but the rolling 
ground and occasional stone that juts out of the undergrowth. A 
small clearing in the woods sits under the shadow of the rising 
cliffs of the Emyn Arnen. The terrain gradually slopes down to 
the east, where an old road lies. 
   The remains of a small burnt cabin sit within the clearing. 
Skirting around the burnt cabin a small dirt trail to an 
encampment. You notice you can 'enter camp' from this point.

Harad Road Running North and South Past an Encampment~

is unmarked by patrols of soldiers or the travelings of farmers, 
though on occasion distant shadows can be seen far away in the 
horizon as the path leads north and south. The Southern lands of 
the Ithilien spill off the road, leading westward in to a sparse 
forest of firs, cedars and spruces. East, the bleak shards of 
the Ephel Duath stand.

Grassy Fields by a Burnt-Out Farm~
   Perhaps once the site of tilled fields and tended farms, these
plains of South Ithilien are now bleak and home to only tall
grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly from
the distant black mountains eastward to the western horizon are
the fractured remainders of buildings past; the odd, blackened
wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds and moss,
an old, dried up well.

sloped plain, the flat fields offering one a fine view of the
major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the south,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

A Rocky Expanse~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

Overgrown Grassy Fields in the Shadow of the Ephel Duath~
   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown,
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

A Tall Pale Hill~
   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby 
and wiry bushes, and some stretches of pale grass that bows in 
the wind. More often than not, great gusts of air blow down from 
the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the mighty 
Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

growths and small valley drops, covered in a coating of yellow 
grass. The occasional animal stalks through the area, though 
most common are circles of soaring birds high in the air, 
drifting on the winds that blow across South Ithilien. To the 
west, the vast, dry plains of Gondor's hither lands stretch.

here, this land a bumpy, rocky spit of land situated before the
steep ascent of the mountains to the east and the softer,

to be seen here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make
their homes in the craggy lips and caves visible on the surface

up between fissures of rock periodically in the area, the density
of vegetation growing progressively thicker in to a light forest
southward. Green needles from the trees litter the area about
their trunks, providing a further hazard underfoot for those 
climbing across the rugged terrain here.

Stony, Mountainous Ground in the Shadow of a Cliff~
   The sheer, chalk-white cliff walls of the Emyn Arnen jut out
far above South Ithilien just a short distance to the north, and
here the land descends rapidly as it heads south in a series of
rocky, bumpy falls, headed straight in to a thin forest of 
spruces, cedars and firs. Amidst the rocky ground, the occasional
knot of trees grows high in the chill, mountain air, as can be
seen the odd large animal track.

Windy, Sparse Woodlands in the Shadow of Emyn Arnen~
   Toweringly large evergreens climb high in to the sky here, 
nearly as high as the stalwart, rocky ledges of the northern Emyn
Arnen that cast a noon shadow over this rocky slope. The craggy,
weather-scored rocks of this slope rise and fall, but a clear 
descent down to the southern evergreen forest is present here.
Etched in to the predominately stone ground here are innumerable
little gullies that fill with water when rain descends from the

that flows to the west of here, under a short drop off a rocky

somewhat secure climb north and south along the river short, or
back to the Emyn Arnen to the east.

far overhead, their needle leaves a bright, grassy green at all

otherwise the forest is quiet, devoid even of birdsong.

grasslands linger before the mighty Ephel Duath, a myriad of

farmhouses set on distant hillocks. North and south the road 
progresses, far beyond what the eye can hope to see.

major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the south,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown,
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that

of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat

face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

the lands of Mordor. No human habitation is visible this close

Amongst the Cedars of the Forest~
   Flaky-barked spruces grow up out of the rough sloped woodlands 
here, their whorled branches stretching off, free of contact 
from the spaced cedars and firs that likewise dominate this 
section of South Ithilien. In some seasons, cones grow copiously 
upon the branches of firs, while in others they litter the ground 
along with the carpet of green leaf-needles. The ground is firm 
underfoot, with the occasional turf of grass or bush growing.

In the Midst of the Coniferious Ithilien Forest~
   Wide spaces rule between the massive trees of fir, cedar and 
spruce that grow in this thin woodland, the main obstacle to 
travel through the forest not the vegetation but the rolling 
ground and occasional stone that juts out of the undergrowth. A 
terrain gradually slopes down westward, where the broad river 
Anduin can be seen through the trees of the forest.

Sloping Woodland Terrain~
   The bumpy ground of this thin woodland slopes gently downwards 
to the west and south, but enough rocky rises and shifts of the 
earth make it far from a smooth descent. Massive cedars rise up 
far overhead, their needle leaves a bright, grassy green at all 
times of the year, and spaced between them are smaller, 
cone-shaped firs. Even with the undergrowth of bushes and fallen 
trunks, the vegetation here is light enough to allow one to 
easily walk past the trees.

tallest of men. The occasional small animal can be seen to dart 
up the gnarled, wrinkled bark of the cedars and firs, but 
otherwise the forest is quiet, devoid even of birdsong.

there. Through the loose trees, the chalky white cliffs of the 
Emyn Arnen can be seen to the north, and the black mountains of 
the Ephel Duath far to the east. From the undergrowth the 
occasional rock juts forth, covered in moss and small shoots.

lands of South Ithilien, broken every now and again by a grouping 
of peasant cottages or orchids of fruit bearing trees. The 
farmlands continue for some distance, but surrounding it is a 
thin forest of firs, spruces and cedars that roll down from Emyn 
Arnen to the north. 
   To the north and west, the farmlands slack off, the tall trees

through the undergrowth. Elsewhere, farmers work the land, but 
are careful to keep a safe distance from any outsiders that may 
travel along the rickety dirt paths that cut through the fief. 
   The northern edge of the fields are marked by a quick increase 
in altitude, hilly woodlands rising up to meet Emyn Arnen.

that have made numerous cottages to live in as they tend the rows 
of crops that grow in plentifully here. During the night, the 
only lights are those that twinkle in the distant fort that sits 
above the fief, to the south-west.

Path Running Straight North and South~

here through South Ithilien, little more than a narrow depression 
of land, as if once an ancient river ran along this course. To 
the east of the road, bleak plains and distant mountains rise up, 
while the western edge is bordered by a thin woodland. Long 
wagon ruts form the boundaries of this haphazard road.

Gently Sloping Grassy Fields by a Road~
   From east to west the South Ithilien rolls down in a gently
sloped plain, the flat fields offering one a fine view of the
major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the south,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

A Rocky Heath~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

Overgrown Grassy Fields in Southern Ithilien~
   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown,
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

A Fire-Gutted Farmhouse in Grassy Fields~
   Perhaps once the site of tilled fields and tended farms, these
plains of South Ithilien are now bleak and home to only tall
grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly from
the distant black mountains eastward to the western horizon are
the fractured remainders of buildings past; the odd, blackened
wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds and moss,
an old, dried up well.

Hilly Terrain Growing Steeper To The East~
   A thick growth of low lying bushes roams across the hills of 
South Ithilien that lie between the low lying plains to the west 
and the steep, thrusting, presence of the eastward mountains. 
Small animal life darts amongst the clustered clumps of 
vegetation, as well as the occasional larger predator lurking far 
from the distant plateau to the northwest, or the forest westward.

   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby

the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the mighty 
Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

smell of something old, a chill presence and the occasional fine
dust of soot.

they tumble down in to the deadly currents of the River Anduin
that flows to the west of here, under a short drop off a rocky
ledge. Fortunately for those traveling through here, large 
boulders and the occasional tree stump allows one to make a 
somewhat secure climb north and south along the river short, or
back to the Emyn Arnen to the east.

of the Ephel Duath that rise above the thin woodlands and barren
plains of South Ithilien, here, vibrant crops grow year round,
tended by the peasantry of Gondor that works the fields under the
watchful shadow of the south-westward fort. Spread between the
fields and pastures is the occasional green-watered dam.

Farmlands Bordering the Eastern and Northern Woodland~
   Tended fields grow bountiful crops in this section of South 
Ithilien, farmers seen tending to their flocks and produce, 
housed in the numerous daub and wattle cottages that populate the 
green, fallow hills. Numerous paths and wagon tracks cut across 
the cultivated lands, leading between the various farmsteads and 
towards the fortification located on a hill to the southwest. 
   The roads and paths stop to the north and east, not slipping 
between the giant trees of the hilly lands that grow there.

Tall, Rolling Fir Forest~
   Wide spaces rule between the massive trees of fir, cedar and 
spruce that grow in this thin woodland, the main obstacle to 
travel through the forest not the vegetation but the rolling 
ground and occasional stone that juts out of the undergrowth. A 
terrain gradually slopes down westward, where the broad river 
Anduin can be seen through the trees of the forest.

Curve in the Pathway, Running South and East~
   The unglamorous dirt trail that is Harad Road winds its way 
east and south through South Ithilien, leading past the borders 
of a coniferous forest westward, and hilly land becomes the black 
mountains of Mordor to the east. The occasional patch of grass 
grows across the road, at times the trail becomes 
indistinguishable from the scrubby plains that it cuts through.

Dirt Road Bending, Leading North and West~
   Leading from Gondor to the distant Haradwaith, this dirt road 
is unmarked by patrols of soldiers or the travelings of farmers, 
though on occasion distant shadows can be seen far away in the 
horizon as the path leads north and west. The Southern lands of 
the Ithilien spill off the road, leading westward in to a sparse 
forest of firs, cedars and spruces. East, the bleak shards of 
the Ephel Duath stand.

A Rocky Heath by a Road~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

Overgrown Grassy Fields East of a Road~
   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown,
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

A Burnt-Out Farm in the Grassy Fields of South Ithilien~
   Perhaps once the site of tilled fields and tended farms, these
plains of South Ithilien are now bleak and home to only tall
grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly from
the distant black mountains eastward to the western horizon are
the fractured remainders of buildings past; the odd, blackened
wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds and moss,
an old, dried up well.

Gently Sloping Grassy Fields in the Shadow of the Ephel Duath~
   From east to west the South Ithilien rolls down in a gently
sloped plain, the flat fields offering one a fine view of the
major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the south,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

Dusty, Wind-Beaten Hills Covered In Scrubby Bushes~
   The landscape here is damaged, bruised and beaten into hilly 
growths and small valley drops, covered in a coating of yellow 
grass. The occasional animal stalks through the area, though 
most common are circles of soaring birds high in the air, 
drifting on the winds that blow across South Ithilien. To the 
west, the vast, dry plains of Gondor's hither lands stretch.

A Steep Rocky Hill~
   The ground here is far from flat, rising in waves of hills and 
falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that 
spurts forth from the ground and is accompanied by a clustering 
of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
fields of South Ithilien westward, to the mighty, stark mountain 
face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

A Steep Hill of Hard Rock~
   The stark range of the Ephel Duath roams from north to south
here, this land a bumpy, rocky spit of land situated before the
steep ascent of the mountains to the east and the softer,
greener hillands of South Ithilien to the west. The only life
to be seen here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make
their homes in the craggy lips and caves visible on the surface
of the dark mountains.

Tree-Dotted Riverbank~

ground that marks the beginning of the River Anduin that cuts a
massive blue swathe through Gondor. Across the wide waters, 
unswimable by even the stoutest of individuals, the flowered 
fields of Lossarnach, the White City of Minas Tirith nestled
between the White Mountains, and the distant port of Pelargir can
all be seen.

Rocky Northset Shore~
   The surging waters of the Anduin flow swiftly from north to 
south to the west of here, having long eroded whatever shoreline 
may have originally been there, the land here instead a rock 
ledge jutting out a short distance above the chill river. The 
line of grass recedes a short distance from the lip of the 
overhang, revealing the stark, weather-beaten grey rock, and no
larger vegetation offers shelter from the cold winds that flow 
up from the Anduin.

Rivershore Sloping West to South~
   From east to west, the land quickly descends in a steep 
incline, forcing one to be careful in keeping their footing less
they tumble down in to the deadly currents of the River Anduin
that flows to the west of here, under a short drop off a rocky
ledge. Fortunately for those traveling through here, large 
boulders and the occasional tree stump allows one to make a 
somewhat secure climb north and south along the river short, or
back to the Emyn Arnen to the east.

In the Forest, Beneath Massive Cedars~
   The bumpy ground of this thin woodland slopes gently downwards 
to the west and south, but enough rocky rises and shifts of the 
earth make it far from a smooth descent. Massive cedars rise up 
far overhead, their needle leaves a bright, grassy green at all 
times of the year, and spaced between them are smaller, 
cone-shaped firs. Even with the undergrowth of bushes and fallen 
trunks, the vegetation here is light enough to allow one to 
easily walk past the trees.

The Silent Fir Forest~
   Ancient cedars, firs and spruces rise up from the needle 
covered floor of the woodlands, the trees well spaces apart from 
each other as they climb dozens of feet above the heads of the 
tallest of men. The occasional small animal can be seen to dart 
up the gnarled, wrinkled bark of the cedars and firs, but 
otherwise the forest is quiet, devoid even of birdsong.

At a Moss and Vine Covered Boulder in the Forest~
   Spruces and firs climb up high in to the sky in this thin 
woodland, slicing the sunlight in to broad ribbons to fall on the 
forest floor and the myriad of bushes and grasses that grow 
there. Through the loose trees, the chalky white cliffs of the 
Emyn Arnen can be seen to the north, and the black mountains of 
the Ephel Duath far to the east. From the undergrowth the 
occasional rock juts forth, covered in moss and small shoots.

   Fields left fallow, to grow only tall, green grasses, roam 
across this part of this small, South Ithilien fiefdom, small 
animals such as fieldmice and rabbits seen making their way 
through the undergrowth. Elsewhere, farmers work the land, but 
are careful to keep a safe distance from any outsiders that may 
travel along the rickety dirt paths that cut through the fief. 
   To the west, the green fields give way to tall trees that form 
a thin woodlands.

Ramshackle Village Path~
   A ramshackle path cuts from the southern portcullis to deeper 
north inside the tiny village, often cluttered by the livestock 
and ox-carts of farmers bringing their harvest in from the 
surrounding fields to sell, mill and slaughter. Underfoot, the 
path is nothing more than packed dirt, but is kept sturdy by the 
constant stream of villagers, soldiers and vagabonds alike that 
make their way along this road and through the gate, or in to 
their crude, flimsy huts. A thick ladder set against the western 
battlements allows one access up to them.

Wind-Swept Coniferous Woodland~
   The bumpy ground of this thin woodland slopes gently downwards 
to the west and south, but enough rocky rises and shifts of the 
earth make it far from a smooth descent. Massive cedars rise up 
far overhead, their needle leaves a bright, grassy green at all 
times of the year, and spaced between them are smaller, 
cone-shaped firs. Even with the undergrowth of bushes and fallen 
trunks, the vegetation here is light enough to allow one to 
easily walk past the trees.

Harad Road Running North and South~
   Above, the occasional branch hangs over the road from the thin
forest that stretches out westward, shading the otherwise bleak
Harad Road during the day. East, a small stretch of brown grasslands
linger before the mighty Ephel Duath, a myriad of smaller paths
branching off the Harad to lead to abandoned farmhouses set on
distant hillocks. North and south the road progresses, far beyond
what the eye can hope to see.

A Rocky Expanse in the Southern Ithilien~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

Overgrown Grassy Fields by a Wood~
   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown,
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

A Ring of Fire-Gutted Farmhouses Next to a Derelict Windmill~
   Perhaps once the site of tilled fields and tended farms, these
plains of South Ithilien are now bleak and home to only tall
grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly from
the distant black mountains eastward to the western horizon are
the fractured remainders of buildings past; the odd, blackened
wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds and moss,
an old, dried up well.

Gently Sloping Grassy Fields in the Shadow of the Ephel Duath~
   From east to west the South Ithilien rolls down in a gently
sloped plain, the flat fields offering one a fine view of the
major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the south,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

Hilly Terrain Occasionally Marked By Gnarled Trees~
   Travel through these hills is far from easy; the landscape 
climbs and falls, yet uniformly grows more steep and stark as it 
heads east to the towering, shard-like black mountains that mark 
the lands of Mordor. No human habitation is visible this close 
to dark border, but across the west the occasional fortified 
village or isolated farmhouse can be seen.

Steep, Unforgiving Foothills Nearing The Ephel Duath~
   A thick growth of low lying bushes roams across the hills of 
South Ithilien that lie between the low lying plains to the west 
and the steep, thrusting, presence of the eastward mountains. 
Small animal life darts amongst the clustered clumps of 
vegetation, as well as the occasional larger predator lurking far 
from the distant plateau to the northwest, or the forest westward.

   The hard grass that rolls in from the west quickly becomes 
even tougher rock under foot, a narrow plateau continuing before 
the unscaleable sides of the Ephel Duath tear up from the ground, 
ending so high in the sky that one must crane their neck back to 
view the splintered peaks in their malignant majesty. North and 
south the range continues without any apparent end.

   The towering, expansive mountain range grants the hard rock 
ground here a permanent shadow until past the noon of the day, 
the massive formation of volcanic rock blotting out the eastern 
horizon and the dark lands of Mordor that lies beneath. A jumble 
of large rocks and boulders is scattered along the edge of the 
Ephel Duath, pressed tight as the peaks turn from north to west 
here. A black spire of rock shoots out from the wall of 
mountains, the volcanic rock carved in to the shape of a tower 
complete with window slits.

Airy Evergreen Forest~
   Flaky-barked spruces grow up out of the rough sloped woodlands 
here, their whorled branches stretching off, free of contact 
from the spaced cedars and firs that likewise dominate this 
section of South Ithilien. In some seasons, cones grow copiously 
upon the branches of firs, while in others they litter the ground 
along with the carpet of green leaf-needles. The ground is firm 
underfoot, with the occasional turf of grass or bush growing.

Uneven Terrain Through the Woodlands~
   Wide spaces rule between the massive trees of fir, cedar and 
spruce that grow in this thin woodland, the main obstacle to 
travel through the forest not the vegetation but the rolling 
ground and occasional stone that juts out of the undergrowth. A 
terrain gradually slopes down westward, where the broad river 
Anduin can be seen through the trees of the forest.

Forest Floor Littered with a Felled Tree~
   The bumpy ground of this thin woodland slopes gently downwards 
to the west and south, but enough rocky rises and shifts of the 
earth make it far from a smooth descent. Massive cedars rise up 
far overhead, their needle leaves a bright, grassy green at all 
times of the year, and spaced between them are smaller, 
cone-shaped firs. Even with the undergrowth of bushes and fallen 
trunks, the vegetation here is light enough to allow one to 
easily walk past the trees.

   The normal rolling landscape of South Ithilien smooths to a

of crops that grow in plentifully here. During the night, the 
only lights are those that twinkle in the distant fort that sits

Fertile Farmlands South of a Fort~
   Tended fields grow bountiful crops in this section of South 
Ithilien, farmers seen tending to their flocks and produce, 
housed in the numerous daub and wattle cottages that populate the 
green, fallow hills. Numerous paths and wagon tracks cut across 
the cultivated lands, leading between the various farmsteads and 
towards the fortification located on a hill to the north.

Tilled Lands Northeast of a Forest~
   Long rows of tilled earth bear crops year round in these lush
lands of South Ithilien, broken every now and again by a grouping
of peasant cottages or orchids of fruit bearing trees. The 
farmlands continue for some distance, but surrounding it is a
thin forest of firs, spruces and cedars that roll down from Emyn 
Arnen to the north.

animals such as fieldmice and rabbits seen making their way 
through the undergrowth. Elsewhere, farmers work the land, but 
are careful to keep a safe distance from any outsiders that may 
travel along the rickety dirt paths that cut through the fief. 
   To the east, the long trail of Harad road can be seen through 
a pair of tall trees.

A Twist in Harad Road Heading East and South~
   Leading from Gondor to the distant Haradwaith, this dirt road 
is unmarked by patrols of soldiers or the travelings of farmers, 
though on occasion distant shadows can be seen far away in the 
horizon as the path leads east and south. The Southern lands of 
the Ithilien spill off the road, leading westward in to a sparse 
forest of firs, cedars and spruces. East, the bleak shards of 
the Ephel Duath stand. West, a smaller trail branches off to 
lead in to some farmlands, while large trees overhang the trail 
eastward.

Curve in the Road, North and West, Passing Through a Forest~
   The dusty path of the Harad road continues north and west here 
through South Ithilien, little more than a narrow depression of 
land, as if once an ancient river ran along this course. To the 
east of the road, bleak plains and distant mountains rise up, 
while the western edge is bordered by a thin woodland. Long 
wagon ruts form the boundaries of this haphazard road. To the 
immediate east, however, a thin forest rises up, the trail 
cutting underneath tall trees.

tallest of men. The occasional small animal can be seen to dart 
up the gnarled, wrinkled bark of the cedars and firs, but 
otherwise the forest is quiet, devoid even of birdsong.

The Burnt Remains of Buildings in Grassy Fields~
   Perhaps once the site of tilled fields and tended farms, these
plains of South Ithilien are now bleak and home to only tall
grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly from
the distant black mountains eastward to the western horizon are
the fractured remainders of buildings past; the odd, blackened
wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds and moss,
an old, dried up well.

Gently Sloping Grassy Fields in the Shadow of the Ephel Duath~
   From east to west the South Ithilien rolls down in a gently
sloped plain, the flat fields offering one a fine view of the
major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the south,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

A Rocky Expanse by the Hills~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

Barren, Hard-Soiled Foothills~
   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby 
and wiry bushes, and some stretches of pale grass that bows in 
the wind. More often than not, great gusts of air blow down from 
the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the mighty 
Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

grass. The occasional animal stalks through the area, though 
most common are circles of soaring birds high in the air, 
drifting on the winds that blow across South Ithilien. To the 
west, the vast, dry plains of Gondor's hither lands stretch.

A Barren Area next to the Towering Ephel Duath~
   Howling wind funnels down the notches and gaps in the
splintered peaks of the black mountains of Mordor that burst from
the ground to the east, a short run of increasingly rocky and
steep terrain rising up to them. Along with the wind comes the
smell of something old, a chill presence and the occasional fine
dust of soot.

   The stark range of the Ephel Duath roams from north to south
here, this land a bumpy, rocky spit of land situated before the
steep ascent of the mountains to the east and the softer,
greener hillands of South Ithilien to the west. The only life
to be seen here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make
their homes in the craggy lips and caves visible on the surface
of the dark mountains.

On the Shore of a Brisk River~
   Grainy, dirty sand marks the border between the River Anduin
and the broad plains of South Ithilien here, much of the western
horizon occupied by the massive stream that forms the west-most
boundary of these lands of Gondor. The area here is marked by the
tall, untamed vegetation, and the occasional large rock that 
rises above the knee high grasses. The winds that rise from the
waters are chill, and the gurgle of running water never stills.

Grassy Slope of the Anduin~
   The farmlands of South Ithilien come to a gradual end as the
ground slips beneath the brisk waters of the River Anduin west,
the lands about the riverbank clear of any cultivation and home 
to nothing more than a flourishing of shoreside trees and tall 
grasses. Just as the terrain slopes down from east to west, so
does it fall gradually from the distant white plateau of Emyn
Arnen north to a ford of rivers southward.

Shore of the River Anduin~
   West, the waters of the River Anduin run, far from the 
frenzied rush from which the currents surge to the north, but 
still fast enough to easily drag under all but the greatest of
swimmers. The shore here of loose dirt descends slowly under the
cold flow, the occasional coniferous tree sprouting out along the
riverbank or large rock rising out a short distance in the water.
The opposite bank of the river lies far to the west, barely 
visible against the course of the river.

tended by the peasantry of Gondor that works the fields under the

forest floor and the myriad of bushes and grasses that grow 
there. Through the loose trees, the chalky white cliffs of the 
Emyn Arnen can be seen to the north, and the black mountains of 
the Ephel Duath far to the east. From the undergrowth the 
occasional rock juts forth, covered in moss and small shoots.

Irregular Growth of Trees South and East of a Trail~
   Wide spaces rule between the massive trees of fir, cedar and 
spruce that grow in this thin woodland, the main obstacle to 
travel through the forest not the vegetation but the rolling 
ground and occasional stone that juts out of the undergrowth. A 
terrain gradually slopes down westward, where the broad river 
Anduin can be seen through the trees of the forest.

Widespaced Forest~
   The bumpy ground of this thin woodland slopes gently downwards 
to the west and south, but enough rocky rises and shifts of the 
earth make it far from a smooth descent. Massive cedars rise up 
far overhead, their needle leaves a bright, grassy green at all 
times of the year, and spaced between them are smaller, 
cone-shaped firs. Even with the undergrowth of bushes and fallen 
trunks, the vegetation here is light enough to allow one to 
easily walk past the trees.

In a Lush Evergreen Forest~
   Spruces and firs climb up high in to the sky in this thin 
woodland, slicing the sunlight in to broad ribbons to fall on the 
forest floor and the myriad of bushes and grasses that grow 
there. Through the loose trees, the chalky white cliffs of the 
Emyn Arnen can be seen to the north-est, and the black mountains 
of the Ephel Duath to the east. From the undergrowth the 
occasional rock juts forth, covered in moss and small shoots.

A Rocky Expanse Between the Hills and a Wood~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

Overgrown Grassy Fields by the Hills~
   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown,
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

Desolate, Barren Foothills West Of The Ephel Duath~
   The ground here is far from flat, rising in waves of hills and 
falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that 
spurts forth from the ground and is accompanied by a clustering 
of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
fields of South Ithilien westward, to the mighty, stark mountain 
face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

   Travel through these hills is far from easy; the landscape 
climbs and falls, yet uniformly grows more steep and stark as it 
heads east to the towering, shard-like black mountains that mark 
the lands of Mordor. No human habitation is visible this close 
to dark border, but across the west the occasional fortified 
village or isolated farmhouse can be seen.

Sloping Dirt Bank Leading West in to a River~
   West, the waters of the River Anduin run, far from the 
frenzied rush from which the currents surge to the north, but 
still fast enough to easily drag under all but the greatest of
swimmers. The shore here of loose dirt descends slowly under the
cold flow, the occasional coniferous tree sprouting out along the
riverbank or large rock rising out a short distance in the water.
The opposite bank of the river lies far to the west, barely 
visible against the course of the river.

Fertile, Rolling Hills~
   The normal rolling landscape of South Ithilien smooths to a 
flat, fertile stretch of land, occupied by hardworking farmers 
that have made numerous cottages to live in as they tend the rows
of crops that grow in plentifully here. During the night, the 
only lights are those that twinkle in the distant fort that sits 
above the fief, to the southeast.

tended by the peasantry of Gondor that works the fields under the

Ithilien, farmers seen tending to their flocks and produce, 
housed in the numerous daub and wattle cottages that populate the 
green, fallow hills. Numerous paths and wagon tracks cut across 
the cultivated lands, leading between the various farmsteads and 
towards the fortification located on a hill to the southwest.

   Long rows of tilled earth bear crops year round in these lush
lands of South Ithilien, broken every now and again by a grouping
of peasant cottages or orchids of fruit bearing trees. The 
farmlands continue for some distance, but surrounding it to the 
north, east and south is a thin forest of firs, spruces and 
cedars that roll down from Emyn Arnen to the north.

through South Ithilien, little more than a narrow depression of 
land, as if once an ancient river ran along this course. To the 
east of the road, a dry forest of spruces, firs and pines rise 
up, just as they do to the west, large branches hanging over the 
road and casting the area in a perpetual gloom at all times but 
the height of the day. Long wagon ruts form the boundaries of 
this haphazard road.

grasslands linger before the mighty Ephel Duath, a myriad of 
smaller paths branching off the Harad to lead to abandoned
farmhouses set on distant hillocks. North and west the road 
progresses, far beyond what the eye can hope to see. At this 
point on the trail, the black mountain range is obscured by the 
tall evergreen treetops that rise up before it.

woodlands and a river.

horizon occupied by the massive stream that forms the west-most
boundary of these lands of Gondor. The area here is marked by the
tall, untamed vegetation, and the occasional large rock that

waters are chill, and the gurgle of running water never stills.

the lands about the riverbank clear of any cultivation and home

grasses. Just as the terrain slopes down from east to west, so
does it fall gradually from the distant white plateau of Emyn
Arnen north to a ford of rivers southward.

New Room~
   Tended fields grow bountiful crops in this section of South 
Ithilien, farmers seen tending to their flocks and produce, 
housed in the numerous daub and wattle cottages that populate the 
green, fallow hills. Numerous paths and wagon tracks cut across 
the cultivated lands, leading between the various farmsteads and 
towards the fortification located on a hill to the <direction>.

Fertile Orchards and Fields~
   Long rows of tilled earth bear crops year round in these lush
lands of South Ithilien, broken every now and again by a grouping
of peasant cottages or orchards of fruit bearing trees. The 
farmlands continue for some distance, but surrounding it to the 
north, east and south is a thin forest of firs, spruces and 
cedars that roll down from Emyn Arnen to the north.

Fertile Fieldlands~
   Fields left fallow, to grow only tall, green grasses, roam
across this part of this small, South Ithilien fiefdom, small
animals such as fieldmice and rabbits seen making their way 
through the undergrowth. Elsewhere, farmers work the land, but
are careful to keep a safe distance from any outsiders that may
travel along the rickety dirt paths that cut through the fief.

Amidst the Spruces and Firs of the Forest~
   The bumpy ground of this thin woodland slopes gently downwards 
to the west and south, but enough rocky rises and shifts of the 
earth make it far from a smooth descent. Massive cedars rise up 
far overhead, their needle leaves a bright, grassy green at all 
times of the year, and spaced between them are smaller, 
cone-shaped firs. Even with the undergrowth of bushes and fallen 
trunks, the vegetation here is light enough to allow one to 
easily walk past the trees.

A Sparse Evergreen Forest~
   Spruces and firs climb up high in to the sky in this thin 
woodland, slicing the sunlight in to broad ribbons to fall on the 
forest floor and the myriad of bushes and grasses that grow 
there. Through the loose trees, the chalky white cliffs of the 
Emyn Arnen can be seen to the north, and the black mountains of 
the Ephel Duath far to the east. From the undergrowth the 
occasional rock juts forth, covered in moss and small shoots.

A Lush Coniferous Forest~
   Flaky-barked spruces grow up out of the rough sloped woodlands 
here, their whorled branches stretching off, free of contact 
from the spaced cedars and firs that likewise dominate this 
section of South Ithilien. In some seasons, cones grow copiously 
upon the branches of firs, while in others they litter the ground 
along with the carpet of green leaf-needles. The ground is firm 
underfoot, with the occasional turf of grass or bush growing.

A Thick Evergreen Forest~
   Ancient cedars, firs and spruces rise up from the needle

each other as they climb dozens of feet above the heads of the 
tallest of men. The occasional small animal can be seen to dart 
up the gnarled, wrinkled bark of the cedars and firs, but 
otherwise the forest is quiet, devoid even of birdsong.

Dirt Path Through the Trees, Leading North and South~
   Leading from Gondor to the distant Haradwaith, this dirt road 
is unmarked by patrols of soldiers or the travelings of farmers, 
though on occasion distant shadows can be seen far away in the 
horizon as the path leads north and south. The Southern lands of 
the Ithilien spill off the road, leading westward in to a sparse 
forest of firs, cedars and spruces. East, the bleak shards of 
the Ephel Duath stand, and before them a light forest of 
evergreens.

Overgrown Grassy Fields by a Heath~
   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown,
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

Gently Sloping Grassy Fields in the Shadow of the Ephel Duath~

sloped plain, the flat fields offering one a fine view of the
major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the south,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

Foothills Sloping Downward To The Western Plains ~

growths and small valley drops, covered in a coating of yellow 
grass. The occasional animal stalks through the area, though 
most common are circles of soaring birds high in the air, 
drifting on the winds that blow across South Ithilien. To the 
west, the vast, dry plains of Gondor's hither lands stretch.

falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that 
spurts forth from the ground and is accompanied by a clustering 
of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
fields of South Ithilien westward, to the mighty, stark mountain 
face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

Wind-Blasted Rock Underhill~
   Howling wind funnels down the notches and gaps in the

steep terrain rising up to them. Along with the wind comes the
smell of something old, a chill presence and the occasional fine
dust of soot.

Amidst a Few Twisting Trees Set by the River~
   The farmlands of South Ithilien come to a gradual end as the
ground slips beneath the brisk waters of the River Anduin west,
the lands about the riverbank clear of any cultivation and home 
to nothing more than a flourishing of shoreside trees and tall 
grasses. Just as the terrain slopes down from east to west, so
does it fall gradually from the distant white plateau of Emyn
Arnen north to a ford of rivers southward.

Rock-Dotted River Bank~
   West, the waters of the River Anduin run, far from the 
frenzied rush from which the currents surge to the north, but 
still fast enough to easily drag under all but the greatest of
swimmers. The shore here of loose dirt descends slowly under the
cold flow, the occasional coniferous tree sprouting out along the
riverbank or large rock rising out a short distance in the water.
The opposite bank of the river lies far to the west, barely 
visible against the course of the river.

Gentle Farmland~
   While the eastern horizon is dominated by the bleak peaks
of the Ephel Duath that rise above the thin woodlands and barren
plains of South Ithilien, here, vibrant crops grow year round,
tended by the peasantry of Gondor that works the fields under the
watchful shadow of the north-eastward fort. Spread between the
fields and pastures is the occasional green-watered dam.

there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains

plains of South Ithilien are now bleak and home to only tall
grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly from
the distant black mountains eastward to the western horizon are
the fractured remainders of buildings past; the odd, blackened
wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds and moss,
an old, dried up well.

   Travel through these hills is far from easy; the landscape

village or isolated farmhouse can be seen.

Gusty Foothills Approaching A Wall Of Mountains~
   A thick growth of low lying bushes roams across the hills of 
South Ithilien that lie between the low lying plains to the west 
and the steep, thrusting, presence of the eastward mountains. 
Small animal life darts amongst the clustered clumps of 
vegetation, as well as the occasional larger predator lurking far 
from the distant plateau to the northwest, or the forest westward.

A Stony, Bare Plateau Before The Ephel Duath~
   The stark range of the Ephel Duath roams from north to south
here, this land a bumpy, rocky spit of land situated before the
steep ascent of the mountains to the east and the softer,
greener hillands of South Ithilien to the west. The only life
to be seen here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make
their homes in the craggy lips and caves visible on the surface
of the dark mountains.

Littoral Land of the Anduin~
   The farmlands of South Ithilien come to a gradual end as the
ground slips beneath the brisk waters of the River Anduin west,
the lands about the riverbank clear of any cultivation and home 
to nothing more than a flourishing of shoreside trees and tall 
grasses. Just as the terrain slopes down from east to west, so
does it fall gradually from the distant white plateau of Emyn
Arnen north to a ford of rivers southward.

South of the Great River~
   North, the waters of the River Anduin run, far from the 
frenzied rush from which the currents surge to the north, but 
still fast enough to easily drag under all but the greatest of
swimmers. The shore here of loose dirt descends slowly under the
cold flow, the occasional coniferous tree sprouting out along the
riverbank or large rock rising out a short distance in the water.
The opposite bank of the river lies far to the west, barely 
visible against the course of the river.

Riverside of the Anduin Twisting North and West~
   Grainy, dirty sand marks the border between the River Anduin
and the broad plains of South Ithilien here, much of the western
horizon occupied by the massive stream that forms the west-most
boundary of these lands of Gondor. The area here is marked by the
tall, untamed vegetation, and the occasional large rock that 
rises above the knee high grasses. The winds that rise from the
waters are chill, and the gurgle of running water never stills.

Tended Fields, North of a Trail~
   Tended fields grow bountiful crops in this section of South 
Ithilien, farmers seen tending to their flocks and produce, 
housed in the numerous daub and wattle cottages that populate the 
green, fallow hills. Numerous paths and wagon tracks cut across 
the cultivated lands, leading between the various farmsteads and 
towards the fortification located on a hill to the southwest.

   Long rows of tilled earth bear crops year round in these lush
lands of South Ithilien, broken every now and again by a grouping
of peasant cottages or orchards of fruit bearing trees. The 
farmlands continue for some distance, but surrounding it to the 
north, east and south is a thin forest of firs, spruces and 
cedars that roll down from Emyn Arnen to the north.

   Fields left fallow, to grow only tall, green grasses, roam

animals such as fieldmice and rabbits seen making their way 
through the undergrowth. Elsewhere, farmers work the land, but
are careful to keep a safe distance from any outsiders that may
travel along the rickety dirt paths that cut through the fief.

flat, fertile stretch of land, occupied by hardworking farmers 
that have made numerous cottages to live in as they tend the rows
of crops that grow in plentifully here. During the night, the 
only lights are those that twinkle in the distant fort that sits 
above the fief, to the northwest.

Evergreen Forest, Southeast of Fields~
   The bumpy ground of this thin woodland slopes gently downwards 
to the west and south, but enough rocky rises and shifts of the 
earth make it far from a smooth descent. Massive cedars rise up 
far overhead, their needle leaves a bright, grassy green at all 
times of the year, and spaced between them are smaller, 
cone-shaped firs. Even with the undergrowth of bushes and fallen 
trunks, the vegetation here is light enough to allow one to 
easily walk past the trees.

Swerving Trail Running South and East~
   Leading from Gondor to the distant Haradwaith, this dirt road 
is unmarked by patrols of soldiers or the travelings of farmers, 
though on occasion distant shadows can be seen far away in the 
horizon as the path leads east and south. The Southern lands of 
the Ithilien spill off the road, leading westward in to a sparse 
forest of firs, cedars and spruces. East, the bleak shards of 
the Ephel Duath stand.

here through South Ithilien, little more than a narrow depression 
of land, as if once an ancient river ran along this course. To 
the east of the road, bleak plains and distant mountains rise up, 
while the western edge is bordered by a thin woodland. Long 
wagon ruts form the boundaries of this haphazard road.

major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the south,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

the Ephel Duath that dominates the eastern horizon, to the south. 
A few struggling trees, mostly lone pines, even less boasting a 
scrubby patch of grass about them, crawl out of the fissures of 
black rock here. Apart from the occasional bird nesting in the 
branches of the trees, no animals are to be seen here.

slopes of rock home to nothing. In some places on the steep 
incline to the peak, dirt and even grass have grown over the 
black rock of the mountains, but most of the climbs is nothing 
more than overlapping ledges of rock, and the occasional 
individual boulder or light scattering of pebbles.

   Perhaps once the site of tilled fields and tended farms, these
plains of South Ithilien are now bleak and home to only tall
grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly from
the distant black mountains eastward to the western horizon are
the fractured remainders of buildings past; the odd, blackened
wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds and moss,
an old, dried up well.

Desolate Barrens of the Ithilien~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby

the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the mighty 
Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

tallest of men. The occasional small animal can be seen to dart 
up the gnarled, wrinkled bark of the cedars and firs, but 
otherwise the forest is quiet, devoid even of birdsong.

A Bend in the Harad Road, Leading East and South~
   Above, the occasional branch hangs over the road from the thin
forest that stretches out westward, shading the otherwise bleak
Harad Road during the day. East, a small stretch of brown grasslands
linger before the mighty Ephel Duath, a myriad of smaller paths
branching off the Harad to lead to abandoned farmhouses set on
distant hillocks. North and south the road progresses, far beyond
what the eye can hope to see.

Jagged Road Heading North and West~
   The unglamorous dirt trail that is Harad Road winds its way 
north and west through South Ithilien, leading past the borders 
of a coniferous forest westward, and hilly land becomes the black 
mountains of Mordor to the east. The occasional patch of grass 
grows across the road, at times the trail becomes 
indistinguishable from the scrubby plains that it cuts through.

Sloping Plains~
   From east to west the South Ithilien rolls down in a gently
sloped plain, the flat fields offering one a fine view of the
major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the east,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

   The ground underfoot is rocky and hard, the Ithilien here 
forming up to a circular shard of black peaks, an off-shoot of 
the Ephel Duath that dominates the eastern horizon, to the 
south-east. A few struggling trees, mostly lone pines, even less 
boasting a scrubby patch of grass about them, crawl out of the 
fissures of black rock here. Apart from the occasional bird 
nesting in the branches of the trees, no animals are to be seen 
here.

   In the southern skyline a circular spire of jagged mountains 
forms the outer wall of the township of Tur Edendor, the bleak 
slopes of rock home to nothing. In some places on the steep 
incline to the peak, dirt and even grass have grown over the 
black rock of the mountains, but most of the climbs is nothing 
more than overlapping ledges of rock, and the occasional 
individual boulder or light scattering of pebbles.

ring that trails off from similar, dark, range to the east. 
West, the evergreen tops of a distant forest can be seen, and 
beyond it another great mass of mountains, this time their slopes 
a chalky white in colour.

bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

Ithilien Fields Beneath the Shadows of Two Ranges of Peaks~
   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown,
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

   The ground here is far from flat, rising in waves of hills and 
falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that 
spurts forth from the ground and is accompanied by a clustering 
of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
fields of South Ithilien westward, to the mighty, stark mountain 
face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

Fallow Tor-lands~
   Travel through these hills is far from easy; the landscape 
climbs and falls, yet uniformly grows more steep and stark as it

the lands of Mordor. No human habitation is visible this close 
to dark border, but across the west the occasional fortified 
village or isolated farmhouse can be seen.

   The hard grass that rolls in from the west quickly becomes 
even tougher rock under foot, a narrow plateau continuing before 
the unscaleable sides of the Ephel Duath tear up from the ground, 
ending so high in the sky that one must crane their neck back to 
view the splintered peaks in their malignant majesty. North and 
south the range continues without any apparent end.

Dirt Trail Ending at the Riverside~
   A hard-packed dirt trail leading in from the east comes to 
an end along the shoreline of a wide flowing river, at the foot 
of a white, stone, bluff. The bluff rises gently to a height of 
three men as it extends westward into the river. Several rickety 
wooden piers can be seen extending from the rocky bluff out into 
the cold, blue water at various directions. Grainy, dirty sand 
marks the boundry between the waters of the great river and the 
broad plains of South Ithilien to the north and south of the 
rocky bluff.

outside of a small Hamlet. The surface of the trail is hard 
packed dirt with deep wagon wheel ruts scaring it. Scorched 
stones have been stacked neatly on either side of the trail 
forming short walls. To the east, several thatched roofed 
structures can be seen. A wide river can be seen off to the

eastern horizon, the jagged peaks of the Ephel Duath rise above 
the land in grim contrast to the fertile earth here. However, no 
farmers are seen tending to the fields. Just to the west there 
are numerous daub and wattle cottages that populate the green, 
fallow hills.

rise of mountains a short distance before the Ephel Duath. Two 
lines of heavy, off-white stones mark the borders of this path, 
set a good dozen paces across, the centre plain packed dirt. Off 
the north of the trail a woodlands quickly rises up, while to the 
south farmlands are visible.

Path Twisting West and South~

cliffs of the Emyn Arnen can be seen, and the light woodlands 
spreads out from their base.

A Thin Evergreen Forest~
   The bumpy ground of this thin woodland slopes gently downwards 
to the west and south, but enough rocky rises and shifts of the 
earth make it far from a smooth descent. Massive cedars rise up 
far overhead, their needle leaves a bright, grassy green at all 
times of the year, and spaced between them are smaller, 
cone-shaped firs. Even with the undergrowth of bushes and fallen 
trunks, the vegetation here is light enough to allow one to 
easily walk past the trees.

otherwise the forest is quiet, devoid even of birdsong.

there. Through the loose trees, the chalky white cliffs of the 
Emyn Arnen can be seen to the north, and the black mountains of

A Large Burnt Tree Stands Alone in a Clearing Within an Evergreen Forest~
   Flaky-barked spruces grow up out of the rough sloped woodlands 
here, their whorled branches stretching off, free of contract 
from the spaced cedars and firs that likewise dominate this 
section of South Ithilien. In some seasons, cones grow copiously 
upon the branches of firs, while in others they litter the ground 
along with the carpet of green leaf-needles. The ground is firm 
underfoot, with the occasional turf of grass or bush growing. 
   Within the clearing, a lone tree trunk stands, it's branches 
missing and its skin burnt. A sprawling encampment opens here 
allowing you to 'enter' the 'camp' from this vantage point.

while the western edge is bordered by a thin woodland. Long

Foothills Between Two Mountains~
   Perhaps once the site of tilled fields and tended farms, these
plains of South Ithilien are now bleak and home to only tall
grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly from
the distant black mountains eastward to the western horizon are
the fractured remainders of buildings past; the odd, blackened
wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds and moss,
an old, dried up well.

major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the west,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

Small animal life darts amongst the clustered clumps of 
vegetation, as well as the occasional larger predator lurking far 
from the distant plateau to the northwest, or the forest westward.

Barren Ranges of Hills~
   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby 
and wiry bushes, and some stretches of pale grass that bows in 
the wind. More often than not, great gusts of air blow down from 
the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the mighty 
Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

Before a Mine in the Mountain Side~
   Howling wind funnels down the notches and gaps in the
splintered peaks of the black mountains of Mordor that burst from
the ground to the east, a short run of increasingly rocky and
steep terrain rising up to them. Along with the wind comes the
smell of something old, a chill presence and the occasional fine
dust of soot.

Farmlands Along the Anduin River~
   The farmlands of South Ithilien come to a gradual end as the
ground slips beneath the brisk waters of the River Anduin west,
the lands about the riverbank clear of any cultivation and home 
to nothing more than a flourishing of shoreside trees and tall 
grasses. Just as the terrain slopes down from east to west, so
does it fall gradually from the distant white plateau of Emyn
Arnen north to a ford of rivers southward.

Along the Shoreline of the Anduin River~
   West, the waters of the River Anduin run, far from the 
frenzied rush from which the currents surge to the north, but 
still fast enough to easily drag under all but the greatest of
swimmers. The shore here of loose dirt descends slowly under the
cold flow, the occasional coniferous tree sprouting out along the
riverbank or large rock rising out a short distance in the water.
The opposite bank of the river lies far to the west, barely 
visible against the course of the river.

fieldmice and rabbits seen making their way through the 
undergrowth. In the surrounding distances, some fields are 
plowed and sown along the rickety dirt paths that cut through the

ranges, the former by the white cliffs of the Emyn Arnen, the

Trails Leading North, East and South~
   This thin, nameless trail runs from the shores of the mighty 
Anduin that flows through Gondor to the west, aimed east at a 
rise of mountains a short distance before the Ephel Duath. Two 
lines of heavy, off-white stones mark the borders of this path, 
set a good dozen paces across, the centre plain packed dirt. Off 
the north of the trail a woodlands quickly rises up, while to the 
south farmlands are visible. Another, similar, trail branches 
off to the south, headed for a distant walled village.

tended; two lines boundary stones mark the edges, and the forest 
of firs and spruces to the north extend not a branch on to the 
road proper. Green grass grows abudantly about the edges of the 
trail, both north and south, in the latter direction extending 
some light farmlands and boggy ground.

spreads out from their base.

   Flaky-barked spruces grow up out of the rough sloped woodlands 
here, their whorled branches stretching off, free of contract 
from the spaced cedars and firs that likewise dominate this 
section of South Ithilien. In some seasons, cones grow copiously 
upon the branches of firs, while in others they litter the ground 
along with the carpet of green leaf-needles. The ground is firm 
underfoot, with the occasional turf of grass or bush growing.

east and south through South Ithilien, leading past the borders 
of a coniferous forest westward, and hilly land becomes the black 
mountains of Mordor to the east. The occasional patch of grass 
grows across the road, at times the trail becomes 
indistinguishable from the scrubby plains that it cuts through.

Harad Road Turning from North to West, Near an Encampment~
   Leading from Gondor to the distant Haradwaith, this dirt road 
is unmarked by patrols of soldiers or the travelings of farmers, 
though on occasion distant shadows can be seen far away in the 
horizon as the path leads north and west. The Southern lands of 
the Ithilien spill off the road, leading westward in to a sparse 
forest of firs, cedars and spruces. East, the bleak shards of 
the Ephel Duath stand, a paved trail leading up to a nearer ring 
of peaks leading off from the road here.

Paved Trail Leading East Towards a Spire of Rock~
   Whilst the ever-stretching Harad Road makes it way from the 
distant north to the distant south to the west, a paved trail 
looking to be well paved by the lack of weeds or plants growing 
along it leads from the Road, aimed eastward towards a circular 
spire of black, rocky mountains. Whilst the road here is quite 
flat, passing by some barren grasslands of southern Ithilien, it 
looks to soon become somewhat steep as it winds its way about the 
mountain. To the west, evergreens grow opposite the Harad Road.

A Murky Path Leading East up the Mountain~
   The cobbled path here leads straight from east to west, thick 
slabs of dusky black stone laid side by side to form a road wide 
enough for two wagons to rumble down. The occasional wagon led 
by either donkeys or mules do make their way up and down the 
path, which leads up at a noticable, yet not problematic, angle 
to the east. Off the road, the raw, black rock of the branching 
of the Ephel Duath that forms the perimeter of the eastern 
settlement named Tur Edendor, the stone walls and flags of the 
town visible from here.

A Forboding Trail Leading up to the Eastern Peaks~
   Though the broad pavers of the trail lead from east to west 
over this section of the Ephel Duath mountains, the path is far 
from straight, shifting north and south in broad curves to take a 
gentle climb towards the eastern peaks or western road, ledges of 
black and grey rock hanging over lower sections of the road below 
it. A few scrubby bushes grow along the trail in the few patches 
of dirt to be seen here, the occasional startled rabbit to seen 
scurrying away from the light foot traffic that walks past here.

Flattened Mountain Trail Leading Through a Valley~
   Travel north and south is impossible, thick mountain walls 
standing in the way as the cobbled mountain path leading between 
the ruins of Tur Edendor and the Harad Road enters a rocky valley 
here. The path occupies all the space between the two cliff 
faces, and loose patches of pebbles and shale cover it in some 
places, more often than not a vicious wind whipping over the 
sharp tops of the peaks that sends a few more stones bouncing 
down to join them. To the east, the road grows steeper, leading 
deeper in to the valley of mountain-peaks, while to the west it 
runs downwards in to more open land.

Narrow, Rocky Valley~
   In the western skyline a circular spire of jagged mountains 
forms the outer wall of the township of Tur Edendor, the bleak 
slopes of rock home to nothing. In some places on the steep 
incline to the peak, dirt and even grass have grown over the 
black rock of the mountains, but most of the climbs is nothing 
more than overlapping ledges of rock, and the occasional 
individual boulder or light scattering of pebbles. Progress any 
further to the north, south or west is halted by the sheer slope 
of the mountains.

ring that trails off from similar, dark, range to the east. 
West, the evergreen tops of a distant forest can be seen, and 
beyond it another great mass of mountains, this time their slopes 
a chalky white in colour.

A few struggling trees, mostly lone pines, even less boasting a

branches of the trees, no animals are to be seen here.

the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces

spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the west,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

to be seen here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make
their homes in the craggy lips and caves visible on the surface

tall, untamed vegetation, and the occasional large rock that

Anduin, the various outflows and streams caused by these two 
streams joining sending dozens of little trickles and currents of

ground to little more than a heath. No crops or buildings can be
seen here, instead tall grasses and stunted trees growing up from
the soil that is constantly wet and squishy underfoot.

swarm of small insects that swarm about a tree or bush. The 
ground underfoot is always soft and muddy, and quickly rises to
ankle-deep water whenever rain falls from overhead.

Turn to the North and East of the Trail~
   This thin, nameless trail runs from the shores of the mighty 
Anduin that flows through Gondor to the west, aimed east at a 
rise of mountains a short distance before the Ephel Duath. Two 
lines of heavy, off-white stones mark the borders of this path, 
set a good dozen paces across, the centre plain packed dirt. Off 
the north of the trail a woodlands quickly rises up, while to the 
south farmlands are visible.

Nameless Trail Leading East and West~
   This trail runs from east to west, and looks to be well 
tended; two lines boundary stones mark the edges, and the forest 
of firs and spruces to the north extend not a branch on to the 
road proper. Green grass grows abudantly about the edges of the 
trail, both north and south, in the latter direction extending 
some light farmlands and boggy ground.

Crossing of Roads~
   Harad Road, leading straight north and south, is cut across by 
a nameless trail from the west, the area about the two trails 
composed of stamped down dirt, any grass or vegetation native to 
the area long eradicated by the constant press of boots and 
wagons. To the east, a circle of black peaks is set before the 
mountain wall of the Ephel Duath, to the northwest a evergreen 
forest grows and beyond it the chalky cliffs of the Emyn Arnen, 
and to the west and south the land slopes downwards, two rivers 
visible during the day.

Narrow Stretch of Grassy Land Between Mountains and Road~
   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown,
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

Grassy Knoll Between Two Mountains~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

   Travel through these hills is far from easy; the landscape 
climbs and falls, yet uniformly grows more steep and stark as it 
heads east to the towering, shard-like black mountains that mark 
the lands of Mordor. No human habitation is visible this close 
to dark border, but across the west the occasional fortified 
village or isolated farmhouse can be seen.

Atop a Dry Hummock~
   A thick growth of low lying bushes roams across the hills of 
South Ithilien that lie between the low lying plains to the west

Small animal life darts amongst the clustered clumps of 
vegetation, as well as the occasional larger predator lurking far 
from the distant plateau to the northwest, or the forest westward.

Northwest of the Ridged Mountain Range~
   The hard grass that rolls in from the west quickly becomes 
even tougher rock under foot, a narrow plateau continuing before 
the unscaleable sides of the Ephel Duath tear up from the ground, 
ending so high in the sky that one must crane their neck back to 
view the splintered peaks in their malignant majesty. North and 
south the range continues without any apparent end.

the massive formation of volcanic rock blotting out the eastern

sloping downwards in that direction to finally end at a vast
woodlands and a river.

East of the River Anduin~
   West, the waters of the River Anduin run, far from the 
frenzied rush from which the currents surge to the north, but 
still fast enough to easily drag under all but the greatest of
swimmers. The shore here of loose dirt descends slowly under the
cold flow, the occasional coniferous tree sprouting out along the
riverbank or large rock rising out a short distance in the water.
The opposite bank of the river lies far to the west, barely 
visible against the course of the river.

Anduin, the various outflows and streams caused by these two 
streams joining sending dozens of little trickles and currents of
waters throughout this area of South Ithilien, reducing the 
ground to little more than a heath. No crops or buildings can be
seen here, instead tall grasses and stunted trees growing up from

   Small hillocks and short gullies rise and fall here in South
Ithilien, the overriding dampness of the land wearing away the 
areas of dirt and soil and leaving the occasional high peak of
flint or some other form of rock. The marshy ground lets nothing
grow upon it except low lying scrub bushes, and the occasional
colony of moss upon an ancient, felled shell of a dead tree. To
the south and west, the land grows moister as it approaches a

Between Two Branches of the Ephel Duath~
   Perhaps once the site of tilled fields and tended farms, these
plains of South Ithilien are now bleak and home to only tall
grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly from
the distant black mountains eastward to the western horizon are
the fractured remainders of buildings past; the odd, blackened
wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds and moss,
an old, dried up well.

Atop an Empty Mesa~
   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby 
and wiry bushes, and some stretches of pale grass that bows in 
the wind. More often than not, great gusts of air blow down from 
the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the mighty 
Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

Desolate Ithilien Uplands~
   The landscape here is damaged, bruised and beaten into hilly 
growths and small valley drops, covered in a coating of yellow 
grass. The occasional animal stalks through the area, though 
most common are circles of soaring birds high in the air, 
drifting on the winds that blow across South Ithilien. To the 
west, the vast, dry plains of Gondor's hither lands stretch.

At the Base of a Brooding Mountain Range~
   The stark range of the Ephel Duath roams from north to south
here, this land a bumpy, rocky spit of land situated before the
steep ascent of the mountains to the east and the softer,
greener hillands of South Ithilien to the west. The only life
to be seen here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make
their homes in the craggy lips and caves visible on the surface
of the dark mountains.

Before Wind-Blasted Peaks~
   Howling wind funnels down the notches and gaps in the
splintered peaks of the black mountains of Mordor that burst from
the ground to the east, a short run of increasingly rocky and
steep terrain rising up to them. Along with the wind comes the
smell of something old, a chill presence and the occasional fine
dust of soot.

Bank of the Anduin~
   Grainy, dirty sand marks the border between the River Anduin
and the broad plains of South Ithilien here, much of the western
horizon occupied by the massive stream that forms the west-most
boundary of these lands of Gondor. The area here is marked by the
tall, untamed vegetation, and the occasional large rock that 
rises above the knee high grasses. The winds that rise from the
waters are chill, and the gurgle of running water never stills.

Rivershore of the Anduin Twisting North and West~
   The farmlands of South Ithilien come to a gradual end as the
ground slips beneath the brisk waters of the River Anduin west,
the lands about the riverbank clear of any cultivation and home 
to nothing more than a flourishing of shoreside trees and tall 
grasses. Just as the terrain slopes down from east to west, so
does it fall gradually from the distant white plateau of Emyn
Arnen north to a ford of rivers southward.

   Small hillocks and short gullies rise and fall here in South
Ithilien, the overriding dampness of the land wearing away the 
areas of dirt and soil and leaving the occasional high peak of
flint or some other form of rock. The marshy ground lets nothing
grow upon it except low lying scrub bushes, and the occasional
colony of moss upon an ancient, felled shell of a dead tree. To
the south and west, the land grows moister as it approaches a 
pair of large rivers.

Ithilien is visible here, the rushes and reeds and felled trees

swarm of small insects that swarm about a tree or bush. The 
ground underfoot is always soft and muddy, and quickly rises to
ankle-deep water whenever rain falls from overhead.

   This thin, nameless trail runs north to south, between shores 
of the mighty Anduin that flows through Gondor to the west, and
east of a rise of mountains a short distance before the Ephel 
Duath. Two lines of heavy, off-white stones mark the borders of 
this path, set a good dozen paces across, the centre plain packed
dirt. Off the north of the trail a woodlands quickly rises up, 
while to the south farmlands are visible.

though on occasion distant shadows can be seen far away in the

the Ithilien spill off the road, leading westward in to a sparse
plain of farmland and bog, while east the bleak shards of the

major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the north,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

branches of the trees, no animals are to be seen here.

Rock-Dotted Ithilien Field~
   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown,
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

sloping downwards in that direction to finally end at a vast
woodlands and a river.

Soft Shore of the Great River~
   West, the waters of the River Anduin run, far from the 
frenzied rush from which the currents surge to the north, but 
still fast enough to easily drag under all but the greatest of
swimmers. The shore here of loose dirt descends slowly under the
cold flow, the occasional coniferous tree sprouting out along the
riverbank or large rock rising out a short distance in the water.
The opposite bank of the river lies far to the west, barely 
visible against the course of the river.

the soil that is constantly wet and squishy underfoot.

Slushy Ithilien~
   Small hillocks and short gullies rise and fall here in South
Ithilien, the overriding dampness of the land wearing away the 
areas of dirt and soil and leaving the occasional high peak of
flint or some other form of rock. The marshy ground lets nothing
grow upon it except low lying scrub bushes, and the occasional
colony of moss upon an ancient, felled shell of a dead tree. To
the south and west, the land grows moister as it approaches a 
pair of large rivers.

Dam-Occupied Farmland~
   While the eastern horizon is dominated by the bleak peaks
of the Ephel Duath that rise above the thin woodlands and barren
plains of South Ithilien, here, vibrant crops grow year round,
tended by the peasantry of Gondor that works the fields under the
watchful shadow of the south-eastward fort. Spread between the
fields and pastures is the occasional green-watered dam.

Wet, Farmed, Fields~
   Tended fields grow bountiful crops in this section of South 
Ithilien, farmers seen tending to their flocks and produce, 
housed in the numerous daub and wattle cottages that populate the 
green, fallow hills. Numerous paths and wagon tracks cut across 
the cultivated lands, leading between the various farmsteads and 
towards the fortification located on a hill to the south.

A Bend in Harad Road, Leading North and East~
   The dusty path of the Harad road continues north and east 
here through South Ithilien, little more than a narrow depression 
of land, as if once an ancient river ran along this course. To 
the east of the road, bleak plains and distant mountains rise up, 
while the western edge is bordered by scrubby farmland tilled 
above the shore of the Anduin River.

despite the distance at which it runs. East, a small stretch of 
brown grasslands linger before the mighty Ephel Duath, a myriad 
of smaller paths branching off the Harad to lead to abandoned 
farmhouses set on distant hillocks. North and south the road 
progresses, far beyond what the eye can hope to see.

Desolate Plains Near a Road~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

Bare Terrain South of a Rocky Mesa~
   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown,
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

   Perhaps once the site of tilled fields and tended farms, these
plains of South Ithilien are now bleak and home to only tall
grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly from
the distant black mountains eastward to the western horizon are
the fractured remainders of buildings past; the odd, blackened
wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds and moss,
an old, dried up well.

sloped plain, the flat fields offering one a fine view of the
major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the north,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

Scrub-Dotted Hills~
   A thick growth of low lying bushes roams across the hills of 
South Ithilien that lie between the low lying plains to the west 
and the steep, thrusting, presence of the eastward mountains. 
Small animal life darts amongst the clustered clumps of 
vegetation, as well as the occasional larger predator lurking far 
from the distant plateau to the northwest, or the forest westward.

   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby 
and wiry bushes, and some stretches of pale grass that bows in 
the wind. More often than not, great gusts of air blow down from 
the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the mighty 
Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

Rocky Land Before The Ephel Duath~
   Howling wind funnels down the notches and gaps in the
splintered peaks of the black mountains of Mordor that burst from
the ground to the east, a short run of increasingly rocky and
steep terrain rising up to them. Along with the wind comes the
smell of something old, a chill presence and the occasional fine
dust of soot.

the unscaleable sides of the Ephel Duath tear up from the ground, 
ending so high in the sky that one must crane their neck back to 
view the splintered peaks in their malignant majesty. North and 
south the range continues without any apparent end.

ground slips beneath the brisk waters of the River Anduin west,
the lands about the riverbank clear of any cultivation and home 
to nothing more than a flourishing of shoreside trees and tall 
grasses. Just as the terrain slopes down from east to west, so
does it fall gradually from the distant white plateau of Emyn
Arnen north to a ford of rivers southward.

the ominous presence of the black, shard like mountains of the

small dirt trail leads around the boulders to the encampment on

Abandoned Ithilien Land~
   Perhaps once the site of tilled fields and tended farms, these
plains of South Ithilien are now bleak and home to only tall
grasses and the occasional small grove of sickly, stunted 
evergreens. Here and there across the slope that runs slowly from
the distant black mountains eastward to the western horizon are
the fractured remainders of buildings past; the odd, blackened
wooden shell of a barn, a stone base colonized by weeds and moss,
an old, dried up well.

Desolate Terrain~
   From east to west the South Ithilien rolls down in a gently
sloped plain, the flat fields offering one a fine view of the
major landmarks of the area; the imposing mountain range that is
the eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces
clustered about the Emyn Arnen plateau to the north west, a hard
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the north,
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller
stream to the south-west.

Somber Farmland~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping
winds of South Ithilien quickly blowing away this light covering
of soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of Southern Gondor.

Rolling, Grass-Covered Hills~
   The landscape here is damaged, bruised and beaten into hilly 
growths and small valley drops, covered in a coating of yellow 
grass. The occasional animal stalks through the area, though 
most common are circles of soaring birds high in the air, 
drifting on the winds that blow across South Ithilien. To the 
west, the vast, dry plains of Gondor's hither lands stretch.

Barren Foothills~
   The ground here is far from flat, rising in waves of hills and 
falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that 
spurts forth from the ground and is accompanied by a clustering 
of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
fields of South Ithilien westward, to the mighty, stark mountain 
face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

Rocky Foothills Before The Ephel Duath~
   The stark range of the Ephel Duath roams from north to south 
here, this land a bumpy, rocky spit of land situated before the 
steep ascent of the mountains to the east and the softer, greener 
hillands of South Ithilien to the west. The only life to be seen 
here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make their homes 
in the craggy lips and caves visible on the surface of the dark 
mountains. 
   A deep rock pool is visible in a dark recess of the cliff face 
east of here.

Twisting Rivershore Stretching East and South~
   The farmlands of South Ithilien come to a gradual end as the
ground slips beneath the brisk waters of the River Anduin west,
the lands about the riverbank clear of any cultivation and home 
to nothing more than a flourishing of shoreside trees and tall 
grasses. Just as the terrain slopes down from east to west, so
does it fall gradually from the distant white plateau of Emyn
Arnen north to a ford of rivers southward.

and the broad plains of South Ithilien here, much of the western
horizon occupied by the massive stream that forms the west-most
boundary of these lands of Gondor. The area here is marked by the
tall, untamed vegetation, and the occasional large rock that 
rises above the knee high grasses. The winds that rise from the
waters are chill, and the gurgle of running water never stills.

ranges, the former by the white cliffs of the Emyn Arnen, the

Anduin, the various outflows and streams caused by these two 
streams joining sending dozens of little trickles and currents of

Ithilien, the overriding dampness of the land wearing away the 
areas of dirt and soil and leaving the occasional high peak of
flint or some other form of rock. The marshy ground lets nothing
grow upon it except low lying scrub bushes, and the occasional
colony of moss upon an ancient, felled shell of a dead tree. To

Ithilien is visible here, the rushes and reeds and felled trees
and grasses are alive with all manner of small rodents, birds,

swarm of small insects that swarm about a tree or bush. The 
ground underfoot is always soft and muddy, and quickly rises to
ankle-deep water whenever rain falls from overhead.

of peasant cottages or orchids of fruit bearing trees. The

tended by the peasantry of Gondor that works the fields under the

   From the north the Anduin flows, to meet with the Poros that 
leads down from the Ephel Duath visible in the distant east. The 
merging of rivers creates a dozen other tiny rivulets and streams 
that come and go with the sluggish tides, and shiftings of the

east, to an unsteady bog. The mud underfoot is soft, and 
movement through the countryside here is accompanied by much

A few stunted trees grow along the riverbank, some with long,

North Shore of the River Poros~
   From east to west the broad Poros River flows to the south here,
marking the border between the lands of South Ithilien and South
Gondor. The current looks swift, and the waters cold, the 
occasional large rock jutting out of the blue ribbon in an island
of foam. Before the river, upon the bank, the soil is soft and
muddy, and thick grass untamed by man grows here, alive with many
small river animals and birds.

Muddy Riverbank~
   South of here a broad river runs, the opposite shore looking 
to be at least a hundred yards away, and how deep the cold blue 
waters sink is beyond estimation. From east to west the swift 
river current flows, though far from a straight progression, many 
loops and kinks in the banks visible. The land north of the bank 
looks bleak and untiled, and so does the land south, this area of 
Gondor near abandoned.

   Flowing from the ever-present Ephel Duath that crowd the

the Poros here flows clear and pure, the odd small creature

A few stunted trees grow along the riverbank, some with long, 
drooping branches that dip in to the blue waters, others occupied 
by nests of chirping birds.

South-West of a Hilltop Village, in the Fields~
   The normal rolling landscape of South Ithilien smooths to a 
flat, fertile stretch of land, occupied by hardworking farmers 
that have made numerous cottages to live in as they tend the rows
of crops that grow in plentifully here. During the night, the 
only lights are those that twinkle in the distant fort that sits 
above the fief, to the north-east.

Farms Erected Upon A Twisting River Shore~
   While the eastern horizon is dominated by the bleak peaks of 
the Ephel Duath that rise above the thin woodlands and barren 
plains of South Ithilien, here, vibrant crops grow year round, 
tended by the peasantry of Gondor that works the fields under the 
watchful shadow of the northward fort. Spread between the fields 
and pastures is the occasional green-watered dam. The River 
Poros twists from the east to south here, bordering the farms and 
villages.

Fields by a River Bank~
   Tended fields grow bountiful crops in this section of South 
Ithilien, farmers seen tending to their flocks and produce,

the cultivated lands, leading between the various farmsteads and

Swampy Land North of the Poros~
   This depression of land in South Ithilien pools frequently 
with water, a number of tiny streams and rivulets filling with
muddy liquid with the movement of the tides, spilling forth to
drench the surrounding countryside. Past the boggy land, the
distant northern and eastern horizon are claimed by mountains
ranges, the former by the white cliffs of the Emyn Arnen, the
latter the black shards of the Ephel Duath. South and west, the
terrain continues to descend to a junction of rivers.

Harad Road North of a Bridge~
   The unglamorous dirt trail that is Harad Road winds its way 
north and south through South Ithilien, leading past the borders 
of a boggy farmland westward, and hilly land becomes the black 
mountains of Mordor to the east. The occasional patch of grass 
grows across the road, at times the trail becomes 
indistinguishable from the scrubby plains that it cuts through.

Overgrown Ithilien Landscape~
   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown,
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard underfoot,
and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, great 
boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. The area
is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the black, shard
like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour atmosphere over
the landscape.

most common are circles of soaring birds high in the air, 
drifting on the winds that blow across South Ithilien. To the 
west, the vast, dry plains of Gondor's hither lands stretch. A 
river-gulley flows east to west south of the hills.

of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
fields of South Ithilien westward, to the mighty, stark mountain 
face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

   The hard grass that rolls in from the west quickly becomes 
even tougher rock under foot, a narrow plateau continuing before 
the unscaleable sides of the Ephel Duath tear up from the ground, 
ending so high in the sky that one must crane their neck back to 
view the splintered peaks in their malignant majesty. North and 
south the range continues without any apparent end.

On A Small Plateau Before The Ephel Duath~
   Howling wind funnels down the notches and gaps in the 
splintered peaks of the black mountains of Mordor that burst from 
the ground to the east, a short run of increasingly rocky and 
steep terrain rising up to them. Along with the wind comes the 
smell of something old, a chill presence and the occasional fine 
dust of soot. A narrow, jagged crevice slashes down the rock 
face.

out of stone and wood and leading south to the shore some fifty 
yards away. A dirt path, the Harad Road, leads from the north to 
before the bridge, neat yet old flagstones set immediately before 
the structure, weeds and grass growing between them. To the 
distant north, a section of the black mountain wall of the Ephel 
Duath that is the eastern horizon breaks off to form a circular 
spire of rocks, while to the south the bleak plains of South 
Gondor stretch.

Desolate Foothills~
   Travel through these hills is far from easy; the landscape

heads east to the towering, shard-like black mountains that mark 
the lands of Mordor. No human habitation is visible this close 
to dark border, but across the west the occasional fortified 
village or isolated farmhouse can be seen. To the south, the 
waters of a cold river flow.

Rocky Ledge Above a River~
   The stark range of the Ephel Duath roams from north to south 
here, this land a bumpy, rocky spit of land situated before the 
steep ascent of the mountains to the east and the softer, greener 
hillands of South Ithilien to the west. The only life to be seen 
here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make their homes 
in the craggy lips and caves visible on the surface of the dark 
mountains. From high above, a river tumbles down the jagged 
rocks on the mountain, the blue waters gathering in a large pool 
of stone before flowing westward across the Ithilien.

Atop a Hill Overlooking a Bend in the Anduin~
   This gently-sloping, partially wooded hillock rises above the 
low, western countryside of South Ithilien. To the north and 
west the rich earth of the hill turns to rock which plunges into 
the wide blue of the river Anduin below, the escarpment worn by 
erosion. The rest of the land here is blanketed in grasses and 
other vegetation, the ground knotted by the roots of scattered 
trees. In all directions the woodland stretches onward, the 
height of the terrain here offering a stunning view of the hills 
of the Emyn Arnen rising in the distant east.

Cramped Little Rocky Alcove~
   This is not so much a cave as it is a small alcove in the 
rocky face of one of the hills of the Emyn Arnen. Rough walls of 
rock rise up on either side of the entrance, which faces north, 
and almost come together at the top, providing some shelter from 
the elements, as well as allowing daylight in. The ground is wet 
or dry depending on the weather, although one portion of the dirt 
floor is quite well sheltered from whatever rain that may fall. 
It is not quite high enough for a man to stand fully upright, 
though it is deep enough that one could rest here. Several 
shrubs grow around the entrance, partially concealing it.

Climbing the Barricades~
   Progression up and down the felled-tree barricade is possible 
through grappling and pulling one's self up, making use of the 
thick hemp ropes that bind the logs together to try and reach the 
top. However, a single slip can cast one back down to the ground 
below the barriacdes.

Underneath the Gatehouse~
   This narrow passage is perhaps broad enough for three men to 
walk through abreast, as it leads through the stout gates and a 
rope-lashed portcullis that permits entry in to the small walled 
village, or access outside to the South Ithilien. Overhead is a 
creaking wooden walkway, shot throughout it numerous small arrow 
holes and tunnels, allowing anyone stationed above to rain ruin 
and death down in to the gatehouse.

Town Square of the Tiny Village~
   The crooked path that cuts from south to east through this 
tiny village enlargens here to a dusty town square, filled with 
stray dogs, scattered livestock, off-duty mercenaries and a few 
chattering commoners dressed in drab, homespun clothing. The 
buildings in this section of the village are slightly larger than 
those found elsewhere, a run-down building fashioned from stone 
and painted wood set to the west, clearly once the house of the 
lord of the fiefdom.

Dirt Path Through the Walled Village~
   This dirt path leads through the small stone and wooden houses 
that have been constructed along it, or those that still remain 
standing and mostly whole. Several of the buildings seem 
uninhabited, though a number of brightly painted market stalls 
are arranged directly north of the road, against the wall, and 
offer basic services such as smithying and tinkering to the 
populace. To the east, a rope-lashed portcullis lies, while to 
the northeast a ladder is lain against the battlements.

Southern Gatehouse of the Walled Village~
   The battlements above the walled village below have been 
constructed carefully, fashioned from stout tree trunks shaped 
and fire hardened, and carefully proofed against any attack from 
fire. A sweeping view of South Ithilien is visible from high up 
here, the immediate farmlands about the walled village, the Emyn 
Arnen north, the Ephel Duath East, and the River Anduin west. A 
boardwalk leads about the rest of the battlements. 
   Here, the wooden structure continues over one's head, a rough 
wooden gatehouse built to grant extra protection to the section 
of the battlements situated over the village gate. A series of 
thick wooden shutters in the ground open down to a murderhole.

North-Western Battlements of the Walled Village~
   The battlements above the walled village below have been 
constructed carefully, fashioned from stout tree trunks shaped 
and fire hardened, and carefully proofed against any attack from 
fire. A sweeping view of South Ithilien is visible from high up 
here, the immediate farmlands about the walled village, the Emyn 
Arnen north, the Ephel Duath East, and the River Anduin west. A 
boardwalk leads about the rest of the battlements.

Battlement Boardwalk Above the Village~
   The centre of this area is a gaping hole of air, leading down 
to the middle of the tiny village below. Instead, bordering it 
to the north, east, south and west are the boardwalks of the 
battlements around the walls of the village, this section 
allowing one to make their way quickly from one side of the fort 
to another.

Shale-Covered Trail Winding Through a Mountain Valley~
   Loose rocks and shale cover this hazardous path as it winds 
from west to east through the steep peaks of the Ephel Duath, 
barely wide enough for two men to walk down it side by side. On 
the northern side, the impossibly steep peaks of the mountains 
abates somewhat, becoming merely dangerously steep, but perhaps 
allowing one to scale it if desperate enough. The western end of 
the valley is blocked by a series of thick boulders that looks to 
have fallen from the top of a black spire of rock at the top of 
the northern incline.

Choking Trail Twisting from West to North~
   This narrow fissure that spreads between two immutable walls 
of stone is shunted north, narrowing to a tiny gap as it moves 
further northward, and even to the west it is still tight enough 
to force any party in to a single file. Howling winds buffet 
down, whistling through the jagged peaks of the Ephel Duath, 
flooding this choking trail with air that chills the bones.

Tiny Valley Path Through the Ephel Duath~
   A tiny road that is nothing but a relatively flat path between 
two rapidly rising walls of stone cuts a path from a narrow gap 
south to broader flat stretch of rock to the east. Littering the 
path are a number of ragged remains of habitation; long, thin 
pieces of metal rusted in to obscurity, human bones wrapped in 
tattered linens, and scraps of rotted leather.

End Of a Crooked Mountain Trail at the Base of the Worn Rock Stairs~
   Bordered by the rapidly climbing black rock slopes of the 
Ephel Duath on all sides, this circular rock platform is far from 
flat itself, lifting and falling in sudden rises and holes. On 
the northern side of the rock clearing, a rough staircase of 
stone looks to have been once cut in to the side of the mountain, 
but countless years of erosion by wind and rain has reduce it to 
a set of jagged handholds, the climb upwards a steep and 
unforgiving one. A breach in the wall of rocks lies to the west, 
in the form of a narrow trail leading on to a tiny valley.

Climbing the Weather-Scarred Rock Stairs~
   Perhaps once carved in to a stout set of stairs, the years of 
exposure have token their tolls, leaving the carvings in to the 
black rock as little more that stumps to grip with one's hands to 
pull themselves up. At the top of the climb, an arch has been 
hacked in to the side of the mountain, the base of the black 
spire of the Ephel Duath that arcs out to the west.

Shattered Sentryroom of the Stone Guardtower~
   This precise, squarish room has been hacked directly out of 
the black rock that forms the Ephel Duath, and yet great care and 
precision has obviously gone in to the effort. The rock walls 
are nearly perfectly flat, and framed as a near-perfect square in 
dimension, and to the east a graceful arch leads out to a steep 
mountain slope. A series of arrow slits glance down to a narrow 
valley trail, and a steep set of stairs runs up the western wall 
to the next level of the tower.

Circular Stone Watch Chamber Hacked From the Mountain Side~
   Curved in to a perfect circle, this watch chamber looks out 
upon to a narrow valley trail leading through the black mountains 
to the south, and out another series of arrow slits to South 
Ithilien that lies to the west. Cold air often streams in 
through the narrow windows leading in to the chamber, 
occasionally disturbing the scraps of metal, leather, bone and 
wood that litter the floor. A staircase leads downwards at the 
eastern side of the room, and a narrow corridor leads west.

   Large rocks and patches of loose pebbles obstruct the circular

narrow corridor set eastward. Dark stains are splattered against 
the perfectly carved stone walls, and on the southern side next 
to the arrow slits the rock is chipped and damaged.

Open-Air Towertop of the Shard-like Spire off the Ephel Duath~
   Sharp shards of rock rise up all about this flat-carved 
towertop, giving it an imposing, imperial image as it branches 
off out westward of the Ephel Duath and instead offers an 
expansive view of the South Ithilien that stretches out to the 
west. From the Emyn Arnen to the distant peaks of the White 
Mountains, near all of Gondor's southern terrain is visible from 
this vantage point. In the centre of the towertop is a broad 
stone staircase leading down in to the spire, a trio of large 
builders surrounding it. On the southern edge, a line of 
boulders is set a dozen paces back, numerous holes in the rough 
rock fence.

Climbing Along the side of the Shard-like Spire~
   A thick spire of black rock branches off from a larger peak of 
the Ephel Duath, and the air here howls past the pitted and 
jagged wall of the spire. Although the black slope is imposing, 
scaling up and down it, past the occasional arrow slit carved in 
to the stone, is possible, though coursing up and down as the 
harsh winds funneled down through the surrounding mountains rages 
is far from safe.

to the south, that edge a jagged tear of stone. The occasional

area is devoid of any other features. Below, a view of a tiny 
trail winding its way between the walls of the Ephel Duath can be

Western Battlements of the Walled Village~
   The battlements above the walled village below have been 
constructed carefully, fashioned from stout tree trunks shaped 
and fire hardened, and carefully proofed against any attack from 
fire. A sweeping view of South Ithilien is visible from high up 
here, the immediate farmlands about the walled village, the Emyn

Battlement Boardwalk Above the Village~
   The centre of this area is a gaping hole of air, leading down 
to the middle of the tiny village below. Instead, bordering it 
to the north, east, south and west are the boardwalks of the 
battlements around the walls of the village, this section 
allowing one to make their way quickly from one side of the fort 
to another.

Town Square of the Tiny Village~
   The crooked path that cuts from south to north through this 
tiny village enlargens here to a dusty town square, filled with 
laughing children and chattering commoners dressed in drab, 
homespun clothing, yet nonetheless look healthy and well fed. 
The buildings in this section of the village are slightly larger 
than those found elsewhere, a prominent building fashioned from 
stone and painted wood set to the west, clearly the house of the 
lord of the fiefdom.

Dirt Path Through the Walled Village~
   This dirt path leads through the small stone and wooden houses 
that have been constructed along it, that house the wealthier 
denizens of the village, or, at least, wealthy compared to the 
poor farmers that labour in the fields outside. A number of 
brightly painted market stalls are arranged at the odd point 
along the road, offering basic services such as smithying and 
tinkering to the populace. To the north, a rope-lashed 
portcullis lies, while to the east a ladder is lain against the 
battlements.

   This narrow passage is perhaps broad enough for three men to 
walk through abreast, as it leads through the stout gates and a 
rope-lashed portcullis that permits entry in to the small walled 
village, or access outside to the South Ithilien. Overhead is a 
creaking wooden walkway, shot throughout it numerous small arrow 
holes and tunnels, allowing anyone stationed above to rain ruin 
and death down in to the gatehouse.

Ramshackle Village Path~
   A ramshackle path cuts from the southern portcullis to deeper 
north inside the tiny village, littered with livestock of all 
sorts and more than the odd wagon as farmers take their wares to 
and from the markets, or to give as tribute to their local lord. 
Underfoot, the path is nothing more than packed dirt, but is kept 
sturdy by the constant stream of villagers that make their way 
along this road and through the gate, or in to their simple 
houses that line in. A thick ladder set against the western 
battlements allows one access up to them.

of the battlements situated over the fort gate. A series of 
thick wooden shutters in the ground open down to a murderhole.

Atop the Tall Stone Tower in the Fort, Overlooking the Ithilien~
   A commanding view of the Ithilien is gained from his squat 
tower, during the day allowing one to see all the way from the 
dark, looming mountain range to the east, to the massive 
sprawling Anduin river to the west. A knee-height parapet runs 
about the tower, forcing one to move with a degree of caution 
about the edge lest trip and fall down into the marshal yard 
below. A heavy brazier rests in the centre of the towertop.

Inside the Damaged Stone Tower~
   What little room there is in this damaged stone tower is 
occupied by crude pallets and bunks, and on occasion the soldiers 
of the fort resting when not on duty. The walls have been 
fashioned with careful worksmanship now damaged of stone blocks, 
blackened and tarred to grant protection against fire. A stout 
doorway rests in the western side of the tower, opening inwards 
out into the marshal yard of the fort, and a thick ladder ends at 
a trapdoor, leading out onto the top of the tower.

Dirt Marshal Yard Within the Small Wooden Fort~
   Dark dirt is underfoot in this small marshal yard within the 
squat fort, the area enclosed by wall of sharpened, blackened and 
tarred logs that from a rough circle about the central tower. A 
eastern door leads into the rough construction, fashioned of wood 
treated the same as the outer wall. The yard is kept clean, and 
soldiers bustle about with it, engaged in drills or moving 
supplies back and forth from the gate. A ramp of earth leads 
south up onto the battlements. 
   The gates of the fort are set in the northern wall of the 
fort.

Southern Battlements of the Walled Village~
   The battlements above the walled village below have been 
constructed carefully, fashioned from stout tree trunks shaped 
and fire hardened, and carefully proofed against any attack from 
fire. A littered boardwalk leads about the rest of the 
battlements. Crudely spaced double rows of tall wooden posts 
support a roof of animal hides, torn canvas and branches. Human 
remains, along with rotting animal skulls and bones hang randomly 
out of this precarious, gruesome pavilion, lending some shelter 
from sunlight.

Northern Gatehouse of the Walled Village~
   The dark blood-stained battlements above the walled village 
have been sturdily fashioned from stout tree trunks shaped and 
fire hardened. A sweeping view of South Ithilien is visible from 
high up here, the ruined farmlands about the walled village, the 
Emyn Arnen north, the Ephel Duath East, and the River Anduin 
west. A littered boardwalk leads about the rest of the 
battlements. 
   Here, the wooden structure continues over one's head, a rough 
wooden gatehouse built to grant extra protection to the section 
of the battlements situated over the village gate. A shattered 
wooden shutter on the floor reveals an opening to a murderhole. 
Nailed to the roof are several mutilated human heads, attached 
with black cord to rusty nails.

allowing one to make their way quickly from one side of the fort

Dirt Path Through the Walled Village~
   The dirt path leads through burnt out remains of simple 
dwellings lining the side of the road, now taken over by the 
clutter and filth of blackblood tents and firepits. Assaulting 
the senses before the gate is a huge mound of disarticulated 
remains of yrcs, humans and animals heaped high. The charnel 
pile is constantly writhing with insects and rodents and blocks 
any movement to the northern gate, or to the rope-lashed 
portcullis.

Town Square of the Tiny Village~
   The crooked path that cuts from north to west through this 
tiny village enlargens here to a ruined town square, bustling 
with yrcish troops and the occasional goblin rider passing by on 
a snarling warg. The buildings in this section of the village 
are smashed and burnt, their remaining walls covered in bloodied 
drawings of skulls, any intact roofs adorned with skulls and the 
remains of the villagers who once lived here. To the east, in 
the ruins of what looks to have been once a splendid manor, a 
large, circular wooden door has been set in the ground, opening 
outwards and leading down in to an orc cave.

Ramshackle Village Path~
   A ramshackle path cuts from the western portcullis to deeper 
east inside the tiny village. It is littered with excrement, 
shattered bones, crushed skulls. Underfoot, the path is nothing 
more than packed dirt, but is kept sturdy by the constant stream 
of guards and troops that make their way along this road and 
through the gate. Burnt out remains of simple dwellings line the 
side of the road, now taken over by the clutter and filth of 
blackblood tents and firepits. A thick ladder with bone rungs is 
set against the southern battlements.

Within a Towering Wood Gatehouse Looking South Over the Town~
   Within this vast gatehouse constructed of thick, dark wooden 
beams there is constant movement and watch over the farmlands 
south of this somewhat hurried, yet awkwardly quiet population. 
A few pieces of wooden furniture has been set against the walls 
and a small, rounded table of rough wood sits central to the 
room, its surface scattered with various papers, pieces of 
leather and ink splotches. A wide archway has been constructed 
in the northern wall giving passage to the platform leading north 
to the central tower of this fort. A number of crude flags hang 
tattered, their matter aroused on occasion by the cold winds 
which float around the top of the battlements.

Wooden Battlements Join Westward Here With a Tall Gatehouse~
   This long wooden platform of dark wooden beams which serve as 
battlements continue southwards here in a steady circumference of 
the wooden, spired tower central to the bustling town below 
though a somewhat awkward silence falls over its population. 
Over the crenellated eastern wall can be spied the lands far past 
the town: farmlands, houses and stables where members of the town 
work the fertile lands of South Ithilien. A smaller wooden wall 
along the west side of this battlement prevents movement over the 
edge of the battlements and onto the town some distance below 
though further along the wall and to the west is a large, thick 
wooden door adjoining the battlements with a towering wood 
gatehouse, its tattered flags blowing gently in the wind.

Wooden Battlements Facing East Over a Bustling Town~
   The sturdy battlements composed of thick, dark wooden beams 
here joins westwards to a tall wooden tower, connected simply by 
a long platform. A high, curving arch is set in the side of the 
tall tower and a myriad of flags have been cast up above its 
spired top. Over the crenellated beams of wood to the east can 
be seen vast farmlands of fertile, South Ithilien soil. Close 
than that and within the walls of the town move its population in 
a hurried manner though an awkward silence falls about the place.

Wooden Battlements Looking East over South Ithilien~
   These wooden battlements have been formulated from thick 
wooden beams bound with masonry and taught rope binding. 
Reaching just taller than the height of an average man, the 
eastern walls are neatly crenellated for observation of the lands 
far to the east where farms and houses have begun to develop and, 
of course, the awkwardly silent population of the town below. 
Notched, torn flags fly high over this fort of wooden structure 
in the gentle winds.

Inside a Tall Wooden Gatehouse Facing North Over Fertile Lands of South Ithilien~
   This tall wooden gatehouse is filled with the constant 
movement of people and sentries looking north over the lands that 
this bustling, yet eerily quiet town dominates. A few small 
windows have been cut out of the northern wood wall and a few 
pieces of furniture have been placed around the room for rest. 
Below, through a ladder-affixed trapdoor, can be seen the bottom 
gatehouse filled with dull-clad individuals passing into and out 
of this town, presumably farmers from the surrounding lands and a 
few small buildings can be seen within the walls. Two thick 
wooden doors are set into the walls east and west of here for 
access to the battlements.

Wooden Battlements Overlooking a Town, West of a Gatehouse~
   Thick beams of dark, smoothed wood have been strongly bound 
together with masonry and taught ropes to form the western wall 
of these wooden battlements which tower high above the town 
below. The tops of the wooden beams have been neatly cut 
straight and at regular intervals along the wall are small 
crenellations. Looking out over the battlements to the east can 
be seen a somewhat bustling town where people go about their 
daily duties and west are the green, fertile lands of South 
Ithilien where farmers and peasants might be seen toiling away at 
the soil. Though a similar wall crafted of wooden beams runs 
along the eastern side of this platform, a thick wooden door with 
a strange engraving lies to the east, set into a towering wooden 
gatehouse, its notched, torn flags wavering gently in the wind.

Wooden Battlements Facing West Over A Bustling Town~
   The sturdy battlements here connect eastward to a tall, round 
wooden tower by a sturdy wood platform. The platform runs into a 
curving wooden archway above the entrance to the tower which, at 
regular intervals about it structure, has carved into it long, 
thin slits, presumably for archers. Thick, dark beams of wood 
bound by masonry and taught rope compose the crenellated western 
wall and over its edge to the west can be seen the fertile lands 
of surrounding farms and houses; to the east and below is the 
small village which seems enveloped in an awkward silence.

Wooden Battlements Join Eastwards Here With a Gatehouse~
   The thick wooden battlements here overlook a town below 
bustling with variously clad individuals though mainly farmers 
clothed in dulled, torn clothing. Further west over the town's 
vast wooden walls lie the fertile lands of South Ithilien where 
farms and smaller housing has developed. The gates and 
portcullis of the town can be heard constantly opening and 
closing and muffled shouts and orders can be heard through a 
thick door set into the tall wooden gatehouse to the east. Small 
caravans of horse-drawn carts can be seen every now and then 
brought through the town's gates and an uncomforting silence 
looms over this populated place.

Path Through the Dismal Town~
   Thick cobbles of dark stone compose the majority of this north 
and south moving road. A myriad of individuals usually crowds 
its surface as they go about their daily duties and, whilst a 
busied place, it is usually dominated by an awkward silence of 
the folk which live here. A couple of buildings have been set 
off the edge of the road, their inside home to a number of people 
who can be seen passing in and out of the doors. To the north, a 
vast wooden gatehouse adorned with a colourful set of tattered 
flags dominates the surroundings and to the south looms a spired 
stone cathedral which is easily the tallest structure within the 
four walls of this town.

Upon a Cobbled Path Passing North to South Through the Town~
   Composed of broad, thick cobble stones, this road is busied 
with the farmer, worker and soldier population of this bustling, 
yet awkwardly quiet town. Caravans can sometimes be seen passing 
through the town's wooden gates and portcullis and along this 
road, dealing their various trades in the town markets. Carts 
drawn presumably by farmers can also be seen frequently along 
this path as they go about their daily business in this towering 
wood-walled town. Just to the north towers a spired stone 
cathedral, a myriad of notched, tattered flags flying crudely in 
the cold winds above. A few small stone establishments adjoin 
the road here, their threshold constantly passed over by various 
members of the town and to the south can be seen one of the two 
vast gatehouses overlooking this road.

Along a Worn, Cobbled Path Directly Below a Stone Cathedral~
   Looming over the centre of this busied town is a spired stone 
cathedral which connects via wooden platforms to the battlements. 
Though movement seems hurried and enthusiastic, there is an 
awkward atmosphere which constantly drifts over this town. A 
constant muttering can be heard amongst various dark-clad people 
and the peasant farmers which tend to the surrounding lands and 
every now and then a long caravan might be seen traveling this 
broad road. A few establishments fashioned from thick dark stone 
sit off the edge of the road here, their threshold's constant to 
migration of customers, especially the cathedral, situated east 
of the path, accessible through an arched wooden door. The odd 
strangely adorned individuals might be seen passing through the 
door, their heavily cloaked forms moving quietly through the 
various streets of the town though the majority of people that 
crowd the centre are farmers and workers of the lands.

Eroded Hillside Overlooking Wild Grasslands~
   Here, the ancient forces of wind and rain have caused the 
collapse of one side of a grassy hill. The wild, tough grasses 
of the area have yet to tame the resultant gash of earth that 
shows like a wound in an otherwise grassy sea. However, they 
have conquered the rest of the softly undulating ground here, and 
the vegetation resists the legs of the passing traveler just as 
the hills tax them.

Hillock West of Harad Road~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks.

small ditch compared to the land immediately to either side of 
the road. Grasslands mainly comprise the land around the road 
here, covering the hills in a sea of ripples caused by the wind.

Gusty Foothills Approaching A Wall Of Mountains~
   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby 
and wiry bushes, and some stretches of pale grass that bows in 
the wind. More often than not, great gusts of air blow down from 
the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the mighty 
Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

The Narthex of a Dark Marble Cathedral~
   Entering the narthex, or entry room, of this vast Cathedral of 
a dark grey marble, relatively little of the building can be 
seen. On the walls are various motifs and murals of intricate 
and colourful design, depicting epic-looking scenes, battles, and 
even some strange symbols and patterns. The ground itself is a 
highly polished grey marble that is light enough to appear white 
in most lights. There is a small granite font off to the side of 
the narthex, plain an unadorned, with two shallow steps leading 
up to it. At the northern end of the room there is a purple 
curtain that covers a door, which can be seen when the occasional 
feather-gust teases the edges of the hanging fabric. The narthex 
funnels pedestrians to the right as they enter, and then left 
again after a short while, leading into the nave.

A Vast, Acutely Roofed Nave~
   From this vast room, much of the innards of the Cathedral can 
be seen. The nave leads away from the narthex to the west, 
traveling around a hundred feet to the main altar. The roof, 
several storeys above the heads of those on the ground, is rather 
acutely angled, the enormous series of load bearing wooden beams 
that support the roof converging in a slightly offset fashion, 
overlapping the point of symmetry. At the western end of the 
nave there is a second storey veranda, constructed to give 
maximum privacy, in which the more affluent and discrete 
worshipers can view the main services. The enormous marble 
pillars that support the roof beams - several feet thick - have 
been carved into the likeliness of many people, almost like a 
totem pole. The clerestory of the Cathedral, huge, multistorey 
lead glass windows, begin about half way up the second storey and 
continue all the way to the beginning of the roof arch, 
encircling all of the western end of the Cathedral and separated 
by large stone mullions with alcoves containing small statues. 
At the end of the nave is the pulpit, immediately behind which is 
the main altar.

A Raised Altar in the Crux of a Dark Marble Cathedral~
   The high altar of the Cathedral, a somewhat large area raised 
several steps above the bulk of the cathedral, and made of 
enormous slabs of obsidian, houses both the pulpit and the main 
altar. The area is spacious, and a twin set of cathedra are set 
either side of the altar. Behind and slightly behind the altar, 
the quire, with several rising wooden rows seating about a score, 
can be seen. Even further behind the altar, a door can be 
observed, covered in many orderly runes of many types and 
tongues.

The Northern Transept~
   This is the northern transept of the Cathedral the northern 
end of the north-south running row that intersects the nave just 
before the pulpit. The air here smells faintly of some kind of 
bitter-sweet, though pleasant aroma. The pews are more widely 
spaced and are in fact cushioned - it is obvious that this is an 
area for the privileged. From here, one can see the pulpit, but 
not the altar, owing to the enormous structural pillar that 
obscures view.

The Southern Transept~
   This is the southern transept of the Cathedral; the southern 
end of the north-south running row that intersects the nave just 
before the pulpit. This particular transept seems a great deal 
more grizzly and gory than the rest of the nave, the motifs that 
adorn the walls taking a decidedly more violent turn, and the 
imagery of the many statues, carvings, and even just the decorum 
choice seems to reflect a similar disposition towards the 
gruesome. From here, one can see the pulpit, but not the altar, 
owing to the enormous structural pillar that obscures view.

The Quire ~
   This is a series of rows of wooden seats, each row back higher 
than the previous, that overlooks the high altar of the 
Cathedral. There is a plain, relatively comfortable wooden bench 
in each row, and each row is divided from the one before it by a 
knee-height wooden barrier, with a small wooden gate and a set of 
stairs up the farthest side from the nave.

The Entry to the Cathedral's Presbytery~
   This small room, made of the same marble as the rest of the 
Cathedral, is largely bare, with nothing adorning the walls and 
no furniture. On the northern wall, a staircase leads up into 
the Cathedral's spire, and to the west, a door covered in runes 
leads out back into the high altar.

The Southern Ambulatory of the Cathedral's Apse~
   The walls of this thin walkway around the Cathedral's apse, 
wide enough for perhaps three men to walk abreast, are adorned 
with many grisly looking weapons and instruments of torture, 
contained in their own alcoves and illuminated with brass fonts 
filled with oil. Some of the pieces have brief plaques showing 
their name, though most of them are ferocious looking enough not 
to need a name to terrify. There are no windows in this part of 
the Cathedral, and all the light comes from the many candles and 
oil fonts that have been lit along the path. The roof is no 
higher than a storey here, supporting some kind of rooms overhead 
from the look of the layout.

The Northern Ambulatory of the Cathedral's Apse~
   The walls of this thin walkway around the Cathedral's apse, 
wide enough for perhaps three men to walk abreast, are adorned 
with portraits, documents, and a few small statues, contained in 
their own alcoves and illuminated with brass fonts filled with 
oil. All of the pieces have small plaques under them explaining 
who or what they are. There are no windows in this part of the 
Cathedral, and all the light comes from the many candles and oil 
fonts that have been lit along the path. The roof is no higher

A Long, Decorated Hallway~
   This hallway is around thirty or forty yards long, and broad 
enough for perhaps two men to walk abreast. The floor is made of 
some kind of polished marble, which has been laid in a black, 
white, and grey motif of a vast battle. The walls, made of a 
stained dark red hardwood of some description, have many alcoves 
which contain small statues of armoured men on horseback, or in 
battle. On the walls, portraits hang, painted representations of 
many men, and some few women. The roof is relatively high, and 
bright torches hang above head height, metal cones hanging from 
the roof above them reflecting the light downwards and giving 
this hallway a rather unusual lighting.
