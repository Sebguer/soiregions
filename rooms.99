Base Room for Dwelling Zone~
The rooms in this zone are to be used STRICTLY for the master
floorplans that DWELLING objects use to create their areas.

A few things to remember. One: dwelling objects with the PITCHABLE
flag may only use one-room floorplans - tents and the like. Two:
other than that, your imagination's the limit. Floorplans can
basically be just like any other PC home you'd normally build.

After a dwelling object has cloned its floorplan into z100, the
cloned rooms can then be edited/modified to your heart's content
with regular builder commands without affecting the master, and
other dwellings of that same VNUM.

Lastly, all floorplans need to be isolated blocks of rooms -
they should NOT be linked to ANY OTHER AREA. EVER.

   Moderately-sized, the inside of this tent measures about 
fifteen feet-wide and ten feet deep. Two eight-foot high, 
vertical poles connected by a shorter ridge pole form the frame 
of this tent, supporting the canvas. The ends of the tent are 
half-conical in shape judging by the size, this tent could easily 
sleep four. In one side of the tent is a five foot-high, 
three-foot wide door with two flaps that may be tied off.

Knee-High Grass About The Farm~
   A narrow trail of packed dirt runs through knee-high grass, 
leading north to a large, battered farmhouse, the wooden planks 
of varying hues as they've been replaced over the many seasons 
the house has seen. Heavy shutters and a thick door face down 
the path, bearing the occasional notch and scrape across them. 
Either side of the trail rises up high grass, reaching to the 
knee of a man, a short cut of dirt leading to the western barn, 
large gates painted a drab red colour.

smell of animals and manure hang heavy in the air, the dirt of 
the floor warm. Dust climbs freely up the drab-red-painted walls 
of the barn, and a colony of cobwebs has claimed the sloped 
ceiling. At the eastern end of the barn, a large pair of gates 
lie, unbarred from this side, opening out onto a grassy trail.

Charred Shell of a Farmhouse~
   Untamed grass grows freely about this portion of the northern 
reaches of Ithilien, yet the picturesque countryside is ruined by 
the charred shell of a large farmhouse that juts out, the 
blackened stone base mostly intact, a short growth of fire 
ravaged wood reaching a few dismal feet into the air. Odds and 
ends of farming equipment litter the soot and ash ingrained stone 
floor, from crisped pieces of leather to old scythe heads twisted 
by the fire that tore through the farmhouse. In all directions 
the fields of Ithilien run.

Ithilien Fields Before a Squat Fort~
   The dry fields of the Ithilien come to a halt here before a 
squat fort that rises from the ground, a short dirt trail running 
to the thick wooden gate, armed figures visible as they patrol up 
and down the battlements. A steep, earthen wall forms the outer 
perimeter of this fort, at the top a wall of fire-hardened, 
tar-blackened stakes rising half a dozen feet. Inside the 
roughly circular fort, a small tower has been built, of the same 
raw, fire-proofed logs as the outer wall.

tarred logs that from a rough circle about the central tower. A 
northern door leads into the rough construction, fashioned of 
wood treated the same as the outer wall. The yard is kept clean, 
and soldiers bustle about with it, engaged in drills or moving 
supplies back and forth from the gate. A ramp of earth leads 
south up onto the battlements.

   What little room there is in this squat wooden tower is 
occupied by crude pallets and bunks, and on occasion the soldiers 
of the fort resting when not on duty. The walls have been 
fashioned crudely of wooden logs, blackened and tarred to grant 
protection against fire. A stout doorway rests in the southern 
side of the tower, opening inwards out into the marshal yard of 
the fort, and a thick ladder ends at a trapdoor, leading out onto
the top of the tower.

Atop the Squat Wooden Tower in the Fort, Overlooking the Ithilien~
   A commanding view of the Ithilien is gained from his squat 
tower, during the day allowing one to see all the way from the 
dark, looming mountain range to the east, to the massive 
sprawling Anduin river to the west. A knee-height parapet runs 
about the tower, forcing one to move with a degree of caution 
about the edge lest trip and fall down into the marshal yard 
below. A heavy brazier rests in the centre of the towertop, and 
on the southern edge a trapdoor leads downward to inside the 
construction. A series of wooden planks leads downwards to the 
north, back onto the battlements of the fort. rdesc reformat

   A packed dirt path rings a rough circle about the marshal yard

past the sharpened points of the fire-proofed trees that fashion 
the outer wall of the fortification. A steep incline of dark 
earth runs up to the battlements in all directions, the wooden 
stakes and dirt path a half dozen feet above the ground below. 
On the southern arc, a ramp leads down into the main yard of the 
fort, while opposite it on the northern side a plank walkway 
leads to atop the tower.

A Small Kitchen~
   This kitchen is small in size though capable of use for modest 
cooking as well as leaving enough space for the necessary kitchen 
equipment and furniture. The walls are a freshly-painted peach 
in hue and the floor is made of white stones, matching in color 
with that of the small fireplace and chimney rising up the 
southern wall. A stove has been placed in the far corner of the 
room and a set of shelves dominate the most of the western wall, 
set to either side of the archway which bears an ivory-colored 
linen curtain, separating the kitchen from the living room 
beyond.

Inside a Damp Cave~
   The light in this area is sketchy at best, vague and 
disorienting closer to a more truthful bend. Several scraggly 
trees have grown in front of the cave's entrance, casting any 
sunlight that manages to creep inside to be rendered strange and 
distorted. The floor itself is slickened with damp, as are the 
walls of dark, cold stone. The cave stretches farther westwards, 
what little light that is presented in the current area even more 
stifled there.

The End of a Dank Tunnel~
   The most pervasive note in this room's makeup is the heavy 
smell of mold, of wet fabric left that way for too long. 
Sleeping mats and pallets are scattered about the floor of the 
cavern, all of which are at least semi-dampened from the cave 
surroundings. The cave ends abruptly towards the western way, 
nothing but inky blackness and cold stone there. A ways to the 
east lays the entrance to the cave, any light from its mouth lost 
this deep in.

Inside the Pavillion~
   A pavillion has been set up, sturdy and well-woven cloth 
draped over wooden poles that have been stuck in the ground. The 
walls are open-air, leaving those inside sheltered from the skies 
above but still fairly vulnerable to the elements. It is quite 
roomy within, capable of holding quite a few people.

A Logged Cottage~
   This logged cottage is big enough to have two rooms, but it is 
instaed left open with a supporting beam in the middle. It have 
only one door towards the southern end and carries no windows. 
It is built in thick logs, with much skill and is sealed from 
cold and wind with moss and wood shavings. A small fireplace is 
set in the end directly adjectant the door, and straw covers the 
floor.

Inside the Mud Hut~
   Of a circular dome-shape design, this mud and wood hut is 
simple in its construction. Long, thin branches form the 
structure, dug into the soil beneath it and arc upwards to form 
the dome. Similar branches cross horizontally round the 
circumference, making it more sturdy to the elements. Packed in 
between is a thick layer of mud and on top of that lies straw, 
woven around the wooden frame to create a quite efficient 
waterproof outer layer. At the top a smoke hole opens up to the 
skies and it bears a simple, wooden door which is somewhat 
shorter than the average person.

A Cramped Room Within the Lean-To~
   This cramped room can barely hold three people, and only 
really one comfortably. The floor is of dirt, packed down and 
damp, and the low roof is at a slant, leaving more space to the 
right of the room than the left.

A Tiny Larder~
   This tiny larder has been dug out beneath the main room of the 
lean-to and can only just barely hold a human body, standing 
upright. Its main purpose, as it is slightly damp and cold, 
seems to be holding food - or, alternatively, tools, hides, etc. 
It is a storage cubby.

Within a Narrow Mineshaft~
   This narrow mineshaft delves some distance into the rock, cut 
crudely, and with no particular order or form to its 
construction. At times metallic glints are visible in the rock 
walls, and water drips from the low ceiling, making the fungus 
covered floor slippery and wet. It widens a little to the north, 
curving steeply downwards.

A Widening Mineshaft~
   The mineshaft widens considerably here, though the floor and 
walls are even rockier than they are to the south, as it twists 
down into the earth. Bit of debris make the ground treacherous, 
and the mineshaft cuts off abruptly on its curve downwards, the 
edge disappearing into darkness. The ceiling is higher, making 
it easier to move about. This place is almost roomy.

On a Ledge at the Bottom of a Shallow Drop-Off~
   This rock ledge has been cut out of the wall, a single stone 
stair leading down into darkness. Several feet below it, 
however, the darkness truncates rather abruptly by way of a 
shallow pool of stagnant cave water, and several feet above it is 
solid ground again. It would not be too hard to climb up from 
here back into the mineshaft, or down from here into the pool of 
water.

Inside a Huge Pavilion Tent~
   Glistening black walls of carefully joined bolts of silk held 
aloft by stained brown wooden poles form an opulent shelter from 
outside weathers. Brass lanterns, polished until they reflect 
their own light, shed warm illumination throughout the tent as 
they sway slightly from the cross. The ground is covered by 
sturdy woven rugs of twisted cloths of black and silver wool. On 
one end, a rectangular opening leads outside. A large, colorful 
tapestry has been hung over the opening to protect the 
inhabitants, intricate work depicting Gondorian Soldiers marching 
in rank and file behind the flag of Gondor and a banner bearing a 
black shield before a silvery grey moon.
