squirts liquid from the spout with varying force depending
how hard it is squeezed, which is clearly its function.

a multi-chambered glass alembic~
A multi-chambered glass alembic is arranged on a table by the wall.~
This alchemical device is similar to a basic alembic, albeit 
much more complex. It is made of thick, durable glass, and 
consists of several chambers connected with glass tubing. All 
of the parts can be removed, and so replaced with vessels and 
tubes of different shapes and sizes. At the center is a large 
glass circulating chamber, with arms on either side feeding the
condensed vapors back into the bottom of the chamber. The main 
chamber is fed by several retorts below it, attached by glass 
tubing. Above the circulating chamber is a condensing chamber 
or alembic, which feeds the condensate through a 
downward-sloping tube to a glass cucurbit which collects 
resulting liquid.

for holding large beakers, the other end possessing a

a tray filled with wilting carnation flowers~
A tray filled with wilting carnation flowers sits here.~
Rectangular in shape and fashioned from wood, this tray is
filled with fertile soil and carnation flowers. The leaves 
of the plants are spatula-shaped and stalked, while the stem
leaves are lance-shaped and attached directly at the base. The
wilted, dark-green leaves and stems of the plants are roughly 
hairy. The once white flowers have shrivelled up,
turned brown and gone to seed. Several clusters of curved brown
seeds can be seen at the end of the dried stems, waiting to be
collected.
