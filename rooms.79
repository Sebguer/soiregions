Oops.~
   Oops! While you were logged out, the location you had chosen 
for rest came under attack, and was seized by Gondorian or 
Mordorian forces. Luckily, you somehow managed to escape, though 
without getting a good look at who was responsible, or putting up 
much up a fight (something which you may have to explain to a 
superior). Now, you can exit this room to a road not far from a 
place of your choosing. If your character is human, and without 
a light, you are welcome to dwell here until it is daylight: just 
quit out.

Quit Room for Mordorians~
   This quit room is an Out Of Character space for Mordorian 
characters to quit out in. Nothing can be storred here, its 
purpose instead is to allow you a room to quit. Should the 
location you are in be taken by enemies while you are logged out, 
you will be loaded near Tur Edendor upon re-entry to the game, 
rather than fall automatic prisoner. However, anything you left 
inside the location is fair game.

Top of the Watchtower~
   The top of this simple watch tower has been constructed out of 
thick pine logs sawn in halve, the smooth sides facing upwards, 
and hammering around the vantage point a series of crude 
mantlets, allowing protection from any arrow fire below while 
granting a commanding view of the surroundings. On the southern 
side, a sturdy ladder leads back down to the main yard of this 
little encampment.

On the Steep Slope of the Emyn Arnen~
   Passage through here is by gripping on to cracks and holes in 
the surface of the chalky cliffs of the Emyn Arnen. Hardly an 
easy task, one could make the route between the grassy ground of 
the plateaus to atop of the log-built watch tower that blocks the 
narrow passage through the Emyn Arnen. A ring of crude mantlets 
surrounds the top of the watch tower, but these look scalable. 
Of course, for those not agile enough, the ground is but a short, 
sudden drop away.

Prisoner Room~
   This shack looks as if it is used to keep pigs, or some other 
type of lifestock in it, such as enemy prisoners and other 
desirables. The floor is fashioned cunningly out of wet, sloppy 
mud, and upon it lay a number of wet, sloppy, muddy bedrolls and 
pallets. A rickety gate leads out to the west, in to the common 
yard of the watch tower.

Cluttered Yard of a Wooden Watchtower~
   This small yard measures perhaps a dozen yards across both 
north-south and east-west, what little space there is used for 
storing piles of lumber, bags of food, and spare shields and 
arrows. A man-high fence surrounds the watch tower itself, that 
structure built out of felled trees and set to lean against the 
eastern face of one of the white cliffs of the Emyn Arnen. A 
simple wooden ladder allows one to climb to the top of the flat 
roof of the watchtower, and fences in the wooden gate open to the 
west and the south. A separate tiny shack to the east serves as 
a pen for livestock and prisoners alike.

Bear-Hide Decorated Barracks~
   The interior of the watch tower is little more than a series 
of rough beds, bunks, cots and pallets in which the garrison and 
any visitors sleep. There is little room for anything else, save 
a spartan stove to ward off the chill of evenings up here in the 
mountains, and various bear hides stretched across the log walls 
and floor, taken as trophies by the soldiers stationed here. An 
uneven door opens outwards to the south.

Top of the Windmill~
   The top of this stone windmill looks to have been recently 
cleared of a great deal of debris, shoved simply over the sides 
to clutter the ground below. This circular stone platform offers 
whoever stands on it a great view of the Ithilien, interrupted as 
it is by the occasional spinning wooden blade. A stout trapdoor 
leads inside the windmill, and the stone walls of it looks 
corroded enough that one could possibly climb down them if they 
were especially brave or foolhardy.

Climbing the Derelict Windmill~
   Clambering a ledge on the northern side of the structure or 
down the side of the derelict windmill is difficult, but by no 
means impossible: there are enough craggy handholds in the sooty 
stone, or even grabbing on to the spinning wooden blades and 
waiting till they lift one to the roof seems possible, if not 
extremely dangerous. Down leads to the ground of the Ithilien, 
while up and over a stone parapet leads to the rooftop of the 
windmill.

Prisoner Basement~
   This shack looks as if it is used to keep wheat, or some other 
type of grain in it, such as enemy prisoners and other 
undesirables. The floor is fashioned cunning out of wet, sloppy 
mud, and upon it lay a number of wet, sloppy, muddy bedrolls and 
pallets. A rickety ladder leads out to the trapdoor in the 
ceiling, in to the common floor of the derelict windmill.

Renovated Windmill Floor~
   The floor of this windmill is rather large, and looks to have 
been renovated recently. The black soot marks on the interior of 
the stone walls are found nowhere else on the wooden furniture 
assembled here. Little of the original machinery remains, save 
for a series of twisting, creaking poles, gears and pulleys 
unattached to any millstone. The furniture that does remain has 
been used to block up windows, doors, and any other entrances in 
to the windmill, leaving a clear space where sacks of supplies 
and the likes can be laid out. A trapdoor leads down in to the 
windmill's basement, and a ladder allows one to access the roof. 
One of the doors look as if it can be exited out to the Ithilien.

Sack-Padded Walls of a Makeshift Barracks~
   The interior of the derelict windmill is little more than a 
series of rough beds, bunks, cots and pallets in which the 
garrison and any visitors sleep. There is little room for 
anything else, save a spartan stove to ward off the chill of 
evenings, and various wheat and grain sacks padded along the 
walls to add some insulation to this underground barracks, 
keeping out both the damp and the cold. The interior of the 
windmill continues to lead upwards, accessible via a small 
ladder.

Quit Room for Mordorians~
   This quit room is an Out Of Character space for Mordorian 
characters to quit out in. Nothing can be storred here, its 
purpose instead is to allow you a room to quit. Should the 
location you are in be taken by enemies while you are logged out, 
you will be loaded near Tur Edendor upon re-entry to the game, 
rather than fall automatic prisoner. However, anything you left 
inside the location is fair game.

Sheltered Short Ledge of the Emyn Arnen~
   A short ledge, big enough for perhaps a half dozen people to 
stand without risk of falling, juts out from the Emyn Arnen here, 
an overhang of rock protecting the site from sunlight and the 
more extreme aspects of the elements. A view of the brown 
grasses of South Ithilien is visisble to the east, as well as a 
potentially lethal drop being in that direction. Some of the 
danger is mitigated by a low wooden fence of chopped tree stumps, 
a similar sort of staircase leading down deeper in to the cave.

Rugged Wall of the Emyn Arnen~
   The chalk-white cliffs of the Emyn Arnen loom imposingly to 
the north and the south, but this section looks climbable, should 
one be sufficiently motivated. The hilly grass of Ithilien lies 
at the base of the drop, and a cave opening appears half way up 
the mountainside.

Straw Covered Cave Floor~
   While only a narrow opening to the east leads out of this cave 
and down a steep trail lined with thorny bushes and felled logs, 
the inside is quite spacious, although chilly, only a heavy layer 
of straw laid down to help warm the cavern. Water drips from the 
rock ceiling, forming in cold pools in the corners of the cave, 
and a harsh wind often whips past the entrance, out from which 
the dry plains of Ithilien and a long, winding road can be seen 
leading north and south. Passages in the cavern lead west, down, 
and an opening leads to a larger opening.

Sack-Padded Walls of a Makeshift Barracks~
   This section of the cave has been converted to house the 
unfortunate soldiers stationed to watch over it and the road that 
passes it by. One saving grace is that despite the cramped 
conditions and the stony ceiling and walls, it is quite warm, and 
free from any obvious infestations of bugs amongst the thick 
layers of straw laid down upon the ground.

Prisoner Basement~
   This shack looks as if it is used to keep wheat, or some other 
type of grain in it, such as enemy prisoners and other 
undesirables. The floor is fashioned cunning out of wet, sloppy 
mud, and upon it lay a number of wet, sloppy, muddy bedrolls and 
pallets. A rickety ladder leads out to the trapdoor in the 
ceiling, in to the common floor of the cave.

Boardwalk Around the Top of a Treehouse~
   A rusty-hinged trapdoor gives access into the heart of this 
tree house which has been skillfully fashioned around one of the 
larger, thicker trees in the area. Its top has been roughly hewn 
and branches shaved off to leave only a bare skeleton of what was 
a tree. A hazardous boardwalk has been set up, circumnavigating 
the entirety of the tree house, a flat base for lookouts to keep 
a keen eye through the canopy and forest floor beneath. A few 
ropes and ladders have been carefully situated around the outer 
walls of the tree house here that look safe enough that one could 
probably climb down and into the tower.

Climbing the Outer Tree House~
   The chances of being able to scale this broad tree and rickety 
tree house have been somewhat increased by the permanent ladders, 
ropes and footholds set up around the walls here. A fall here 
would leave someone to plummet to the forest floor whilst a 
particular rope ladder scales the tower further and onto rickety 
boardwalks.

Prisoner Room~
   Hewn recently from the wet mud of the earth, flies and other 
insects constantly crawl through the surroundings, worms making 
their homes and spiders catching their prey. A pathetic effort 
has been made to board up the raw earth walls of this apparent 
prison, leaving them bare to the inhabitants instead. The floor 
is, for the best part, laid with old burlap sacks which are now 
partly consumed by the rich earth. An extendable ladder gives 
access to the trapdoor above.

Hollowed Out, Fortified Treehouse~
   Inside here, the windows of the tree house have been boarded 
up and bound with thick lashings of rope which only let shards of 
the daytime sunlight into the dusty room. Most noticeably, a 
tree penetrates the very center of this structure, vanishing off 
into the floors above, the shaven limbs lying messily around the 
area, many of the leaves now dead and crunchy. Food supplies 
have been set neatly against the walls and a large trapdoor opens 
out to the floor beneath.

Stark Barracks~
   A makeshift barracks has been laid out here in this lower 
floor of the tree house and it seems little effort has gone into 
any comforts or amenities. Padded bedrolls spread out in neat 
and stark lines, a few belongings strewn among them. The walls 
are un-insulated, the thick wood of the barricaded tree house and 
a small bin-fire in the center of this room providing the only 
source of heat for any residents here. The atmosphere reeks of 
sawdust and refuse and continues to the higher reaches of this 
tree house, accessible by a rope ladder.

Top of the Watchtower~
   The top of this simple watch tower has been constructed out of 
thick pine logs sawn in halve, the smooth sides facing upwards, 
and hammering around the vantage point a series of crude 
mantlets, allowing protection from any arrow fire below while 
granting a commanding view of the surroundings. On the southern 
side, a sturdy ladder leads back down to the main yard of this 
little encampment.

On the Steep Slope of the Emyn Arnen~
   Passage through here is by gripping on to cracks and holes in 
the surface of the chalky cliffs of the Emyn Arnen. Hardly an 
easy task, one could make the route between the grassy ground of 
the plateaus to atop of the log-built watch tower that blocks the 
narrow passage through the Emyn Arnen. A ring of crude mantlets 
surrounds the top of the watch tower, but these look scalable. 
Of course, for those not agile enough, the ground is but a short, 
sudden drop away.

Prisoner Room~
   This shack looks as if it is used to keep pigs, or some other 
type of lifestock in it, such as enemy prisoners and other 
desirables. The floor is fashioned cunning out of wet, sloppy 
mud, and upon it lay a number of wet, sloppy, muddy bedrolls and 
pallets. A rickety gate leads out to the east, in to the common 
yard of the watch tower.

Cluttered Yard of a Wooden Watchtower~
   This small yard measures perhaps a dozen yards across both 
north-south and east-west, what little space there is used for 
storing piles of lumber, bags of food, and spare shields and 
arrows. A man-high fence surrounds the watch tower itself, that 
structure built out of felled trees and set to lean against the 
western face of one of the white cliffs of the Emyn Arnen. A 
simple wooden ladder allows one to climb to the top of the flat 
roof of the watchtower, and fences in the wooden gate open to the 
north and the south. A seperate tiny shack to the west serves as 
a pen for livestock and prisoners alike.

Bear-Hide Decorated Barracks~
   The interior of the watch tower is little more than a series 
of rough beds, bunks, cots and pallets in which the garrison and 
any visitors sleep. There is little room for anything else, save 
a spartan stove to ward off the chill of evenings up here in the 
mountains, and various bear hides stretched across the log walls 
and floor, taken as trophies by the soldiers stationed here. An 
uneven door opens outwards to the west.

Quit Room for Mordorians~
   This quit room is an Out Of Character space for Mordorian 
characters to quit out in. Nothing can be storred here, its 
purpose instead is to allow you a room to quit. Should the 
location you are in be taken by enemies while you are logged out, 
you will be loaded near Tur Edendor upon re-entry to the game, 
rather than fall automatic prisoner. However, anything you left 
inside the location is fair game.

Quit Room for Mordorians~
   This quit room is an Out Of Character space for Mordorian 
characters to quit out in. Nothing can be storred here, its 
purpose instead is to allow you a room to quit. Should the 
location you are in be taken by enemies while you are logged out, 
you will be loaded near Tur Edendor upon re-entry to the game, 
rather than fall automatic prisoner. However, anything you left 
inside the location is fair game.

In the Half-Ruined Loft of the Fortified Farmhouse~
   This broad loft is roughly twice as large east to west as it 
is north to south, but the steepled roof and wooden floorboards 
cover only half of that area, gaping holes in booth floor and 
ceiling a constant hazard here. A quaint view of South Ithilien 
can be glimpsed from up here, of a pond to the east, and a large 
oak forest to the north. Rough mantlets have been constructed 
about the edge of roof, allowing archers to snipe without risk at 
any who passes nearby.

Scaling the Farmhouse Walls~
   Although the farmhouse has been recently fortified against 
attack with new stone and timber defenses, this has left it 
somewhat easy to scale. Of course, clambering up the wall of a 
long-ruined farmhouse still carries with it risks, and the ground 
below is a significant distance away, just as mossy stones seem 
suddenly common. The climb ends at a series of barred farmhouse 
windows.

Cramped Livestock Cage~
   This large cage was originally intended to herd lifestock, but 
is equally good at keeping in prisoners or other undesirables 
dragged to the retrofitted farmhouse for keeping. The bars are 
set far too narrow together for even the skinniest of goblins to 
slip through, and the tops are cruelly spiked and barbed. A door 
of bars opens out, leading to the common room of the farmhouse to 
the south.

Interior of a Retrofitted Farmhouse~
   Whilst once the centre for a large, extended family of 
Gondorians to farm and till the surrounding land, now the stone 
walls of this farmhouse have been propped up and fitted with 
thick wooden logs and mismatching, darker stones, the interior 
walls removed and the rotting roof propped up with wooden beams, 
all to make more room for the supplies of food, weapon racks, 
wounded beds, and sparring rings required by the soldiers that 
fortify this location. A broad trapdoor leads down in to the 
farmhouse's cellar, and a stone staircase leads up to the ruined 
loft. A large animal cage is set on the northern side of the 
farmhouse. Numerous exits lead out of the structure, but all are 
heavily barred and secured.

Cellar Barracks~
   This cellar probaby saw more peaceful uses before the end of 
the Watchful Peace, but now it has been gutted, and instead 
arranged with bunks and refortified wooden walls, clearly 
intending to house a number of people here to protect the 
fortified farmhouse above, accessible via a large trapdoor in the 
northern end of the the cellar. A thick stone staircase leads up 
to the trapdoor, and the floor is paved of the same odd-grey 
stones.

A Large, Wide Cavern~
   This large cavern has been dug straight out of the black rock 
of the earth, with great, standing pillars left untouched to 
provide support for the high ceiling and curving walls. This 
cavern's floor is rocky and uneven; rocks jut up from the floor 
along the walls. There is a heavy door set into the rock 
ceiling, its hinge thick and its oaken slats thicker; despite 
this, there is a certain crudeness to the door: there are wide 
slits between the wooden slats, where one could fire off bolts 
and arrows into the room above.

Cluttered, Noisy Cavern~
   The noisy clatter of instruments employed in various 
professions continuously echo throughout this cavern. Seeming 
far from a natural formation this cavern still possesses the 
scrapes of picks and shovels upon its slimy walls, slippery and 
wet to the touch. At the peak of the cave is a narrow 
ventilation shaft allowing some of the smoke which is densely 
packed within this expanse to escape, the only instance of fresh 
air pulled from the northern tunnel. Supporting this makeshift 
cavern are a series of fire-hardened logs, drowned in tar to 
prevent erosion, and are propped up at several points where the 
cave hangs lowest, hammer marks still present from their 
positioning. 
   On the south-eastern end of the cave is a foundry-works, forge 
constantly illuminating the cavern. From the eastern side of the 
cave wafts the strong smell of tanning oils, decaying flesh, and 
leather, which is tucked behind a rocky conclave, hiding most of 
the work within. Present at the western corner of the cave is a 
large wooden shack, from which the sawing, chopping, and smell of 
lumber can be detected.

A Dank, Crudely Hacked Cell~
   This small cave has been hollowed out narrowly from the main 
cavern, a thick wooden door set between the two to separate them. 
It is cramped and water trickles in from between the dirt and 
stone ceiling of the cell, running down along slimey stone walls 
to lend this room a humid, dank stink. A pile of straw lies in 
one corner, water-logged, and a few muddy puddles have gathered 
in the corners.

Boss Cavern~
   The contours and lines of this chamber have a slightly shaky 
feel to them, as if the builders were trying to recapture an 
image rather than dig a cave anew. This chamber appears to have 
been carved recently from the thick, surrounding rock. A heavy 
stench of orc lingers over the place that would offend any 
creature of a daintier taste. Tattered banners bearing poorly 
sewn skulls hang from the walls, while at the back of the room 
stands a dais of sorts, upon which sits a crude throne carved of 
rotting wood. Piled beneath the throne lie human skulls in a 
path leading out of the room, some still fresh with blood, or 
gore that has yet to have been licked away by a passing orc.

Filthy Orkish Kennel~
   This low ceiling cavern appears to be somewhat natural in its 
formation, its walls mostly devoid of pick marks. The floors are 
thickly mudded, and have a layer of straw tossed over in a half 
attempt to absorb the constantly moistured floor. The waft of 
fecal matter, and urine permeates this area, strong enough to 
force a non-yrcish passer-by into gagging. Rickety stalls flank 
the southern and eastern wall of this cave, each fixed with 
swing-doors that provide entry to the stalls and their occupants. 
Within each stall is a section of shelving which provides 
supplies for each of the occupied beasts, and located in the 
floor of each as well is a feeding, and watering trough.

Drab Armory~
   Large enough to hold either goods or prisoners, this cavern is 
rather warm, the northern rock wall especially so. The humid air 
is allowed to filter freely from under the stout door covering 
the narrow southern entrance, yet there is no other exit from 
this space. A secure lock on the door keeps it firmly in place.

A Stone-Columned Feasting Chamber~
   This vast cavernous chamber sports a great, deeply dug, pit in 
the very center of a series of great stone pillars that stretch 
from ceiling to floor and are easily as thick as tree-trunks. 
Several long slabs of stone that was likely hacked from the 
chamber itself during the digging, are arrayed around the fire 
pit in manner of bench seats for many yrkish bodies. Scattered 
crude wooden tables and wagon-wheels slapped over stone boulders 
with wood planks lain out across them hold broad array of random 
objects and are occupied by black-bloods at various sport; from 
mumbly-peg, dicing and cards, to more crude bouts of 
arm-wrestling and even a few toppled over by scuffles ongoing.

A Rough Cave~
   Formed naturally from the walls of the main cavern, this 
conclave is rather snug fitting, and does not produce much room 
for movement beyond the placement of the utensils, shelves, and 
racks which decorate this area. Within the center of the room is 
a workbench; the entire place reeks.

A Hastily-Built Woodworking Shack~
   Entirely wood in composition this shack has obviously been 
hastily built and sits at the end of a stubby tunnel, gaps 
present between the flanks of timber which compose this shelter. 
Within are various implements used in the crafts of woodworking. 
Positioned upon the walls are a series of shelves which have been 
carelessly nailed up, and often shake when open or closed. 
Tucked into another corner of the shack is a workbench.

Hazy Foundry-Works~
   Sweltering heat is constantly exerted by the forge present 
within this section of the cavern, only ventilation from the 
smoke and fumes produced by this forge well above at the caves 
peak. A pair of anvils lay positioned on either corner of the 
area, behind them a cooling tub to further assist in the process 
of working medals. Upon the walls are a series of shelves 
obviously meant to hold tools employed within this area.

Smoky, Sooty, Roughly-Hewn Chamber~
   This cavern chamber isn't exactly broad, but rather deep and 
with a high ceiling. Myriad of crude hooks, spikes, and chains 
dangling from the cavern roof low enough to be reached bearing 
all manner of yrkish delights from raw stringy ropes of still 
bloody meat, to whole roast sides of hog, to near liquid dripping 
rotted chunks of unidentifiable foods. The stone walls 
themselves appear blackened, darker than most of the rest of the 
connecting tunnels, sooty and charred more heavily near the 
grouting stoves covered in dirty, crusty, cooking instruments. 
Several small embrasures, flattened outcroppings of stone forming 
shelves near to where the ovens sit, have been carved out of the 
living rock itself. Crudely thrown together larders with uneven 
shelving hold array of ingredients as well as host of vermin who 
have found that haven though likely to become part of the meals 
as well. Near the very furthers back reaches of the cavern, an 
audible trickling can be heard, leading one's attention to a 
shallow pool of gathering water in a depression of the stone.

Warm, Straw-Strewn Cave~
   Bedded down thickly with straw this area has obviously been 
padded away to keep a fairly consistent temperature within the 
cave, as compared to other comparments of this network of 
tunnels. Various forms of caged animals line the walls, all in 
different stages of raising. It is fairly obvious that this 
section of the cave is used to select raising of captured beasts.

Smelly Tunnel~
   This tunnel is obviously not the product of a professional 
effort. It is, however, as utilitarian as a tunnel can be, made 
to provide space for somebody to crawl in two directions and 
nothing else. It is nothing more than a long, roughly-cut 
circular tube, surrounded on all sides by dirt and bits of rock. 
From the west wafts the unpleasant odor of fecal matter and 
urine.

Abrupt End in the Tunnl~
   The end of the tunnel rests only slightly past a thick slab of 
rock, chisel marks and cracks adorning its surface. Where the 
slab breaks off, dirt and open space begin, surrounding a 
man-sized hole just large enough to crawl out of. To the west, 
the dark, earthen tunnel continues.
