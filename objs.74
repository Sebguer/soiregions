falchion xUNIQUE xExpert_xQuality bone-hilted steel METAL~
a heavy, bone-hilted steel falchion~
A heavy steel falchion lies here, its hilt of carved bone.~
   Thick, dusky steel makes up this falchion's wide blade and, 
though its single edge has been sharpened to a razor-edge, 
appears to rely more on the strength of the wielder to deliver 
crushing chops and blows. Its hilt is of thick, carved bone 
wrapped by undyed leather strips and a wide, staring eye has been 
engraved into its circular, iron pommel, outlined in tarnished 
brass. The quillions are straight, short, and made of a darker 
steel than the blade. Twisting patterns have been carved into 
the metal crossguard and into the bone hilt, while jagged runes 
have been etched along one side of the thick steel blade of the 
falchion, at times catching in the light.

skullcap spiked dual cheek guards METAL~
a spiked skullcap with dual cheek guards~
A dark-iron skullcap with dual cheek guards lies here, adorned by spikes.~
   This skullcap is forged of a single, thick piece of dark iron. 
A large spike protrudes over the brow, jutting outwards, and 
smaller spikes of bronze adorn its cap. Dual cheek guards, as 
well as a short noseguard, run down from the large protruding 
spike to form a sort of face-plate, leaving large squares for the 
eyes to glint through, and a rectangular, empty space beneath the 
noseguard, between the cheek guards. It appears, despite its 
spiked decoration, to have been well-crafted and quite resilient 
to blows.

a grisly bone totem~
A grisly totem fashioned from bones stands here.~
   The centre of this grisly totem of bones is a collection of 
long thigh bones lashed together with sinew and crude twine, 
covered in jagged runes and sigils inked with blood. Around this 
spire, a dozen off-shots of sharpened bones protrude, dried blood 
covering these. Scores of smaller bones from hands and feet of 
any number of animals have been tied to the totem, each bearing a 
different rune upon them.

a throbbing red gem~
A dull red gem throbs with an unnatural light.~
   This gem appears to be an ordinary ruby, save for the dull, 
hellish red light that shines from within it, the gem itself 
seeming to throb and expand and contract, as is something was 
moving about inside of it.

a faceted diamond with a hole through the centre~
A faceted diamond lies here, a hole punctured clean through the centre of it.~
   This small gemstone is a transparent, high-quality diamond, 
but despite the rock's legendary strength something has driven a 
hole straight down through the centre of the stone. Strangely, 
the diamond bears no cracks or breakages from the hole, looking 
instead to have been naturally formed.

A dark, greasy, corroded metal amulets lies here, a glyph carved upon it.~
   This amulet is made up of a dark, greasy, corroded iron chain, 
upon which a dark, greasy, corroded iron pendant has been 
threaded through. The amulet smells vaguely of rotting flesh, 
and upon both sides of it a glyph has been carved in to it, 
looking somewhat like a circle punctured by four jagged lines 
from the top of it.

morningstar MASTER_QUALITY fiendish icy-blue-hued Zirakzigil UNIQUE_PNARODAR METAL~
a fiendish, icy-blue-hued morningstar~
A cruelly-spiked morning-star, hued icy blue lies here on the floor.~
   Composed of an icy-blue material, this morning-star has been 
masterfully crafted. Set at close to three feet in length, its 
haft has been tightly wrapped in a similarly blue leather though 
it may, on closer inspection, show a few signs of use. Even so, 
the wrap remains tight around the thick handle and a number of 
poignant, cruel spikes jut from the weapon's bulging head. The 
spikes usually appear well-polished, enhancing the cool blue 
which emanates this delicately made piece. Engraved deeply all 
over the weapon's bulbous head appear to be intricate scenes of 
battle and warfare, swordsmen, archers and horses all depicted on 
a corpse-strewn battlefield.

a pair of spider-black-hued steel gauntlets~
A pair of blackened, fine steel gauntlets lies here, forgotten.~
   These fine gauntlets have been masterfully crafted from a 
blackened steel. Small plates interlock to give the wearer a 
decent flexibility in their hands and leather wrapping lies 
beneath to stop the dark metal from tearing away at the skin. 
Upon each minor plate is engraved a tiny, intricate scene of 
warfare. Horses, archers and swordsmen line the corpse-strewn 
battlefield as arrows and blood fly up into the lifeless air.
