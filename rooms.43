A Private Yard~
   Sectioned off with tall wooden posts, this yard continues out 
from the side of the longhouse stretching eastwards. Along the 
northern side, markers run at even intervals. Years of damage, 
clearly caused by arrow-fire have taken their toll upon the 
wooden fence. Off to the south end of the yard, a raised 
sparring ring is set up.
   A door to the west leads back into the longhouse.

A Tiny Chamber~
   Barely large enough for someone to fill this space in a 
crouch, this small room is dug into the very ground the longhouse 
was built upon. Capable of holding perhaps a chest or two and 
other small items, the space is damp, packed hard with clay. A 
small opening leads into the above room.

Before A Large, Weathered Longhouse~
   A wide, dirt path branches off from the road to the north 
leading up to just before the doors of a large, weathered 
longhouse. The area here is mostly sparse of vegetation a few 
stubborn bushes sprouting up here and there along the area but 
mostly, what surrounds the structure are rocks and dirt. Further 
south of the building, more longhouses can be seen.

In the Main Living Area of the Longhouse~
   Thick, sturdy logs compose the walls of this rather large 
living area of the longhouse, the wood worn but still sturdy and 
well-chinked. The ceiling rises high to a peaked roof and a set 
of wooden steps in the far corner of the room lead up to what can 
be seen of a small loft. Three windows covered by faded curtains 
are set in the northern wall, allowing sunlight to filter in 
during the day while a fireplace of river rocks and an old 
lantern provide lighting here during the evening. To the east 
and west, hallways branch out further into the longhouse while a 
southern arch leads into the kitchen.

A Stone-Flag-Floored Kitchen~
   Unlike the rest of the longhouse which is floored with wood, 
grey stones have been fitted together underfoot to help prevent 
the spread of cooking fire. The same dark stones make up the 
walls here with the exception of the ceiling which is made with 
old but sturdy wood. A large hearth dominates the southern wall, 
and when lit, it warms the room quite easily.

made of worn floorboards that creak under one's weight though 
they are still yet sturdy as the thick logs that make up the

ivory curtain while a door to the east leads back out into the

the average man would have to hunch here. At one point, the roof 
slopes downward so much that the wall rises only a few inches 
above the head of the few cots that have been set up here in this 
makeshift treatment area. A single lantern hangs higher upon one 
of the walls, providing soft lighting for those housed here.

of the longhouse are symbols from each guild - an iron-wrought 
mounting of crossed picks, a life-like wooden mount of wheat 
stalks, a stone stag in regal pose, and a tree with high-reaching 
branches. A small awning has been erected over a sturdy door, 
providing a bit of shelter from the elements. Many people

from the fresh building work. The walls are decorated with an 
odd assortment of worn tools of the Guild's various trades while 
a wooden chandelier hangs from the ceiling. The floor is 
well-polished, featuring an intricate pattern of various wood

   Set into a corner of the longhouse, this room obviously serves 
more for storage than for study or sleep - the walls and floor 
bare save shelves and bins. Chips and dents mar the walls, as if 
weapons had been throw into or against them. It smells faintly 
of pine and wet fur, and the simple wooden door leads back into 
the often noisy and chaotic men's barracks beyond.

over muddied ground. One wagon, wheels long since rotted, has

in ragged and provided little shelter there.

Southeastern Market Square~

walls, this section of the market is rundown, with only the 
slimmest of planks bridging the gaps between each stall or tent, 
sparing those who travel here from the muddy, refuse-laden 
grounds. A few ragged peddlers hustle trinkets and baubles as 
customers come and go to poorly-built stalls and tattered tents. 
   The road winds out of the market to the northwest, while directly
north lies the center of the market itself.

in between. An open-front stall welcomes those selling all kinds 
of meat, bartering off the pieces to customers.

   Cluttered tents and stalls line almost on top of each other in 
this cramped market space. During daylight hours the area is 
crowded with fresh produce and busy customers while the 
shopkeepers shout out prices and display their wares. To the 
south, the great cedar tree can be seen, partially blocking the 
watchtower. Set into the ground and carved of stone are the 
guild symbols, A tree to the north, a noble stag to the east, 
crossed picks to the west, and a stalk of wheat to the south.

A Martial Yard Before a Sturdy Watchtower~
   A large yard of stomped dirt and the occasional patch of grass 
stretches out here. Weapon racks filled with training gear and a 
few benches stand along the edges of the field. In the middle 
there's a large sparring ring where one can find activity as long 
as it's daylight. Towards the north a pair of large double-doors 
lead into a large tower, judging by the conditions of the stones 
the tower has been newly erected. Towards the west is a smaller, 
iron-banded door which lead into a simply wooden barrack. Along 
the tower heading east is a wide dirt trail.

A Cluttered Common Area~
   The musty stench of sweat and dirt drifts through the air. A 
newly constructed wooden floor lies naked, without rugs or hides, 
but on the walls hang several simple pieces of thick cloth in 
different colors, both for decoration and for keeping the warmth. 
From the ceiling hangs a simple iron ring filled with candles, 
spreading a soft light around the room. Tables and chairs have 
been scattered about the room, a few shelves along the walls and 
a fireplace built into the southern wall. One can head out 
towards the east as well as going north and west.

A Table-Lined Mess Hall~
This enormous hall must take up most of the first floor of the 
tower. The slightly vaulted ceiling is high up in the air, thick 
beams of fire-hardened oak keeping the entire structure steady. 
A huge, iron chandelier hangs from the high ceiling, spreading a 
comfortable light throughout the hall. Several long tables and 
benches are placed in the middle of the room, giving the soldiers 
a place to sit and eat. Banners and cloth sceneries are hanging 
along the cold stone walls with a few iron candle-holders. A 
wide fireplace spreads light and warmth, built into the eastern 
wall and before it lies two large bear rugs. One can find 
watchmen bustling about this mess hall at all hours of the day. 
There is an open arch leading north and another leading west. In 
the northeastern corner there's a wide, spiraling staircase 
leading up to the next floor and down to the basement.

A Small Healer's Area~
   Unlike the mess hall to the east, this room is small and dimly 
lit. Stone makes up the ceiling, floor and walls however, thick 
fur-rugs lie along the cold floor and gobelin tapestries hang 
from the walls to dim the echo, offer some warmth in all this 
cold. A small fireplace sit in the eastern wall, kettles and 
stands to roast and cook things on scattered around it. The 
southern wall is filled with medicine cabinet and shelves, 
holding an array of items for medicinal use, while the northern 
wall holds half a dozen simple cots for the ill. There's a sweet 
smell in the air, the entire room being warm and almost cozy.

enormous fireplace with room to roast several pigs at once, takes 
up most of the western wall. The walls, floor and ceiling are

feet and the cold walls are covered in thick cloth tapestries. 
From the flat stone ceiling hangs a large iron chandelier which

create a narrow rampart. The walkway leads from the top of the 
tower onto the palisades, high above the ground below. There is 
a low wooden railing running along the rampart, perhaps reaching 
a grown man to the knees.

A Small, Officers' Quarters~
   This room is much smaller then the barracks through the 
northern door. Yet it is large enough to hold a few beds along 
the walls, two desks in the middle of the room and various other 
pieces of simple furniture. Long iron candlesticks stand on 
various places on the ground to provide a dim light to this shard 
office. A small fireplace has been built into the western wall 
and before it lies a fine bearskin rug. Towards the east is a 
thick, iron-enforced door which leads onwards.

Basement Surrounded by Jail Cells~
   A narrow staircase has led down to this small, cold basement. 
Torches are fixed to the walls between the three thick, 
iron-banded doors. Each door has a small iron-bared window at 
the top and a solid wooden hatch at the bottom that can only be 
opened from the outside. A desk stands in the middle of the 
room, in which it normally sits a guard. Next to the staircase 
leading up are a couple of chests on the floor and a few pegs on 
the walls.

Path Around Tower~
   The wide, dirt path curves around the tower, leading north and 
west. Scraggly tufts of weed seems ever present among the grass 
surrounding the path. Part of the area is shaded from above by a 
wide wooden rampart that connects the upper floor of the tower to 
the palisade in the east. The further north you go the stronger 
the smell of hay and manure grows, while to the south the sound 
of men hollering and wooden weapons clashing echo out. A few 
long lamp-poles stand at either side of the path, evenly spaced 
and spreading a soft light during the hours of the night.

A Small Stables~
   The smell of hay and manure is thick in here, the sound of 
horses neighing and snorting coming from several of the stalls. 
Despite seeming to have been newly erected, these stables are 
already worn and well-used. Several stalls line the walls, 
occupied by horses of every breed. A small but sturdy wooden 
ladder leads up to a hayloft at the far side of the stables. The 
ground is hard dirt, kept as clean as possible by the recruits 
that bustle about the area.

A Low-Ceilinged Hayloft~
   An old rickety ladder leads up to the center of this hay loft. 
The air ever lingers with a strong musty scent of hay and straw. 
Taking up the entire southern end of the loft, hay and straw 
bales are stacked, though many rather loosely. At no point do 
the bales reach more than waist high, and in many places, they 
have come undone and a pile of loose straw and hay remains. 
Across from the hay, only a bare wooden floor remains. Many 
pieces of loose hay or straw are strewn about, ever escaping a 
broom. The wooden rafters and support beams are old and many 
easily give way to splinters. The ceiling occasionally leaks 
during a storm, and not even a close inspection can reveal many 
repairs to the roof. Windows have been cut into the sides, to 
allow in light, but no glass has ever been set in the large 
openings and the elements outside often find their way in.

At the Far End of the Longhouse~
   Several rows of rickety bunk beds, a few shelves and other 
furniture cause the room to look extremely cluttered, filled to 
the brim with things. However at closer inspection it is evident 
that the barracks have been decorated with some precision, 
everything seeming to have it's place to make sure one can walk 
around freely without bumping into anything. Iron candlesticks 
sit fixed to the walls, spreading a soft light at the darkest 
hours of the night while a few small windows spread light during 
the day. Along the northern wall sits a small fireplace, 
spreading a bit of warmth. To the west is a sturdy wooden door 
with a large lock on it, the only other way out is back to the 
south.

A large hearth dominates one wall, lit to perpetually keep the 
room warm while a simple, pinewood bar runs the length of another 
wall. The room has quite a rustic feel, dirt and a bit of grass 
underfoot upon creaking floorboards while mostly farmers and a 
few travellers move through the room which is not overly 
patroned.

but otherwise, the area seems bare as a few weeds grow in the 
ground with patches of grass. The inn itself seems rather plain,

moderately-sized living area, well-chinked with obvious 
craftsmanship to keep out the elements. The room itself has been 
divided as an area in the corner has been cleared for cooking, a 
stove set against one wall with a small hearth nearby, the floor 
around it made of stone to prevent the spread of fire. The rest 
of the room is not new, but seems cozy nonetheless, furniture and 
rustic decorations giving this space a homey feeling.

the doorstep of a rather small cottage, the home rustic and 
painted with dull, green colour. Around the doorframe and window 
though, newly-painted white decorates the wood, hinting that the 
house is indeed occupied and well-maintained. To the east, the 
path leads back to the group of cottages gathered around the

keeping the air moist while the nearby waterfall rages below, the 
water crashing loudly like thunder against the rocks and into the 
waters of the brook. Along the brook's edge the ground seems to 
have been pulled away unnaturally, exposing a deep clay pit.

Before A Longhouse In A State Of Disrepair~
   Faded stains and intricate chipped carvings are imbued into 
the timber supporting the bulking frame of a massive longhouse 
looming perilously to the east. Brush and grass grows wildly at 
its base, slowly creeping its way in soft patches towards an 
arched and masterfully constructed double-doorway which sits 
beneath a dust-laden stained glass window, arching overhead and 
set with colors of red and green, the faint images of foul beasts 
and those who are set upon slaying them victoriously. Off to the 
southern side of the longhouse, caught in a twisting mixture of 
grass and flowery undergrowth is a single, desolate bench, long 
since forgotten in its material solitude.

articulate repose. Lustrous stained-glass windows are portioned 
in half-circled arc's over the substantial double-doorway 
beneath. Each wall is constructed of high-stacked logs, expertly 
notched together in a criss-cross pattern doubling as structural 
support and rising high towards the equidistant slopes of the 
roof above. To the south of the longhouse is a rutted pit of mud 
and earth encircled with stones, a large wooden sparring pell set 
off to its side.

   Well-trimmed bushes and a painstakingly organized garden are 
set about the exterior of a quaint cottage caught within their 
twiggy meanderings, casting easily identifiable differentiation 
between this patch of land and the rest of the plateau 
surrounding. A small stone chimney pipes up from centrally 
triangulated roof which drapes over the four walls beneath in 
protective shadowing. Two small, square windows of hazy glass 
are set to either side of the simple doorway leading within, led 
to by a trampled dirt pathway lined with rock and stone.

Before A Grand, Oak-Wood Cottage~
   A path of slabbed rock imbued into the ground beneath snakes 
its way up an incline in the plateau and towards a emerging cabin 
to the north, grand in stature and built with the an air of 
haughty exceptionalism. A triagonal outcropping juts forth from 
the main body of the cabin, clear windows portioned off in 
rectangles dominating the walled face above the eminent 
double-doors below. Lesser outcroppings of similar design and 
function are set to either side, each providing a fogged window 
into the world within and set above the main body of the cabin, 
corresponding in comparative repose to the rest and constructed 
of long logs of solid oak supported intermittently by stone 
supports. To the side and back of the cabin are several large 
bushes overlapping one another.

Amidst a Complex System of Stables~
   Upon entering, it's clear this area is used as stables - used 
for housing horses and maintaining their care. To the west, the 
village markets can be seen, and to the east, a small wooden door 
has been planted for access beyond. This specific area however 
is a complex maze of wooden gates and fences. Horses of all 
sizes are boarded up and being taken care of. Animal feed is 
stacked in several piles under a structure consisting of three 
walls and a sloped roof. The sounds of snorts, grunts, and 
occasional whinny drift out sporadically at all hours, and a 
musky odor seems to hang in the air.

A Small, Rustic Living Area~
   This rustic living area is old and dusty, with walls paneled 
in dark, scratched wood and a cold stone floor that is marred and 
dull, reflecting absolutely no light. The ceiling is higher than 
normal, with wide, barred windows to the east, allowing sunshine 
to fill the room during the daytime. The room has a light, airy 
feel to it - but a strong musty smell lingers in the air. A lone 
door has been fixed into the western wall, its hinges old and 
rusty-- barely functional. Positioned in the northernmost wall, 
an ancient staircase of wood leads upstairs into an airy loft.

A Low-Ceilinged Loft~
   Fitting into the triangle of the roof, this attic has been 
meticulously and neatly refitted into comfortable living 
quarters. A layer of straw insulation has been carefully secured 
with hides and heavy cloth into the parallel bars supporting the 
sloped roof . The latched vertical tile-glassed windows built 
into both sides of the roof let in adequate light during daytime. 
The walls are covered with dark-stained panels and into one 
corner a small fireplace has been built from stone. A sloping 
staircase of old, timeworn wood leads downstairs into an open, 
rustic living area.

Before the Large Guild House~
   A wide awning protrudes from the halfway mark on this 
two-story building, providing shade and protection from the 
elements for those gathered close to the Guild House. Though the 
building is well-built of steady craftsmanship, the gaudy and 
uncoordinated coloring of the house detracts from its appearance. 
One of the outside walls is painted a garish yellow, striking in 
its opposition to the blander rust color covering the rest of the 
house. Some elegance remains in the structure, however, in the 
elaborately carved double-doors leading into the house, each door 
scored with lines, and intricately carved with the symbols of the 
four guilds: the stag, the pick, the tree, and the wheat shaft. 
A simple iron bell hangs near the doorway, chain awaiting a tug.

A Large, Trophy-Decorated Commons~
   Numerous preserved heads of animals ranging from moose, stag, 
and many more have been hung upon plaques that decorate the walls 
of this rather large commons. The furniture that decorates this 
spacious room is of the best, northman quality, and four, low 
tables surrounded by fur hides serve as seats for any wishing it, 
the surface of the tables carved with symbols of the various 
guilds. In the center of the guild hall is a stone-lined firepit 
to which the tables have been arranged around while a little 
hatch in the ceiling can be opened by pulling upon an iron chain, 
allowing smoke to drift out of the building. 
   Various hallways branch from this room as well as a set of 
stairs that lead up to the second floor of the Guild Hall.

   This hallway is rather wide, and seems fairly new, the 
floorboards well-fitted together. However, the walls to either 
side seem somehow older, the wood scratched with age and 
curiously weather-worn though visible effort has been made to 
spruce them up, a fresh coating of paint covering the older wood. 
A few lanterns hang to either side of the hall, offering ample 
lighting. North leads into the leatherworkers' workshop while 
south into the farmers' workshop.

A Table-Lined Kitchen and Dining Hall~
   Tables and more tables have been arranged everywhere around 
this hall, piles of fur placed around each for seating. There is 
a cacophony of sound here, voices of many guildspeople drifting 
throughout the House as the wander in and out of the dining hall 
where most of the sounds originate. The far end of the room is 
cleared of debris and is quite clean as it is obviously the 
kitchen, a large firepit built into the ground where a gigantic 
cauldron perpetually hangs over. There is another fireplace 
built into the wall for more cooking with a stove placed nearby 
and shelves lining every inch of wall space in that corner. 
   A narrow door leads north, out to a yard behind the Guild 
House while south leads into the busy commons.

while displayed above them are various, preserved animal heads. 
There are many bins and shelves placed here containing a large 
amount of tanned leathers prepared into cloaks while some are 
left ready for crafting. A large table dominates the center of

having recently been used.

other tools needed to tend Angost's fertile fields. In the 
center of the room is a smaller worktable and set to the sides 
are butter churns and other things needed for processing farmed 
goods and resources. This room seems more spacious than the 
other workrooms in the Guild House, painted a bright shade of 
sunny yellow while baskets of dried fruits and other harvested 
foods sit on display along the top tiers of the many shelves.

unfinished tools lie en mass within crates that are stacked all 
over the room. To the south, a door leads back to the hallway 
while north leads to an outdoor forge.

covers nearly everything here, making it somewhat hard to breathe

   A wooden shelter has been erected here behind the Guild Hall 
taking up most of the room at the end of the dirt-filled yard. 
There are pelts lined up everywhere drying and other leather 
hides stretched out, hanging from hooks placed in the beams that 
run overhead. The shelter is open-air, allowing the stink fumes 
from the tanning to rise up and away and the crafting area is 
rather cluttered, many tools and raw hides piled upon each other, 
ready for working.

that have been planted along the stone wall that lines this whole

plumes of smoke rising high above into the open air of the yard.

Before a Rustic, Brown-Painted Cottage~
   This yard is filled with knee-high, green grass, the dirt 
beneath soft and fertile. A short, dirt-trodden path leads up to 
the doorstep of a rather small cottage, the home rustic and left 
unpainted, merely the vibrant brown of the logs. Though simple 
in make, the cottage is rather sturdy and has been kept clean. 
To the east, the path leads back to the group of cottages 
gathered around the brook.

   Large, pinewood logs make up the walls and and ceiling of this

craftsmanship to keep out the elements. The room itself has been 
divided as an area in the corner has been cleared for cooking, a 
stove set against one wall with a small hearth nearby, the floor 
around it made of stone to prevent the spread of fire. The rest 
of the room is not new, but seems cozy nonetheless, furniture and 
rustic decorations giving this space a homey feeling.

The Hole Store-Room~
   This old earth-packed basement room is little more than a few 
sanded planks lining the walls and an old oak wood door leading 
back into the fray of the cellar beyond. Several knotty wood 
shelves sit along the confines of this room, the cool air of the 
underground providing an excellent place for storage. Only one 
or two people can comfortably fit within this room, the low 
ceiling and haphazard construction not allowing for taller 
occupants. An earthy smell hangs constantly on the air.

A Simple Dust-Laden Bedroom~
   A newly lain rug of intricately woven material cast upon a 
soft under-layer does little to distract from the various 
scratches, markings and notches taken out of the floor here. 
Tapestries and murals line the walls, garish images of plumpy 
bossomed women and horrifying beasts setting dim the light that 
catches them from the entry-way window and the blackened 
iron-torch holders set into the stout wood columns within. 
Towards the north, a doorway leads to another small room.

A Spartan Work Area and Kitchen~
   This once busy kitchen appears to have been long since 
abandoned, the area in a state of chaotic disarray. Long clothes 
line stretch the walls - a variety of prized pelts of all shapes 
and sizes hanging up them and causing the lines to sag low 
beneath their weight. A few mounted specimens make this small 
space feel even smaller, and obviously the former home of someone 
highly skilled in the art of the hunt.

A Cozy Abode~
   Pluckily designed and sewn curtains drape over two 
haze-glassed windows set into the southern wall upon either side 
of the entryway, threads of light blues and pale greens 
intertwining in a mishmash of color. A homely blue rug hugs 
itself tightly upon the floor beneath, its edges showing the very 
faintest signs of fraying though its surface is impeccably 
spotless. Pleasant aromas seem to be almost embedded into the 
walls without any definite point of origin, discerning mixtures 
of spices and herbs intermingled with hearty wafts of meals long 
since past. Pegs have been tacked into the wall nearest the rock 
and clay fireplace built into the eastern wall, providing ample 
space for cooking utensils and tools. An ornately designed door 
leads northwards, a large flower carved into its center.

An Open Bedroom~
   Engraved candle-holders braced upon the walls on either side 
of the room help to fill it with a resplendent amber light, 
unobscured in the relative openness of this space. Vines and 
herb plants curl out from within ceramic pots set upon small 
shelves set high over the northern wall, their leafy overhangings 
providing a bit of natural atmosphere to the surrounds. Thick 
oak planks make up the floorboards beneath, solid and soundless 
in their support.

A Great Gathering Hall~
   Tall oak columns are spaced evenly about every fifteen feet 
down the length of this great gathering hall, banners embroidered 
with the markings of embattled veterans and memories draped 
inwardly while iron-torch holders are set securely above each, 
lighting the room in a constantly shifting motion of amber and 
shadow. An enduring floor covering of rich greens and reds 
intermingling runs down the center-point of the hall, widening 
out into a full circle surrounding a massive stone fire pit which 
vents upwards into a small open-walled outcropping set high in 
the ceiling above. The floor beneath is constructed of heavy 
wood planks, each seat seamlessly into the next. At the far 
western end of the hall is a second set of double-doors, swords 
crossed beneath round-shields hung upon either side.

the doorstep of a rather small cottage, the home rustic and 
freshly-painted a plain, red color. Though simple in make, the 
cottage is rather sturdy and has been kept clean. To the east, 
the path leads to the gathering of cottages and the brook.

   White stones are stacked in ordered fashion about the length

circular mat of red set before it, the southern-most edges tinted 
in a faint, sooty grey. Wooden pine planks arch overhead, 
forming the frame for a large window looking out onto the plateau 
beyond, thick woolen drapes hung upon a horizontally hung pole 
above. The floorboards are smooth and well-polished, the floor 
in a meticulous state of cleanliness.

divided as an area in the corner has been cleared for cooking, a

rock jutting out from within. The air is stale, unmoving and 
deathly quiet in its thick solitude as it dampens sounds in its 
mass. Thick iron torch-holders go unused, empty and rusting as 
they march down the line of lumber supports in organized fashion 
towards a shoddily constructed doorway to the east.

and chipped rock. The floor below is spattered with blood and 
the viscous remnants of vomit, urine and feces caught together in 
pools besotten by bloated insects and ever-expanding mold and 
grime. Chains line the walls, seeming to serve varying functions 
and purposes, the door westwards providing the only hope of 
escape from this dank pit.

An Ostentatious Gathering Hall~
   Stout oaken beams form cuneate points in the high-ceiling 
above, setting the stage and frame for the grandiose windows 
formed above and to the sides of the entry way to allow in the 
happenings of the world outside. Columns of granite line an 
elongated entry-rug leading within, their positioning seeming 
almost one of opulence rather than form or function as they lead 
inwards towards a gathering area set about a granite fireplace 
made communal by the circular green floor covering beneath. 
Predominant to the room is another large communal area, its 
floored area covered likewise by another thick rug made of 
luscious materials where a table would be set. An intricately 
designed doorway larger than the rest leads further northwards, 
while two comparatively simple doors lead off to either side.

exorbitant tapestry depicting images of several women 
intertwining themselves upon the limbs of a white-haired man 
standing victoriously atop a mountain peak. Elegant gold and 
silver candelbras are tacked on each wall, setting the room 
alight in a luminescent haze carrying with it the sweet scent of 
dried herbs meshed within the wax. The floors are solidly built 
and finely polished, smooth and lain to the point of perfection, 
holding firm against the foundation beneath. A small fireplace 
composed of white marble slabs and fragments is set upon the 
western wall, only the faintest tinges of soot marring its

An Entrance to Musty Catacombs~
   This passage leading into an underground cavern of musty, 
stinking walls is dark and eerie. A staircase of old, rotting 
bones lined with skulls leads down into the floor littered with 
remnants of past life. Various trinkets and ageworn baubles 
glint below the skeleton ridden ground. Even in flickering 
torchlight, the surroundings and tunnels leading from this small 
entrance remain depthless.

A Ledge Above a Brick Lined Pit~
   This ancient room leads around a pit filled with an artistic 
array of skulls and human bones. Old, dusty brick lines the pit, 
keeping its innards safe. The skulls in the man-made circle are 
arranged in a peculiar fashion; a ring of skulls is flanked with 
long, thick bones and repeats the pattern until the very center 
of the pit. A mound of hundreds of heads reaches up, almost to 
the ledge treaded upon. To the west lies a small archway, only 
big enough for one person at a time to squeeze through.

A Sarcophagus-Lined Burial Ground~
   This crevice within the tunnels of the cavern has been put to 
use for a single-family burial tomb. The floor here is cleared 
of bones and skulls and remains immaculate except for the dust of 
years passed lining the cool rock. Several, stone caskets are 
set within dug out portions in the crumbling, stone walls. The 
sarcophaguses seem undisturbed and almost serene despite the 
surroundings.

conditions rise against the walls of this tunnel. The largest of 
the skeleton heads curve with the archways leading to the north 
and east. A stuffy and stale air is lent from the multitude of

Before a Small Chamber~
   Along the two walls of this cave tunnel leading to the north

and family name rest. Lines and rows connect the worn images of 
the relatives together, all leading to a single matriarch who is 
carved above the curved passage to the north.

   Crude carvings of many, many people are etched into the stony 
walls of this tomb. A single, lone funerary box made of gleaming 
wood sits within the rock walls, seeming untouched. Once 
beautiful cloths now yellowed with time drape over the solitary 
casket and on top of them rest utensils and candles of the finest

A Grotto Littered With Wall Carvings~
   Scraped into the walls of this cavity within smooth rock are 
whitened drawings of a large battle. Many bipedal creatures 
raise spears against an army of shorter, stockier creatures. 
Limp bodies are strewn between the opposing forces and on either 
side, behind the throngs, are single, more ornate renderings of 
those depicted. A distinguished man, holding his spear high, 
arcs over the armies below toward a snarling orc with a brutish 
warhammer.

   Two metal caskets sit beside one another on the cleared, but 
dingy floor of this private burial room. On one sarcophagus sits 
a hefty war-axe, rusted with age. On the other rests a 
finely-woven blanket with tassled edges. Lightened spots of 
varying sizes along the cloth that embrace either of these 
caskets suggests other items accompanied the pair in death.

this damp channel remains incredibly dark. Small stands are

   The constant dripping of water can be heard from the jagged 
rock formations withered by the constant flow of liquid down its 
course. A babbling tributary catches some of the droplets and 
carries them away through crevices too small to swim through. 
Lurching stalagmites that catch any light and cast shadows in 
every direction hug the deep water formation on either side. The 
cavern floor here is free of any skeletal debris.

   This simple stall of wooden planks, devoid of decoration or 
comfort serves its function in providing a market shopfront. Two 
poles hold the simple roof aloft, the walls made of sanded planks 
covered in a leather wrapping to provide some protection against 
the elements, as well as airflow and views into the market 
beyond. There is no discernable floorboarding, only the bare and 
dusty road lies underfoot, often soggy and cold. Simple bins and 
shelves have been tacked to the inside walls of the stall, with a 
few strung lanterns providing lighting. A single barrel stool 
sits here for the aged shopkeeper.

Slaughterhouse Behind the Butcher's Shop~
   The room is rather large and quite cold from a line of vents 
high up in the ceiling. The walls are sanded wood that has been 
painted in a stark white color. Many meat hooks hang in one end 
of the slaughterhouse and the floors are tiled with a large drain 
set in the center of the room to drain blood and water. A door 
along the western wall allows employees to #6leave#0 the 
#6slaughterhouse#0 and a trapdoor in the back corner of the room 
allows employees to #6enter#0 the #6storeroom#0.

   A worn oval marks the indoor riding ring within this roofed 
arena, packed earth stomped by the innumerable passes of equine 
feet. Soldiers drill military maneuvers on horseback, training 
both themselves and their steeds to move forward and back, pivot 
and wheel in the delicate dance of combat footwork. Others 
charge the quintain, learning to strike at speed and to remove 
the horses fear. Simple walls and a peaked roof all made of hewn 
planking protect from the elements year round, but do not 
completely stop the filtering light and drafty breezes from 
dancing in the hoof-stirred dust.

A Sharp-Smelling Workshop~
   Nestled in the corner between the tower and barn, this wooden 
outbuilding provides a dry, warm workshop for its artisan's use. 
Precisely-fitted pinewood boards make the walls, roof, and floor, 
though a stained and acid-marked braid rug softens footfalls in 
the room's center. A wooden shuttered window in the south wall 
can be opened to let in fresh air, slides and props crafted 
artfully to allow it to be fixed open at four different 
positions. Shelves with dozens of compartments have been 
ingeniously crafted into the corners, maximizing the small room's 
capacity. Even when the windows open, the strange, astringent 
smells of the room cannot be completely dispersed.

horses, wagons, and people on foot clog up the make-shift trail 
near the forest, many within the group working diligently to 
cautiously avoid closing the distance between them and the
