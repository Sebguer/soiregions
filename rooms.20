River Anduin Near the Western Shore~
   This near the shore, the Anduin's waters are more or less 
still, compared to the rest of the great river. Reeds grow up 
through the water along the western side, near to the bank, which 
is not far away. The flow of the the river is southerly, and in 
the distance it bends slightly around to the west. To the 
northwest the walls of Osgiliath can be seen. Due north the 
city's great bridge spans the immense river. To the east, there 
is nothing but water.

River Anduin Under the Western Walls of Osgiliath~
   This near the shore, the Anduin's waters are more or less 
still, compared to the rest of the great river. Reeds grow up

slimey walls of Osgiliath that reach the bank. The flow of the 
the river is southerly, and in the distance it bends slightly 
around to the west. To the west the walls of Osgiliath can be 
seen, rising up along the bank. Just to the north the city's 
great bridge spans the immense river. To the east, there is

River Anduin Under the Western Walls of Osgiliath~
   Immediately to the west the walls of Osgiliath rise up on the 
banks of the Anduin, and the waters flow relatively swiftly past. 
High overhead the great bridge of Osgiliath spans the river, 
overshadowing it. The water is very cold, and a dark blue in 
colour, and quite deep. Moss and lichen cling to the walls of 
Osgiliath, along with slime and algae.

   Here the flow of the Anduin is very great, making swimming 
here treacherous. All around there is little to see but water. 
Very far in the distance to the west is the shore, and north the 
great bridge of Osgiliath spans the river, overshadowing it. The 
water is very cold and a dark blue-green in colour. 
The river grows far more treacherous further east, its current
much too strong for anyone to swim further across.

Floating among the stars beyond a backdrop of starlight~
   Every so often a piece of cosmic debris drifts past your head 
or arm, moving on its wayward path towards oblivion. Far off on 
the horizon is an ever full sun that glows bright through the 
pinprick light from each of the many stars. Countless in number, 
these dots hang from the sky by an infinite number of invisible 
strings. It is temperate if slightly cool, the cold of space 
balanced by the great heat from the pulsing orb of the far off 
sun.

A Wooded Area just beyond a Cave Mouth~
   Nestled in the curvature of the precarious mountain walls, 
this small section of wood hosts a struggling sense of abandoned 
gloom. Dark trees devoid of foliage loom menacingly, their naked 
and twisted branches reaching in anguish to the sky. The ground 
underfoot is covered in a dense layer of organic rot, the leaves 
and twigs decayed into a thick and pungent slime. Here and there 
lie the old and rotted ends of long-fallen trees, their bark 
almost completely overrun by thick moss and sickly yellow fungi.

A Narrow Stretch of Woods up the Hills~
   Silence reigns eerily over this section of wood, bordered to 
the north by a stony embrace. Devoid even of the natural sounds 
of wildlife and sheltered from the winds, the twisted black trees 
cling to the slippery bed of decay that coats the ground. The 
curving trunks rise to angular branches and sharp twigs; crooked 
forms lacking the softness foliage lends. The ground angles from 
east to west, leading up toward a stony wall.

The Termination of Woods at a Rock Face~
   At a sharp angle, the rock walls join here, the ground rising 
the nearer to the stone it gets. Passage to the south is 
rendered nearly impossible due to the sheer slope of the rising 
cliff-face, though a very steep and narrow natural path heads up 
along the western wall and into the mountain. Below that is the 
mouth of a swiftly descending cave cloaked in darkness. 
   Here the trees thin even further and those that do grow appear 
even more sickly and twisted than the rest. Mounds of rock and 
dirt undulate out of the ground-covering rot; small bastions of 
respite from the slippery slime.

Foggy Woods reaching an Overlook~
   Rising to a quick dropoff, the trees give way to the 
precipice-like overlook, hanging over the marsh presumably below 
but impossible to discern through the heavy yellow haze that just 
barely touches the base of this higher ground. To the west, the 
clear bluff meets sheer cliff-face prevening further travel in 
that direction. Underfoot, no grass grows, instead, the thick 
brown slime of decaying leaves makes for precarious footing.

A Rise in Foggy Woods~
   Upon the rise of the ground, a fog remains about knee-height 
on a normal human, thick and soupy of yellowish hue. The snaking 
tendrils wind around the dark and dying trees to hide the coiling 
knotty roots from view and coating the slimy organic decay of the 
ground with moisture. From somewhere to the north, the sound of 
blurping water indicates a rapid descent into the damp.

The Foggy Joining of Woods and Marsh~
   Angling down from the eastern wall, the ground declines, 
approaching what appears to be a stagnant marsh. A heavy haze of 
yellowish fog carries a foul odor; a mineral stink that only 
seems to amplify the reek of rot from the damp and decaying 
leaves rotting underfoot. The trees break near the thick reeds 
which punctuate the fog, indicating the marsh's edge. To the 
west, the ground appears to rise again.

Where the Swampy Marsh Meets a Wood~
   The sweaty rank odor of the marsh, aided by its moist 
companion, the fog, assails the senses like a wall. The thick 
yellow-tinted fog hangs humidly over the stagnant muddy waters, 
obscuring the reeds and any ability to gauge the depth of the 
mire. Beneath the waters, gooey mud gives way underfoot, 
creating a hazard both slippery and still clinging like glue to 
any invader.

In a Foggy Marsh Near Rising Ground~
   Rising like the keel of some vast ship, the solid ground rises 
from the murky depths to the south. Spiking out from the muddy 
wall, blackened twisting roots jab out to trip, gouge, or spear 
anyone foolish enough to seek the wall as a support or guide. 
Mud sucks and slurps at invading footwear, eager to ensnare 
foreign objects to that soggy realm. Periodically, some unseen 
entity surges in the cloudy waters, creating ripples that blub 
sickeningly against anything in their undulating paths.

Where Land Cuts Off the Marsh~
   Perhaps due to the marsh water eating away at it, the wall of 
earth has decayed into a wide, curving overhang, terminating this 
section of the marsh. Along the water's edge, through the rank 
fog, stone appears, denuded from its protective covering of mud. 
The soupy water remains thick and stagnant. Too heavy with silt 
and mud to effectively slap against the stone, the rare and 
sluggish ripples in the liquid cling to the rock, leaving the 
surface riddled with dirt along the water's edge.

A Plateau Overlooking An Ancient Swampland~
   This flat stretch of rock overlooks an ancient, reeking 
swampland to the east, the entire area covered in a yellowish fog 
no matter the time of day nor season. A steeply-sloping and 
treacherous-looking path leads down toward that area. To the 
west are the mountains and northern Ithilien beyond.
