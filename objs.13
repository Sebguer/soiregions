Isildur Elendil Anarion statues great ancient three STONE PELARGIR UNIQUE~
three ancient statues~
Three great statues from ancient days are set here, towering above the market.~
   Carved from great amounts of white stone, these statues are 
over thrice the height of the tallest nobleman. There are three 
men carved, one taller than the other two. The faces of all 
three men are stern, with sharp features and shoulder length 
hair. Upon their brows rest crowns, the tallest man wearing the 
most jeweled and carefully engraved, and upon their broad 
shoulders rest great suits of armour. Rippling muscles are 
visible on all the men, and each has their hand upon the hilt of 
a longsword. They stand, each looking out to one of the three 
great towers of the city, the tallest looking to the northern, 
while the two younger, shorter numenoreans look south west and 
south east.
   Though they have been carved with great love and great skill,
time has taken its toll upon the three statues. In places, the 
intricate features have been weathered away, and in others the
white stone has turned green, with vines running up the legs 
of the men.

   This youthful gondorian has suffered a severe mauling at the 
hands of some dark enemy, possible in one of the violent 
skirmishes on the eastern border. Donning simple ringmail armor, 
he has a wide, bleeding slice on his right thigh and a 
darkly-fletched arrow buried through his thorax, which has 
perforated his mail, flesh, ribs and back armor. His breath 
comes in a ragged, pained way, and his eyes are glassy. Death

spear GOOD_QUALITY oak shafter iron headed one hand  METAL~
an oak-shafted, one-handed spear with an iron head~
An oak-shafted spear has been left here, its iron head glinting dully.~
   Crafted with evident attention, this solid spear can be 
wielded in one hand with ease, the length of the shaft being 
thinner and lighter than what an usual, two handed weapon would 
have been. The spearhead has been crafted from iron and affixed 
firmly to the wood with bronze rivets, keeping a sharp, honed 
edge. The weight and balance of this spear would allow someone 
strong enough to use it as a throwing weapon, making the weapon 
quite versatile in the hand of a skilled user.
