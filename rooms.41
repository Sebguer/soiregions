A Vast Room Positioned At A Large Gate~
   This chamber is immensive in size. Its ceiling resides in the 
darkness, only revealed by the light of a great flame should such 
be present. The distance between the craggy walls is a great 
range. The floor is perfectly smoothed and masterfully leveled, 
but is in a state of chaos. Rock-strewn and debris-filled, this 
room's once perfect crafting is lost to the mess and clutter of 
rubble. 
   Within the chamber's center is a great brazier fashioned of 
thick iron. Despite being heavily rusted, it remains very 
sturdy, resiliently withstanding the hands of time.

brazier~
   Fashioned from heavy pieces of iron, the brazier is now caked 
in rust. Time has not been gently upon the brazier; it shows many 
signs of violence upon it and rusted dominates the object. However, 
due to great fashioning and heavy material, the brazier seems to 
remain functional as it is intact despite damages.

At A Junction~
   Formed by the merging of three thing passages, this junction 
is a moderately sized hollow that resides in the darkness of the 
earth. The stone that forms the ceiling of this chamber is 
jagged and the wall to the north is craggy. Moving in three 
directions is a rugged path.

In A Tunnel of Light-Grey Stone~
   Moving through the solid stone of light-grey tint, this path 
moves along its rugged and asperous course from east to west. 
The ceiling that hangs above this tunnel is a low-hanging roof of 
stone and upon either side of this trail stand two walls of 
unyielding stone.

A Junction of Three Paths~
   As the three pathways merge into one, they form a slightly 
larger chamber that is increased in size because of their 
converging. This hollowed place is an asperous area that was 
crudely excavated from to form a junction of the three tunnels.

East of an Intersection~
   Positioned to the east of a confined intersection, this slim 
and diminuitive tunnel has been formed into a rugged and craggy 
pathway that moves west and east. Following a linear course, the 
trail is a difficult travel due to the frequency of damage upon 
its stone surface.

lies deep beneath the earth's surface. The walls of this pathway 
are cool to the touch and possess an uneven surface that bears 
many mars and gouges. However, this rough-hewn tunnel does

Approaching the Lake's Center~
   Drawing near to the center of the underground lake, this area 
of water seems to be very deep. If this cavern were alit, the 
walls bordering the lake would be viewable only by those 
possessing far-sight, and the ceiling seems distant and far as it 
looms high above the crystal surface of this blue lake.

At the Center of a Lake~
   Located at the center of this vast cavern, this area is the 
center of the vast lake of crystal-blue. The water here is quite 
chill to the touch, but appears to be of a drinkable nature. It 
is impossible to see the walls that border this lake and no exit 
might be perceived from this point.

Nearing the Center of the Lake~
   This section of water lies atop the crystal blue lake as it 
draws near to the focus of the lake. The water is very cool at 
this point, and it is quite evident the lake dives to lengthy 
depths beneeath this point. It is difficult to see the walls and 
ceililng from this location as well because it such a sizable 
distance from the edge of the cavern lake.

At Water's Edge~
   Functioning as the western border to the serene lake, this 
wall of solid stone looms high above the surface of the lake of 
crystal blue that resides motionlessly in the natural basin of 
bedrock. Here, the water is almost lumniscent, sparkling lightly 
in the faintest presence of light.

Within the Tranquil Water~
   Placed to the south of the lake's center point, this area of 
water lies just south of the region that makes the focal point of 
the water-filled basin. Here, nigh to the deepest point of the 
extensive lake, the water is quite cold.

The Meeting of Water and Floor~
   Lying to the north of the immense body of water's innermost 
point, this stretch of water is positioned in close proximity to 
the basin's deepest point. Thus, the water of this area is very 
cold, easily able to sap the warmth from a living person's body.

The Bottom of an Underground Lake~
   Lying at the bottom of an underground lake, this bowl-shaped 
area of water is the deepest and centermost point of the 
expansive lake that lies locked within the stone chamber. 
   The water possesses a blue equivalent to that of a clear 
crystal when light is present, but seldom is such the case.

Approaching a Downward Ramp~
   This area of wide tunnel serves as the top landing for a ramp 
that digs deeper into the dark stone that surrounds this tunnel. 
Uncharacteristic of neighboring portions of the tunnel, the 
floor, walls, and ceiling have been formed in clean, smooth 
surfaces, and being of wide girth, this area of tunnel could 
easily handle a large flow of traffic.

   Serving as a landing base for the smooth and well-constructed 
ramp, this area of tunnel possesses the smooth floor and walls as 
the ramp does before slowly merging with the less carefully 
fashioned portions of tunnel that run on past the ramp. It 
possesses the common glimmer seen throughout much of the tunnel.

glimmer~
    As this tunnel continues its journey with the tapped vein, 
it seemingly grows less speckled than sections of tunnel which 
came before.  Although similar in size, the speckles are less
frequent and do not possess the same reflective powers as those 
further west and up in the adit.

Passing Through a Dark Tunnel~
   Offer a span of six abreast, this tunnel gives an ample space 
for travel along its rough course. Here, the tunnel walls have 
been jagged cut, many tiny crevices or mars moving up and down 
its uneven surface. The floor matches the appearance of the 
walls with its many potholes and bumps that cover it.

Its wall are of a dark stone, grey in hue, and they are smooth to 
the touch and cool when in contact with skin. There are many 
crumbled bits of rock that lay strewn about the edges of the wide 
tunnel to indicate the collapse or destruction of stalagmytes.

craggy, this section of tunnel is surrounded by asperous walls of 
a rugged and jagged sort. Many large snags or rents cover the 
floor, mirroring the features of the walls.                                                                                                                           Here, there is a great pile of cut stone blocks, looked to have been dug from the

into the rockbed. Here, the stone is quite smooth, offered an 
even surface as the dark-grey walled passageway proceeds along

rock that forms the walls is of a shadowy-grey coloration. The 
path is somewhat rough, but provides a usable walkway despite the 
presence of the occasional pothole.

within the darkness of the earth. It is formed of craggy walls 
and possesses an uneven, pothole-marred floor which shares its 
nature-given characteristics with the ceiling above. This tunnel 
is rather spacious and could allow for the passage of five

through nature's gentle touch. bearing many stalagmites, the 
bumpy floor nearly mirrors the stalactite-covered ceiling. 
   The center of this large room seems to bear a feature that is

rushing water grows closer and the air feels at once warmer and
stifling. In contrast the narrowing western way brings a cool
stillness and the uniformity of crafted ashen stone unmarred by
time and nature.

Naught but tiny patches of exposed rock allow respite from the

At the End of a Dark Tunnel~
   The floor of the tunnel drops steeply from the north, the 
ceiling rising now high above. The air reeks of decay and rot, 
its heat and humidity weighing heavily on any who dare pass. The 
walls and floor are carpeted by a thick layer of slimey mold, 
making the area dangerous to traverse.

A Dark, Hot, Moldy Enclave~
   This enclave leads off in a short tunnel to the east, and 
rises at a sharp incline to the north, winding off upwards. Mold 
grows along the walls, ceiling and floor of this small cave, and 
the air is humid and hot. Shallow pools of water makes the 
ground treacherous to walk along.

Nearing a Cavern Beneath the Mines~
   This short tunnel gusts with warm, humid air from the east, 
where it opens up into a spacious cavern in the distance. Its 
stone walls are rough and uneven and further to the east even 
bears signs of char, as if the stone was burnt some time ago, and 
wooden pillars that - albeit uselessly - stand to support the 
high ceiling are rotted and splintery.

In a Tunnel Lined with Thick Vegetation~
   Thick swampwater stands shallow in this tunnel, only a minor
annoyance. The greater obstruction is the multitude of plants
that hang from the ceiling and walls, long enough to drape down
to obscure vision and passage. The hot, stinking mist settled in
this narrow place does not help. Larger plants than elsewhere
in the swamp can be found here, of many varieties - bulbous ones,
spotted ones, ones with tendrils, ones with teeth.

A Sagging Tunnel in Reclaimation~
   One side of this tunnel, the rock overhead sagging and pushing
down, is in the process of being reclaimed by the mountain. Many
of the supports here have failed and lie in cracked heaps on the
bare rock underfoot, joining the rubble. Only a narrow passage
remains, though this tunnel terminates to the east and opens there
into a wider cavern.

tunnel into the entrance of this large cavern. The smell here is
cleaner but with a new hint of musk. Noticeably absent underfoot
is the slickness of swampwater, replaced instead by a carpet of
vibrant, sea-green moss and small, healthy plants, many of which
have been chewed or trampled. The walls here are covered with moss
also, leaving only the ceiling marked with bare stone.

A squirming albino worm
Stretching several feet long this white invertebrate does not appear to have a head. It is a few inches thick and covered in thick slime. Ridges line its exterior. The strength of the creature is disconcerting as it is able to wiggle out of the strongest grip. It naturally seeks to submerge itself in any nearby soft earth.
A dung beetle
A squat body, iridescent green, taps continuously on the ground. This beetle has disproportionately short legs capped with gripping pincers. Its mandibles are gigantic looking to be multi pronged and quite strong.
A dried cocoon
Approximately the size of a thumb this cocoon is dried and forgotten by its original inhabitant. Silken threads hold on to debris that at one time lent it purchase to what ever substance its creator attached it to. It is hollow and gray, open at one end and looks to be quite old.
An old rat's nest
Long having been abandoned this small pile of debris looks to have been crudely woven, its substance being further held together by dried dung. Bits of trash, roots and straw, combined with less savory elements comprise its bulk. White bones, yellowed at the ends, are also evident.
A shiny black beetle
A nondescript example of a beetle, this insect is black with six segmented legs, two small antennae, and a three sectioned body. It is not overly large or fast. It is covered in a shiny black shell and it emits a low clicking when it moves.
A giant slime worm
Grasping proboscis stretch into the air and look like writhing white crown on the head of this slime covered worm. It is a half an inch thick and several inches long though it appears to be able to compact its body greatly when in defensive mode while extending to great lengths when trying to move. It seems to have a limitless ability to produce a snot like ooze from every square inch of its body.

underground source, there is a current making the water restless

  Wide and skillfully set, a stone arc dominates the east wall 
and is as broad as the thin and slippery ledge. Two sturdy and 
short pillars of stone that rises from the floor is set on the 
edge of the ledge, below the deep and repulsive hole that leads 
down to dark and slimy water. The air is filled with a stench 
reminding of rotten flesh and decay, and the moist air leaves all 
stone cold and wet. Drops of water accumulate in the roof, and 
falls the long way into the waters below.

arc~
This wide stone arc spans most of the width of the hole, and have scrapes and cuts on its sides and the floor below it. Made from a similar stone as the natural walls themselves, it is skillful work in stone with smooth lines and barely hairline cracks between the individual stones. Some decorations are set in the top of the arc, crossed pick-axes and some decorative patterns.

Collapsed Passage~
   This rather large passage through the mountain has clearly 
been a natural cave, which have been expanded by tools and hands. 
It is shaped like a semi-circle with a narrow section near the 
bend and dark stone from the size of pebbles to boulders have 
rolled out and lies strewn across the uneven floor. Near the 
roof at the side that collapsed are cracks and fractures, and 
hints to other shafts or crosscuts that have been buried beneath 
tons of dark-grey stone. Moss and thick layers of dust rests on 
the fallen stones reassuring in that the collapse of the roof 
occurred long ago.

stone breaks up from the cold waters of the mist-covered 
underground lake. Sounding like thunder in the distant east, a 
waterfall must fall from a great height to bring water to this 
enormous cave beneath the roots of the mountains. Here the mist 
grows thin and the magnificence of the mountain wall rising 
upwards to the west can be glimpsed in the distance. Some 
circulation of the air exists - moving about the mist, and there 
are smaller waves and irregularities to the cold water. Such 
movements of the lake have left a sparse collection of bones and 
debris on the uneven and slimy rock shore.

   A cauldron of churning water where the waterfall after having 
fallen from the roof of the cave strikes the surface of a 
underground lake and throws up water meters into the air as the 
two collide with a thunderous roar. Striking the water is also 
other debris, carried along by the powerful stream - sometimes

depth. A thick and frigid mist blanket the surrounding lake, and 
the water is deep and cold.

dripping from the ceiling.

A Warm, Burnt Column Below The Mines~
   This short tunnel gusts with warm, humid air from the east, 
where it opens up into a spacious cavern. Its stone walls are 
blackened, as if the stone was burnt some time ago, and wooden 
pillars that - albeit uselessly - stand to support the high 
ceiling are charred and splintery.

Jagged Shore West Of A Misty Lake~
   In the far distance one can hear a mighty waterfall roar 
through the mist, its cold and damp embrace covering the dark 
stone shore here where it rises out of the waters as a serrated 
blade. The mist thins however as one leaves the lake, and the 
majesty of the cave and its right proportions becomes apparent as 
one seems the west wall rising up taller then any building ever 
dreamt of by man. A small pool or basin have been formed nearby 
in a bed-rock hollow that gathered water from the sea.

Out On Misty Waters~
   Far out on the cold and deep lake, the cold moisture from the 
waterfall to the east still obscures sight and brings with it a 
frozen wetness to the very air. There is a smell of decaying 
plants in the air, and there are odd swirls and motions in the 
water as from currents on unseen reefs. Occasionally one can 
glimpse a stalactite from the roof, hanging down like a giant's 
spear that pierces the mist. 
   To the north and west, through the pitch of darkness, the 
grainy shore can be seen.

A Misty Shore Near Altar~
   Here the dark-grey rock of the cave descends gently into the 
ice-cold waters, and the mist seems thinner then further north 
where the sight is obscured into nothingness by a white wall. 
Thunderous and ever-present a waterfall southwards drenches all 
lesser sounds, yet afar and carrying such sound it must be of 
enormous proportions. Near the water lies a huge stone slab, 
crudely shaped by nature or an unknown sculptor to reassemble an 
altar - ten or fifteen steps across in all directions and five 
man-sized steps high.

North-west Wall At Dwelling~
   Near a bend in the gigantic stone wall that rises upwards in 
the north and west, this part of the enormous cave holding the 
misty lake have long been untouched by the water. Far south-east 
one can see the shores of the lake through the thin cold fog and 
even here the lake makes itself reminded with the damp frigid air 
and the odd smell of rotting vegetation that lies on the air. At 
a place where several boulders lies to form a careless stack of 
rock is sign of habitation, some scrawling have been made on the 
stone and swarthy patches mark where fires once burnt.

Inside A Group Of Boulders~
   Inside the gathering of boulders are no ample shelter, large 
holes and whole parts of the roof is lacking for one to call it a 
room - yet there are quite a few places where one can find a 
small crevice of three walls and something similar to a ceiling. 
More of the scratches on the stone can be found on the inside, 
like someone have marked of something in a great count that 
didn't fit on the walls within the great stone shack. Strewn and 
gathered in corners there are scraps of rotting cloth, a some 
pieces of rusty metal and two decomposing fishing rods lies 
broken on a heap of old fish-bones. Half of what might be a 
human skull lies against a wall where the stone carry a slight 
brownish hue. 
   In the center of the makeshift fortress is a ramp that leads 
down into steamy mist, the stone path littered with odd greenery.

North Of A Misty Lake~
   With the mist growing lighter here where the water of the 
enormous is broken off by sharp dark cliffs, it is possible to 
see more of the gargantuan cave with stalactites and stalagmites 
ten or twenty times the length of a man. The cave wall is a 
whole horizon to the north-east and the roof is lost in white 
mist. Every surface is slick and wet from the moist fog, and the 
sharpness of the cliffs and the smaller stalagmites makes 
careless travel hazardous.

rough-hewn walls, the tunnel appears to be tapering outward as it 
moves on its easterly course.

A Crevice Overlooking A Wide Tunnel~
   Nestled snuggly into the wall, this small burrow seems capable 
of holding only a few patrons. It has been carved from the wall 
in an oval fashion and provides a simple and bare floor with 
smoothed, rounded walls bordering. The opening to the west 
allows for one to peer over the edge and see the distant pathway 
below. 
   An old rope ladder sits positioned at the edge of the crevice, 
securely fastened about a pair of spikes holding it to the 
flooring.

The Curved Landing of a Ramp~
   The ramp's decline is smooth and of the same well-made stone
as the walls of this tunnel, but the landing marks an abrupt
change. The landing's crafted stone is sharply overtaken by a
spotty carpet of dirt and moss blanketing rougher rock split
by cracks housing small, leafy plants. The air here is not the
stale, close stillness of a bare tunnel but is ripe with the
scent of earth, growth and decay. The rushing sound of water's
muffled movement can be heard echoing in the distance of this
lower hall.

A Cavern Mined in Haste~
   This cavern, finished and without need of support, was formed
nonetheless by crude, hacking strokes of the pickaxe rent in haste,
continuing the western tunnel's quality of workmanship. The rock
here is barely shaped and could still be called raw. A layer of
dust and dirt suggests this place has gone untouched for years.
Large webs are strewn here, stretching between stalactite and
stalagmite, between the walls and ceiling.

   This cavern has been carved from the rock by crude mining done
with little direction or pattern. The walls and floor are irregular
and inconsistent - here sharp and rough, there smoothed, as if
worked by seperate crews not in communication. The dark rock is
bare and dry, untouched by the moisture, fog or stench of the
nearby swamp. Large webs are all that mark the rock, though they

A Tight Tunnel through Rubble~
   This tunnel is cramped, with much of its passage being taken
up by rubble and the pillars of rough stone hastily erected as
supports for the crumbling ceiling hacked into the rock overhead.
The supports seem aged, one of the few pieces of stonework in this
mountain to fare poorly with time. The uncommonly shoddy workmanship
suggests they were constructed in haste.

to be covered in a layer of greenish slime; it coats the stones,

Above An Underground Waterfall~

opposite side is a sheer drop-off, overlooking a fast-flowing 
river shooting out of the cliff face. The thunderous sound of a 
large amount of water falling a great distance echoes off the 
nearby walls. Moisture glistens on the stones, making their 
surfaces slick and slippery. A constant mist hangs in the air, 
created from the outer edge of the waterfall's spray. Far below,

crashing against a number of rocky outcroppings as it goes.

waters is quite narrow, but appears solid. No cracks are visible 
in the dark grey stone, though it is rough and jagged in places.

Within A Narrow Passageway~
   Positioned along an east to west line, this narrow tunnel 
moves through the outreaching snags of the stone walls. This 
portion of passageway moves along its journey in an uncertain and 
unlevel fashion across a rough, nonplanar floor.

At A Busy Intersection~
   Abruptly shifting direction, this tunnel, characteristically 
crooked and bent, shifts its direction from the west to either 
north or south. The path is housed by a confined set of stone 
walls and loomed over by a slab of solid rock. The floor of this 
somewhat arched path is unlevel and hardly a path that is 
favorable to travel.

A Crook In A Confined Path~
   Closed in by solid stone walls that arc together just above

Passing Along A Narrow Stair~
   Moving along its course, this path suddenly dives into the 
earth at a sudden rate. The trail this path follows is uncertain 
and oft the rugged cut stairwell will twist its direction 
slightly. Along the walls that border this path are many rents 
and gashes. The faces of the constricting walls are heavily 
blemished by these mars.

   At this point, three tunnels converge into a single chamber. 
Offering a room slightly more affording than surrounding tunnel, 
this space will allow for the loiter of several individuals.

sentient beings.

A Deep Cranny in the Massive Cavern~
   Made to be a rotund room that moves deep into the stone, this 
area is a sizeable space that is dwarfed in proportions by the 
mammoth cavern from which it is birthed. The area here would be 
well-suited to holding a great quantity of things and is created

A Slanted Tunnel~
   This wide tunnel has a slanted floor, heading down as it goes 
east, and up as it curves southward. The loose gravel covering 
the ground makes movement a little tricky, the small, rough 
pieces of rock a darker grey than the surrounding walls. 
Although the ceiling and sides of the passage are relatively 
flat, there are occasional paler sections which stick out 
slightly here and there.

   This tunnel narrows until it ends in what is little more than 
a thin, jagged crevice. To the west, the passage slants upward, 
becoming wider as it goes. The floor here is covered in a thick 
layer of dark gravel and small pieces of loose rock; much of it 
looks out of place, given the paleness of the surrounding stones. 
The ceiling and sides of the passage are a somewhat lighter gray, 
with numerous rough patches which stick out slightly from the

Mining Tunnel Ending In A Stone Arch~
   Running in a semi straight line from north to south this 
stretch of tunnel appears to be an opportunistic exploitation of 
a more naturally occurring fissure in the earth. Though dulled 
by time evidence of expeditious chisel and hammer strikes cover 
every visible surface. Spanned a man's height apart wooden cross 
beams appear to have been erected to re-enforce the ceiling. 
Remnants of these stanchions can still be felt inside the roughly 
hewed holes they were driven into. Any support they might have 
given has long since ceased. Whether or not the need for their 
support still exists remains to be seen. The floor here is flat, 
rough cut and downward sloped leading further into the cave. A 
single groove looks worn down into the center of the rock and 
runs the length of the tunnel. In the south end is set an old 
stone arch.

Mined Cavern Displying Exposed Ore Veins~
   The darkness grows deeper leading further into the cave. The 
same evidence of rudimentary excavation can be detected on the 
walls ceiling and floor. The slope of the cavern seems to mirror 
a few off color lines on the west hand wall. As a black seem in 
the western wall slopes downward so to does the tunnel. Farther 
away from the sky the air here takes on a fouled smell. Light 
echoes of falling pebbles as well as the barely discernible sound 
of water dripping can be heard by those who take the time to 
focus their senses. Though the cut running down the center of 
the tunnel continues through this area hand sized rocks litter 
the floor with more regularity and more than a few are wedged 
into the groove. Unsettling, the ceiling here appears to bow in 
the middle.

Foul-smelling Passage~
   Growing stronger, the smell of decay here underscores the 
claustrophobic atmosphere of this stretch of tunnel. Any wooden 
supports have long ago rotted down to naught more than greasy 
stains. Lichens and mosses grow in the hastily cut support holes 
at the ceiling. Detritus is more populous underfoot. Shallow 
cuts in either wall are small, looking to have been cut by blunt 
tipped shovel. If this is evidence of the strength of the cave 
walls one could easily see the need for the now vacant support 
beams. Slack, the thumb sized chunks of coal, crush underfoot 
long since having been rendered valueless by water and exposure. 
A series of cracks and faults mar the ceiling and the floor.

At A Short Mine-shaft~
   The walls open up a bit on either side accommodating a wood 
re-enforced shaft sunk into the center of the man made cavern. 
Smoke from torches slowly works its way back toward the surface 
on the sloped surface of the ceiling. Ventilation is slow and 
the air quickly fouled even by the least time spent here. How 
workers could have mined for any length of time is difficult to 
imagine. The dark flat-lying stratum that the previous shaft 
followed continues on north south but remains thin not providing 
any chalk worth extracting and seemingly abandoned for this 
reason. The collar of the downward leading shaft is spongiform 
does not appear to be able to support any weight. The floor of 
the shaft appears to be no further away than the height of a man.

A Mined Low-roofed Cavern~
   Water can be easily heard and smelled here. The air is tinged 
with a sulphuric taint. Staining on the walls and floor evidence 
metallic deposits long since extracted. The same efficient 
though unaesthetic hand that carved the previous sections of 
tunnel have created this one. The floor remains sloped, footing 
through not difficult does require a conscious effort to 
maintain. The ceiling creeps lower and in sections requires 
persons of standard height to duck. These natural ribs, spanning 
the width of the cavern, lend just enough support to maintain the 
cavern.

Shore Of Waterfilled Caverns~
   Oily black murky water laps quietly halfway into this area. 
The liquid appears to have undone what was left of the natural 
support maintaining the tunnel's structural integrity. Large 
sections of rock have broken from the ceiling and litter the 
floor. Fissures appear in both sides of the walls. Dirt and 
dusk hang chokingly in the air. Any light source carried this 
far burns low and bluish in the pollution. Occasionally there is 
issued a low grumble from the depths of the earth causing dust to 
fall from the ceiling and ripples to dapple the surface of the 
water. Far out into the chill of the water the floor appears to 
fall away revealing further depths where tiny bubbles 
occasionally break the surface.

A Circular Cavern Submerged In Oily Water~
   Blackness and chill surround absolutely. Muscles seize in the 
water's bone chilling numb. Minuscule bubbles, yellow in color, 
rise up from cracks in the floor. Without exception they follow 
the contour of the ceiling and travel toward the south. The 
water is oily and thick reducing visibility to only a few hands 
breadths. Slime has grown up to cover every surface, floor 
ceiling and walls, in a primordial looking ooze. It has rendered 
soft any sharp edges. Circular, the cavern travels further 
northwards into even blacker, deeper depths.

   Any sound here is amplified by the water. Sharp reports like 
ancient bones breaking echo here from time to time. These sounds 
assault the ears and boarder on physically painful. Rocks 
dislodged roll slowly down the floor cutting courses through 
thick slimy residue that coats everything. The rounded slime 
authored shaping of the caverns is still everywhere as it 
maintains its roughly north south direction. The steep angle of 
the floor and ceiling continues unabated.

Along Passage Through Ice-cold water~
   The height of the tunnel lessens dramatically here. It is as 
if a giant heavy hand has pressed the floor and ceiling closer 
together. Bowed out on either side, the walls have been forced 
apart. If one were walking they would be forced to crawl here. 
One swimming merely makes the occasional unpleasant contact with 
the rust colored crud that coats everything. If imaginable, the 
water grows even colder. The far away walls offer good hiding 
places for whatever small darting things inhabit just outside of 
one's awareness. Small bubbles again form, leaking from the 
floor and lower walls, and travel southward, up the incline, 
toward the entrance of this deep tunnel.

Submerged Drift~
   Travelling blindly through the tunnel from south to north one 
could easily bump into the floor as this area finally offers some 
respitefrom the steady downward angel leading one from the 
surface to this place. The floor is an accumulation of gravity's 
captives over the many years this place has existed. Large 
chunks of rock half bury rusted blunt shovels, pick axe heads and 
other primitive mining tools. Any attempt to extract or even 
touch them renders them into floating dust that settles into the 
cracks and fissures of the ages of detritus here. Interspersed 
within the trash of time are bones, some rust red like the algae 
that covers everything, some white and newer. The cavern seems 
slightly more intact to casual inspection. The water is still 
cold and the floating obstacles and annoyances are abundant. 
This place has a cold and dark almost unimaginable to anyone who 
has even a memory of light. Bubbles here travel both north and 
south along the ceiling.

southern. Moving up from the bottom the water begins to take on 
a less polluted feel. Though still black and cold the ichor like 
slime abates somewhat. The tunnel appears more square. Roughly 
the height and width of a humans height not more than an inch of 
rust red ichor hugs the walls.

At Pool Of Water~
   Dripping down the walls from the ceiling water collects in a 
pool to the southern end of the tunnel. Slick with moister the 
walls here are again rough hewn. The hands that carved them 
laboriously chipping out section after section of rock. 
Individual chip marks show in the walls. Grooves and hammer 
strikes appear to have been chipped and cut by muscle power 
alone. A groove, one hand span thick and of the same depth, runs 
down the center of the cavern. It disappears into the murky 
water at the southern end of the room and onward into the next 
northern area. There is a darker section of earth on the western 
wall a few hand spans wide that begins innocuously and widens as 
it winds to the north. Sound here does not travel far before 
being muffled. The air while breathable is stale, old tasting, 
with a metallic tinge on the tongue.

growing further apart as one moves from south to north. The same 
groove cuts down the center of the room. The floor on either 
side of it appears cut more for function than form. It is pitted 
and uneven, apparently the product of that which was extracted 
from this area. This section of tunnel owes its structural 
integrity to the solid stone that predominates it. Whatever 
earth shift flooded and buried the higher more southerly sections 
seem to have to yet seriously stress this area.

A Cranny South Of A Narrow Path~
   Carved into the wall to be a small hollow, this area is not 
affording in space. The walls that form the borders of here are 
asperous in nature and composed of grey-colored stone. The floor 
of this place is smooth and unusually flat.

Along the Twisted Trail of Stairs~
   Walled by stone of a soft-grey, this pathway is a rugged way 
that is domed by an archway and is fenced in by aforementioned 
stone. The stairwell that provides the floor of this pathway is 
a rough path. It has been hewn into the stone and formed by an 
undelicate means of force.

A Staircase Moving Along A Confined Tunnel~

passageway provided by the encompassing stone. Forming asperous 
borders, the walls that surround this path allow for only a small 
width of a path to give to any whom might travel this 
stone-locked stair.

Around a Fire-pit in the Center of the Cave~
   Centermost of this cavern is a great fire-pit around which 
orcs frequently gather. The vaguely spherical cavern appears to 
be a mostly natural formation, perhaps the result of some long 
ago cave-in, or underwater lake. Stalagmites of various colors 
arch up from the floor like so many jagged teeth about the edges 
of the large cave, some of them broken or carved and stained with 
strange, leaping shapes and figures in various poses: hunting, 
fighting, running. The massive cavern is a crossroad of various 
tunnels that intersect here, where the air is humid and cloying, 
and the throaty din of crowding orcs turn the air to clamor and 
chaos. 
   A large trash heap is piled up to the north-east.

Inside an Expansive, Ring-Shaped Cave~
   A vast hall has been roughly-hewn here into the very roots of 
the earth. Offering a great deal of room around the wide ring, 
there are a number of crude stone tables and stools rising from 
the stone floor. Scattered haphazardly about is a large amount 
of clutter and trash, ranging from bones to rotting, insect- 
infected meat. Several orcs, large and small, gather to eat and 
socialize, effectively filling the massive halls with a plethora 
of gutteral shouts and clashing echoes. Dominating the center of 
the ring is a massive depression, approximately twenty feet down, 
leading to a flat valley-like pit. Four sets of steep, roughly- 
hewn stairways lead down into the valley-like pit, where several 
groups of orkin can be viewed running about and fighting. 
   A ragged curtain to the north has a decapitated spider head 
painted on it, and leads into a small cave.

Below the High Plateau, East of the Fire-pit~
   To the west the cavern stretches, clouds of thick smoke 
drifting overhead. The fire-pit rages nearby, it heat oft 
throwing up sweat on dark faces, and in the dim, red haze 
stalagmites shift and shadows play. Straw has been strewn about 
here, soaking up a layer of slime that has otherwise coated much 
of the rocky ground. A small pool has gathered at the far end of 
the cavern, filmy ooze covering the stagnant water, and fat 
insects crawling about it in blue-green fungus. High above one 
can make out a plateau jutting out from the wall. 
   Nearby is a trash heap, smoke and ash rising slowly from it.

   A pile of refuse, discarded rags, organic matter and other 
less savory trash, smolders here. Smoke and steam hang about the 
pile and glowing embers work their way along the edges of the 
more easily defined objects as bits of metal and other 
non-combustable materials are slowly left behind. The smell is 
unpleasant and seems to stain anything that remains here over 
long.

North of the Firepit, Branching off into Darkness~
   Here the cavern ends, north a tunnel beginning a sinuous snake 
into darkness, away from the almost unbearable warmth and 
humidity of the area surrounding the firepit. Where the walls 
narrow, there is a large pile of rubble - mostly situated to the 
northwest, broken stalagmites and misshapen stones piling up. 
   A fetid stink drifts in from the east.

A Large Bootskull Field~
   Steep sides, roughly dug from the compressed firmament, are 
approximately twenty feet high. Four sets of stairs, crude 
depressions carved out of the walls, provide entrance and egress 
from the area. Often serving the only purpose for which it was 
designed, when this "field" isn't occupied by bootskull 
combatants, it is filled with those honing their abilities at the 
violent sport. The floor is flat and very well trodden, it's 
surface near rock hard.

   Smoke filters in from the south, with sound and some light: 
flames leap to the south, guttering and wild in a firepit about 
which orkin gather. Dim red shadows dance on the darkly-veined 
cavern walls, while the tunnel itself is relatively low 
ceilinged. What shallow slope there had been to the north and 
northwest is more pronounced here, water pooling in dips near the 
walls of rock and filming over foully.

long shadows stretch across every surface, lending a sinister 
quality to the otherwise intense darkness. The floor is 
slightly sloping, descending a hand span or so from west to east 
and the walls look to have been hacked from the earth.

   The floor here continues its unfavorable varied surface. Deep 
pits and stone anomalies mar its surface and make foot travel 
unpleasant and slow going. The rough walls, compressed earth, 
ripple and bow in both northerly and southernly directions. The 
ceiling, apparently part of a massive slab of rock, is slightly 
uneven and is higher on the western side than the east. The 
tunnel itself is at parts able to accommodate two travelers 
abreast while other sections force progression in single file.

many as one would expect; while not clear of debris, this tunnel 
is a prime example of being highly trafficked: what trash there 
is clutters to the sides of the tunnel, the main passage clear.

flickering on its darkly-veined walls.

   The dark tunnel turns here, snaking southwards - to the east a 
large cavern hewn into the mountains opens up, renewed chatter 
and noise drifting in from that direction - towards an open cave 
and firepit. The floor, slightly sloped and uneven, is wet but 
rough. Bedding has been strewn about, the various nests not 
always occupied, and seem to clutter chaotically in the tunnel's 
hitching curve, leaving the passage east riddled by bodies and 
refuse, and the way south relatively clear.

Caved-In Portion of a Dark Tunnel~
   Here the tunnel ends abruptly, to the west a large rockfall 
blocking any and all traffic in that direction: the rocks 
themselves varying in size from tiny pebbles to skull-sized 
boulders, with fist-sized pieces of ore scattered among the 
piling, and bits of old bones and crushed skeletons amid the 
heap. Water drips in periodically through the spaces between the 
rubble, trickling off along down the tunnel's shallow slope east.

Foul, Fetid Cesspit~
   This cavern looks as if it began as an area of natural 
erosion. The ceiling a rippling mass of smoothed polished stone 
attesting to the passage of years under the sculpting hand of 
water. The cavern has been enlarged, the walls mined blank 
planes that still bear the marks of picks and shovels. Water 
quietly runs down the western wall and feeds into a pool that has 
grown to cover half of the floor. It appears that this area is 
used as a crude cesspool. The surface of the pool a bubbling 
mass of brown, black and green foam broken by solids floating on 
the surface. The odor filling the cavern further underscores the 
purpose of this area while hinting at the depth of the polluted 
water and the years that it has been used as such.

Veined Tunnel Stretching North and South~
   Hacked and hewn with little care for aesthetics, this tunnel 
passes along from north to south in a wildly deviating line. 
Being surrounded entirely by the stone save to the north and 
south, the floor of this roughly carved path is poor at best, 
allowing for travel that requires great care. The walls and 
ceiling of this passageway are worse in their crafting; being 
riddled with many more scars of the pick than the floor.

A Veined Tunnel Snaking North And South~
   Winding and snaking on north and south, this tunnel is quite 
narrow and cut roughly into the stone. Along the low-arching 
ceiling down the uneven walls are a myriad of criss-crossing 
veins cut into the stone like thousands of tiny trenches. The 
floor is lined with a thick layer of dirt and loose gravel, the 
odd abandoned rag or splinter of bone scattered through its 
length. Travel seems uneasy here due to the combined effect of 
the uneven tunnel and the loose debris lining the floor. A 
couple of guards stand here in the tunnel, watching those who 
pass.

Within The Cesspool~
   Beneath the surface, things remain easily as foul as they had 
been above it. The stink is muted but in its place is a 
joy-killing taste, one that bleeds into everything. Offal and 
refuse drift past at times - it is incredibly difficult to get 
anywhere in this thick, foul liquid mush and only grows more 
difficult as one nears the bottom of the cesspit, where some of 
the mush has solidified into chunks.

Stench-Filled Area Near a Tunnel~
   This tunnel has little special about it except to serve as a 
means of transportation. The smoke and heat from the south 
causes this area to be very warm. An overwhelmingly strong 
stench wafts in from the east. Small bits of debris and rotting 
trash are littering the easternmost part of this room. Ash has 
caused the roof and southern part of the room to turn black. 
Ruckus comes from the west as echoes bounce off the stone walls.

An Unruly Gathering Place in the Massive Cavern~
   The north-western corner of the cavern is, like the rest of 
the area, open and spacious. From here it is a span of about two 
hundred paces to the east side of the cavern, and a distance of 
about half that to the southern wall. The floor is bumpy, but 
smoother here than it is anywhere else around the great fire-pit. 
Most of what happens here is what orcs call "socializing," ergo 
it is often naught but a rowdy rabble that sometimes appears 
to be on the verge of an open rumble - and more than likely 
crosses that line on occasion. Tucked out of the way in the far 
corner is a staircase that leads off to the south. 
   Wafting from the east are the raunchy odors of a trash heap.

An Expansive Cavern Before A Tunnel~
   The air is a bit warmer here, most likely a result of the 
large fire-pit at the center of this great cavern. Hollowed out 
to impressive dimensions, this area could be, and often is, 
occupied by hundreds of orcs at once. As such, the only time 
this cave is remotely quiet is in the daylight hours, otherwise 
it is apt to be full of jeers, taunts, shrill laughter, and 
battle-cries. To the west there is an opening in the rock-face, 
the mouth of a tunnel that cuts further down into the earth and 
away from the cavern. 
   Quick to draw one's attention, especially when arriving from 
the tunnel, would be the plateau formation of rock high on the 
eastern wall of the cavern. To the south, a curtain of bone has 
been set in place, offering as a door into the southern 
Waterhole.

A Training Ring in a Great Cavern~
   Enclosed by perhaps a dozen lofty stalagmites that form a cage 
of sorts, this area has been hastily converted into a training 
ring, though the term is perhaps too generous for the effort that 
went into it. Because of the stalagmite ring around it, the 
training area is somewhat cut off from the rest of the cave's 
antics. One can see from the fifty or still standing in the 
corner that this was an area dominated by stalagmites until some 
were knocked down to create the open space there is now. The 
jagged bases of these still jut up from the ground, threatening 
to trip the unwary. The rock spires that remain standing form a 
veritable maze in the south-western corner beneath the winding 
staircase above.

Slight Incline in a Cramped Tunnel~
   As the tunnel advances westward, the downward slope increases 
more. The width of the tunnel tightens a bit here, but it is 
still passable for most things. The rounded floors and walls are 
rough, and on the ceiling several bulges hang low enough that 
stooping is required to pass them by.

A Dead End at a Door in the Tunnel~
   The straight tunnel slopes upward to the east, and to the west 
comes to the abrupt end of a jagged rock wall. With dimensions 
that make passage a tricky affair for creatures above a certain 
height, it is evident that this extension of the tunnel was made 
with but one end in mind: a speedy finish. Nothing about the 
space is overly appealing, nor indicative of any attempt at 
embellishment. To the north is a firm door hanging crookedly on 
its hinges, one not likely to be entered by force. 
   A decaying corpse has been nailed to the door to the north.

A Broad, Crudely Hacked Cave Lined with Nests~
   Raggedy nests line the walls of this broad, large cavern and 
its high ceiling stretches off into darkness. Looking partly 
hand-hacked (and that part crude at best) and partly natural 
made, this cave's floor is worn relatively smooth and its walls 
do not slope irregularly, though neither are they particularly 
uniform. To the north the cavern continues, though seems to veer 
sharply to the west, and to the south the cavern narrows to a 
fairly sturdy, if crooked, door. The sharp ends of nails stick 
through the wood of the door, bits of decaying flesh still 
clinging to their ends. 
   To the west stands a door in fair repair, set firmly into the 
end of a small dip.

A Cave with a Low Ceiling~
   This small cave branches off from the tunnel that, leading in 
from the east, dead-ends here. The ceiling slopes downwards, 
making it dangerous for any unwary, large orc, and is stained in 
places with smears of old, dark ichor, dried-up and flaking 
slime, and gray mold. It is quite cool in here, a considerable 
contrast to the eastern caverns. It is quieter, usually, as 
well.

L-Shaped Cave Filled with Crudely-Hewn Shelves~
   This L-shaped cavern widens to the west and south, and 
crudely-hewn shelves line its stone walls, filled with gruesome 
war trophies, weaponry, and all other manner of orkish 
decoration. There are obvious blood-stains beaten into the 
uneven stone floor, and a few of the larger boulders are stained 
suspiciously with what have might once been either brains, or 
vomit.

At the Bottom of a Crude, Winding Staircase~
   Here begins the crude staircase of the underground vault, not 
set in place as a feat of artifice, but shaped instead from the 
very hard earth that encapsulates this area. At its initial 
ascent, the stairs are short and long, making it little more than 
a slope that rises gently as it proceeds to the south. Rough and 
uneven, the imperfections produced by careless work have not even 
worn away with use yet making it so that even the shallowest 
segment of the staircase is akin to walking an uneven mountain 
slope.

Ascending a Crude, Winding Staircase~
   The leisurely incline of the staircase comes to an abrupt end 
here, as though someone realized after the fact that the initial 
slope was too shallow and attempted to make up for it here. If 
the stairs before these were short and long, these are tall and 
narrow, making this portion of the staircase more of a climb. 
The edges of the stairs are jagged, cruel to bare flesh, and not 
ideal handholds by any means. Falling back from here is a 
serious threat and would be rewarded by a painful tumble back to 
the bottom of the stairs.

A Winding Staircase on the West Side of the Cavern~
   The steeper portion of the crude staircase flattens out 
somewhat, allowing one to ascend without having to resort to 
climbing along, though it is still uneven, roughly-hewn, and 
awkward to walk on. Two steps are missing and require any hoping 
to continue to leap over a short gap, or likely slip and fall, 
possibly a twenty foot drop to the cavern floor below. Only a 
short way along the stone vault's western wall and the path is 
already now high enough that one can see over the flames of the 
central fire-pit. The plateau that these stairs lead to looks 
larger now, despite still being much higher.

A Turn in the Stone Staircase~
   Not overly high, this spot is still far enough aloft that one 
can see to the happenings of most of the cave. As the staircase 
is cut out of the wall itself, it is forced to turn east here 
because of the jagged, concave rock face. However, its architect 
did a poor job carving out this section which slants away from 
the wall towards the empty air. If this weren't enough, the 
steps grow narrower here and offer hardly enough space for a 
small orcs's foot, let alone a larger one, meaning that good 
footing is nigh impossible to find.

Midway Up the Stone Staircase~
   At this point the staircase is about midway between the cave's 
floor and ceiling. Though not as high as the plateau it leads 
to, it is still a considerable drop from here where the vastness 
of the cave is more apparent. One can see hundreds upon hundreds 
of orkish below, their raucous clamor echoing yet louder at this 
elevated position of observation. The stairs slope evenly from 
here, and above this point they broaden so that two could walk 
side by side in comfort.

Bend in the Stone Staircase Near the Plateau~
   Leading high into the south-eastern corner of the great cave, 
these stairs are the only way to reach or depart the plateau 
above. Due to hasty craftsmanship no doubt, there is a rock 
overhang that makes this bend in the staircase somewhat 
precarious, but still passable. Only those of considerable 
stature are apt to have difficulty passing, and still only if 
they attempt to do so hastily.

Atop a High Plateau Near the Roof of the Cavern~
   Jutting outward from the jagged, eastern wall is a plateau of 
considerable size. The ground is smooth and stretches out a good 
distance, offering a spacious area that overlooks all of the 
cavern below. Over the edge is a sheer drop of approximately 
fifty feet, and only the hard terra below waits for any 
unfortunate enough to fall off. Rising to just below the 
stalactite-ridden roof, the air is warmest up here. Only one 
point allows access to this space, a crudely fashioned stone 
staircase that winds around the cavern, connecting with the lower 
level in the northwest corner. The tunnel leading northward is 
lined with skulls stuck on spikes and other grisly decoration. 
The sounds of a crowd wild with bloodlust can sometimes be heard 
echoing from that direction.

one large being or two smaller beings to pass through its cramped 
dimensions.

   The height of this stretch of tunnel is confining making 
anything taller than an orc crouch to get through. The walls 
look to have been carved by hand, the path of least resistance 
dictating their uneven face. In several places stone stretches 
from the packed ground to the ceiling and appears to lend the 
area a stability that the crude construction might not otherwise

A Spacious Cavern Bustling with Orkin~
   Echoing in its size this area appears to be completely 
naturally formed. The ceiling is a arching dome that tapers down 
to the floor making vertical walls almost nonexistent. Its 
center is several times the height of an orc. Stalactites 
stretch down in several places and on occasion merge with 
stalagmites to form large smooth columns. The center is cleared 
and slightly depressed forming a natural amphitheater. The 
western wall, one of the few vertical spaces sports a series of 
shelves hewn directly into the rock.

wall near the passage out into the main hall is a hollow filled 
with moldering organics providing a breeding ground for fleas and 
other less savory denizens. The ceiling is fairly low and the 
walls an uneven series of expanses that look to have been carved 
out of the existing cavern as the need arose.

A Tiny Backroom Stained with Blood~
   This square-shaped room is rather basic, with just enough room 
for a desk and a few shelves, which have been hewn straight into 
the stone wall. The ceiling is quite low, and if someone of even 
normal human height were to stand within, they would have to bend 
to not strike their head. Along the stone floor is a trail 
leading from the northern doorway to the western wall of what 
seems to be ancient dried blood, though its hue has been turned 
to a dark hue of reddish-brown. Regardless of this trail running 
straight into the western wall, the only visible exit is the 
northern low-arched doorway.

Within a Long Chamber~
   This chamber expands a lengthy distance to the west, though is 
relatively narrow, measuring approximately eight feet wide. 
While no lightsource can be seen, a pale silvery glow seems to 
emanate from the myriad of elegant runes scribed all over the 
walls and ceiling. On the eastern wall a large and extensive 
mural has been painted - a map of the great Halls of Khazad-dum. 
At the bottom of the walls are small shelves cut into the stone, 
lined with all sorts of scrolls and tomes. However, they are of 
little use, as a single touch will disintegrate the brittle, 
time-eaten parchment. The western wall is entirely filled with 
runes of varying shapes and colors, many seem to form patterns 
which intertwince through each other. Trailing west along the 
lengthy floor are ancient pools of dried blood, turned to a dark 
reddish-brown over time.

A Slime-filled Tunnel's Bend~
   This L-shaped tunnel narrows precariously into a haven for
slime and muddy water that spares for boots only a thin band of
navigable rock running along a stone wall surrendered almost
completely to a swathe of mossy tendrils hugging it. To the
north the tunnel continues, while to the east the cavern widens
into a vast, hazy expanse of open space.

A Dusty, Old Forge~
   The smell of a closed room and rust permeates this area and is 
the first impression anyone gets at entrance. Quite large, this 
forge serves as home for several massive furnace ovens and 
smelting devices. At the western wall, four massive iron anvils 
have been bolted to the floor, a stone trough besides each, long 
dried. The walls, floor and ceiling have been carved out of live 
stone, worked flawlessly so no mark of hammer or chisel is 
evident, with intricate patterns carved across its surface. 
Shelves and what seemed to be cabinets or racks have been 
shattered and their innards lie, together with a large amount of 
debris, on the cluttered floor. Perfectly shaped holes have been 
drilled along the upper part of the walls as some sort of 
ventilation, but they no longer offer refreshment anymore. This 
old forge has not been used in a long time, and a thick layer of 
dust covers everything.

old air is completely still, no winds down here in the darkness 
of the mountain. This open area seems to have been carefully 
chiselled and worked by many skilled hands, and along the 
smoothened stone floor fine, straight etchings travel up onto the 
walls and the square ceiling, creating an illusion that the room 
is larger then it really is. Old furniture such as benches, long 
tables and cabinets lie shattered and scattered over the room, 
nothing that is of any use to anyone any longer. A low but wide 
staircase leads into a adjacent room to the east.

smoothened stone walls have remains of what must once have been 
beautifully coloured cloth drapes. Against the eastern wall are 
several large stone thrones, each of them having been a 
masterpiece of stonecrafting. Unfortunately they seem to be 
badly damaged by both time and whatever might have happened here 
in the past and what splendour they might once have had has all 
but faded. The room is slightly elevated above the gathering 
hall outside with the low staircase leading back to the west as 
the only visible exit.

boulders and pointy rocks. The only surface that are not made up 
out of rocks and boulders is the ground, hard, solid, rock cave 
floor. A few rounded tips of pale white bones stick out here and 
there, revealing that when the ceiling and walls came crashing 
down someone or something was trapped here. However now the only 
living thing one could spot would be the occasional rat darting 
in between the rocks.

   With the tunnel leading in from the east, this section of cave 
breaks into a crossroad, a link which connects several other 
paths together. Upwards, an incline in the surface level leads 
into the distant darkness. The walls here are blackened and 
covered with thick masses of cobwebs. The air which lingers 
depressingly here is musty, with the occasional waft of rot and 
decay sweeping through.

   The long, winding tunnels seems to be as never ending as the 
compact darkness that surrounds you. The craggy rock walls have 
traces of someone having used shovel and pick on them in the past 
but whatever they were hunting seems to be long gone. Instead 
the hard stone have been left untampered with for so long that 
strange, dark-green fungus have grown along the lower parts of 
the wall and over lose pebbles and rocks on the ground. The 
tunnel continues east, west and south into the darkness.

ground in places and the walls. All along the tunnel one can see 
traces of someone having hacked at the walls but whatever they 
were looking for is gone since long. Along the lower part of the 
walls are dark fungus colonies that follow the tunnel.

very rich with mushrooms. Large clusters of juicy mushrooms are 
dotting the cave floor. However it is evident something comes 
here to eat as some clusters have been freshly disturbed and 
munched on. One can leave the cave to the north, west and south 
while to the east a large wall bars anyone from heading east.

the narrow length, almost completely flat. The tunnel stretches

   In a sharp contrast to the narrow tunnel to the north it now 
widens tremendously, looking more like a natural rock hall then a 
tunnel. Large rock formations jut out of the ground, dark fungus 
climbing over them and small clusters of dark mushrooms hiding in 
their shadow. The ceiling is so high that it is barely visible 
in all the darkness. The enormous tunnel stretches out to the 
west and south while it narrows and shoots off to another tunnel 
to the east.

stone walls and those dark mushrooms that are spread out over the

   The tunnel continues on, darkness and cold rock dominating the 
area. Except for the same fungus and mushrooms that seem to grow 
all over the stone floors and walls there is nothing growing down 
here. The western side is dominated by a tremendous cave-in, 
large boulders and rocks towering up to cover most of the wall 
and whatever lies behind. The tunnel goes north and south from 
here while widening out towards the east as well.

An Enormous Part Of The Tunnel~
   Darkness surrounds you as the tunnel continues on. The rough 
stone floor has, like so many other places in the tunnels, 
clusters of mushrooms spread out and dark fungus growing along 
the walls. There are no traces of any living creatures in this 
naturally created rock corridor. It leads north and south as 
well as stretching out widely to the west.

A Dark Lake Beside a Petrified Forest~
   Here in the southeastern corner of the tunnel a lake stretches 
out. Far across the lake to the south one can see yet another 
cave-in but between solid rock ground and the boulders there is 
the lake. Exactly from where the water has come is impossible to 
discern from standing on the shore. The dark waters look calm, 
no winds down here in the tunnels and no sign of life. Near the 
waters edge, to the east, a broad array of trees, looking almost 
as if they have frozen in time stand proud and glorious. Their 
roots are grey and ashy, trunks and branches timeworn and 
bruised. This area appears to be a petrified forest.

A Large Cave-In~
   Another cave-in. The absolutely tremendous pile of boulders 
and rocks cover all of the southern and western part of the 
tunnel, what lies behind being impossible for anyone to know with 
certainty. However it is obvious the boulders fell long ago as 
fungus cover the ones closest to the ground and clusters of 
mushrooms are growing beneath them. The tunnel goes on towards 
the north and stretching out to the east.

north, west or south, all exits leading to more darkness and 
barren rock halls.

   This dark tunnel narrows a little, the ceiling very high up. 
There seems to be nothing growing here on the barren rock ground. 
However chittering and shrieking sounds can be heard echoing from 
somewhere in the distance. Obviously something lives down here, 
somewhere. North and south are the only ways one can move here 
as great tunnel walls stretch up to the west and east.

fungus and clusters of mushrooms spread out along the lower parts 
of the walls but leaving the middle of the uneven stone floor 
empty. The darkness and silence down here is so compact it is 
almost unnatural.

   A wide, rounded cave stretches out from the narrow tunnel to 
the north. There the sounds are loud, shrieking, chittering, 
wings flapping and the constant trickling of dirt and pebbles 
from the ceiling down onto the hard rock floor. The ground is 
covered in droppings and the many rock formations that jut out of 
the floor and the walls are as well. Looking up to the high, 
irregularly shaped ceiling it is hard to make out any details. 
In fact it seems covered in a black sheet, constantly moving with 
the wind. Except there is no wind down here in the tunnels of 
Moria.

   The dark cave slopes downwards a little into another high room 
cut out by the hand of time. This rooms looks less messy then 
the one to the west. Massive stalagmites break the monotone rock 
floor and with the stalactites in the ceiling creates a very 
unfriendly looking cave. Pale white bones from animals and 
humanoid alike lie scattered over the stony ground, whatever 
living here obviously carnivorous.

bothering any travelers. As in so many other places in the 
tunnels dark, slimy fungus grow along the walls but other then

   A small, round cave with a low ceiling and roughly shaped 
walls block your path onwards. In fact the ceiling is so low a 
normal sized adult human would have to duck down in order to 
move. A mass of small nests made out of old bones, rocks and 
different sorts of rubble spread out over the area. A few small 
puddles are scattered along the walls, perhaps a source of water 
for the creatures that live in this small little cave.

crude dome. The floor here is much less uneven in shape, seeming 
to have been ground down to be rather flat over time. Nothing 
grows down here, the only being a few bats high up and possibly 
the occasional rodent rushing past. The crossroads lead east, 
west and north.

Enormous stalactites jut out from the rounded cave ceiling, going 
so low many of them meld with the floor to create fantastic rock 
pillars. Strange dark fungus grows over the craggy hall floors 
and across the many stone formations. Nothing in this ancient 
hall seems to have been touched by anyone except time. The 
darkness continues to the east and south while to the west it 
narrows into a tunnel.

walls curve gently to the west and south, allowing no traveler to 
wander that way. Here, as in all of the cave, fantastic 
stalactite formations break the monotone ceiling to create 
naturally shaped pillars that sink into the rock floor. Fungus 
grows on the lower parts of the high walls and over the 
stalactites and the occasional cluster of juicy mushrooms can be 
seen hiding behind rocks and stones.

of those amazing stalactites, some hanging so low that they hit 
the floor and creates astonishing pillars, created solely by 
nature. Along the corners of the hall one can see the occasional 
cluster of mushrooms as well as a dark, strange type of fungus. 
The hall continues on north and west.

ceiling to create fantastic rock formations. Some of the jagged 
stalactites reach so far down that they meld with floor, 
effectively creating pillars created by time and nature. Towards 
the northern wall clusters of mushrooms dot the floor and 
strange, dark fungus grows over the lower part of the of the 
wall.

Entrance To A Mining Station~
   A vast, crudely cut cave stretches out towards the north and 
east. This particular part of the cave has one old stone 
building standing to the south along the wall. The building has 
collapsed since long, being more a pile of old rubble then 
anything. The walls and floors seem to have been hacked into 
shape by pick and shovel, revealing that this cave has not been 
made by nature. The ceiling is high and the size of the cave 
seems quite astonishing. Despite the darkness one can see traces 
of fire having licked over the stones at the ground and the walls 
but there are no signs of wood or anything else that might once 
have caught a flame.

   Several large houses have been hacked straight out of the 
southern mountain wall. Several stories high and with a angular 
shape, no smooth corners or gently rounded carvings. 
Unfortunately most of the old buildings have suffered either from 
the cave ceiling crushing them or simply having collapsed for 
reasons unknown. Rubble and debris litter the area. Amongst all 
the broken buildings and furniture that have found its way onto 
the ground one can spot the rounded tips of pale, white bones. 
Fire seems to have licked this area as well but everything seems 
made out of stone.

scattered along the rocky shores, most of them rotten or 
shattered. The waters seem calm, almost brooding, so very silent 
with a not a wave rippling the surface.

bags lie in heaps along the northern wall amongst the crates. 
Two cranes and several long chains hang from devices in the 
walls, surely used to move large quantities of ore. A couple of 
broken and shattered wagons of wood and metal occupy the middle 
of the craggy stone floor. There seems to be few things of value 
left intact here.

A Caved-In Mineshaft~
   The vast, carved hall ends abruptly to the east. A massive 
cave-in stops anyone from exploring further. Winches and iron 
cranes travel over one area where several broken wagons lie 
scattered. The iron in the cranes and chains have rusted since 
long, rendering them completely useless and none of the wagons 
seem fit enough to actually be used. The hard stone ground just 
before the caved in mining shaft is scorched by fire, with a 
rusty accretion covering almost all of the floor. Amongst the 
rubble and stones many pale bones are visible, bones that must 
have belonged to some sort of small humanoids. Splintered 
shields, broken weapons and rusted armor seems almost as frequent 
as the white remains of whatever used this mining station.

tunnel continues fairly straight onwards, north and south. Signs 
of someone having hacked out large chunks causes the walls to

supposed to, stop anyone from moving east and west and keeping 
the craggy ceiling up.

hole in the wall seemed to have had no interest in finishing it 
however, as it doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Apart from a few 
patches of fungus along the southern tunnel nothing seems to grow

of rock, but whatever they were looking for is gone now. Large 
chunks of rock and stone lie scattered all over the smoothened 
tunnel floor. One can continue through the barren stretch of 
stone either north or south, both ways the tunnel seems to

ease passage for whoever used to wander these stone paths. These 
tunnels are completely barren, nothing grows here, nothing seems 
to live here. It would be hard for someone to come up with a

rotten wooden ones, support the ceiling but despite this little 
trickles of dust and rock can be seen and heard falling from the 
ceiling to the ground. The walls bear many traces of having been 
hacked and exploited. However as one wanders along there are 
little glimmers of ore hidden in the craggy rock walls.

hollowed out walls someone have been doing a lot of digging down 
here. But despite this one can spot small veins of ore still

The Drift Narrowing~
   Here the long but straight drift narrows considerably. Making 
it harder and harder to walk more then two people in a row. The 
further north one moves the move evident it is the drift is 
coming to an end. Still even here one see clear traces of 
someone having mined ore out of the craggy rock on the eastern 
and western side of the tunnel. Like in the rest of the drift 
nothing seems to grow here, the ground littered with rocks, dust 
and pebbles from the ceiling and walls.

A Sudden Stop~
   The drift doesn't lead on for long before it comes to a sudden 
stop. A massive wall of relentless stone stops anyone from 
continuing northwards. Apparently whoever dug this drift stopped 
here. The walls to the east and south holds wide, large veins of 
ore, glimmering lightly despite the darkness. This drift was 
never finished and whatever strange manner of silvery ore that 
are in the walls were never mined. However the ceiling seems to 
be constantly leaking small pebbles and dust, revealing how 
unstable the tunnel is.

A Large Cave~
   A vast cave stretches out before you, a great contrast to the 
narrow tunnels both to the north and south. The stone floor 
holds many odd rock formations, some even shooting out from the 
craggy walls and high ceiling. One can see traces of picks and 
hammers at a few places as if someone have been here hacking into 
the walls but given up. Behind some of the large rock formations 
that litter the cave are small clusters of mushrooms and a green 
kind of fungus climb along the floor. The Cave is open both to 
the south, north and to the east.

Eastern Side Of The Cave~
   You enter yet another of the many caves hidden in the depths. 
This one seems to be an off-spring of the large cave to the west. 
The craggy walls towers above you but creates a much smaller area 
then the one to the west. Perhaps some twenty men could stand in 
here without having to push each other. Strange rock formations 
jut out of the walls and floor, hiding colonies of fungus or 
mushrooms. Apparently someone have been here in the past as the 
walls bear signs of having been hacked at with picks and shovels. 
The cave continues to the south.

Dark Depths Of A Cave~
   The strangely shaped cave ends here. Massive, unbreakable
walls of jagged rocks and craggy stone surround you, stopping any
movement in any direction except back to the north. Apart from
the fungus that seem extra thick in this area there are pieces of
broken and cleaned bones littering the ground. Behind a large
stalagmite one can see a large hole in the cave wall. A pile of
rubble rests before the hole and some distance beyond it, as if
a great force suddenly created the opening.

The Cave Narrows~
   The wide tunnel narrows rather drastically, doing a tremendous 
job at leading any travelers onwards. The walls are high as is 
the ceiling, craggy and unfriendly in its appearance. It is 
obvious no human hands have chiseled this tunnel, instead it has 
been built by the centuries that have passed down here in the 
depths of Moria.

Suddenly Narrow Tunnel~
   A narrow tunnel snakes its way through the depths of the 
mines, it's destination one can not see in the darkness. The 
tunnel walls stretch high up to a craggy ceiling and does a good 
job at leading anyone north or south. The occasional small 
cluster of mushrooms can be seen along the floor behind rocks or 
nooks in the stone. Dark green fungus of some kind follows the 
tunnel north and south and together with the mushrooms they seem 
to be the only growing things down here.

At The Mouth Of A Cave~
   The narrow tunnel have lead you here, to this open area before 
the vast darkness of a natural cave. Stalactites crown the 
ceiling just before one actually steps into the cave. The 
opening seems wide enough to make way for a hundred men and one 
can only imagine the actual size of the cave. Small colonies of 
fungus and mushrooms grow along the tunnel walls.

Darkness In All Directions~
   Having entered the cave one can easily be astonished by its 
sheer size. There are no walls in sight, the high, rough ceiling 
and the craggy stone floor being the only things solid that the 
eye can see. No hands have taken any part in forming this 
enormous cave for a long time. Instead it is the hands of time 
and whatever beasts wander the cold tunnels of Moria that have 
taken over now. Apart from small clusters of mushrooms beneath 
rocks and rubble and fungus growing at places along the ground 
there is nothing growing down here in the darkness

More Cave Darkness~
   North and west the empty darkness comes to an abrupt halt as 
great cave walls rise. Across the unevenly shaped stone floor 
lies rubble and the occasional bone from small animals. The cave 
is enormous, this area alone surely being large enough to hold a 
hundred men. Rarely is the silence broken and if so only by the 
occasional grunt or growl from somewhere deep in the darkness. 
To the south and east the cave continues.

any end to the darkness except to the west. The craggy walls 
that have been cut out by time and possibly someone long ago rise 
up to the high ceiling. No traces of civilization can be seen 
here, instead the cave seems to spread out further to the north, 
east and narrowing some but still being open to the south

   A dark lair stretches out before you. Whatever lives here has 
certainly left enough traces. Cleanly gnawed bones and skulls 
from various animals and humanoids lie scattered all over the 
natural stone floor and seem to form nests. The walls and 
ceiling that make up this area in the cave are rough and 
untouched by anyone for a very long time. The darkness is so 
thick one can almost feel it, no light anywhere down here in the 
depths of Moria.

spreading, traveling beneath rocks and stones as it moves to 
cover almost all of the southern wall. Clusters of mushrooms,

formations that shoot out of the ground

darkness. A mass of stalagmites break the monotone, craggy floor 
and at some places they seem to stretch ten, twenty feet into the 
air but still not hitting the ceiling. Strange fungus cover the 
odd rock formations but other then that the place seems void of 
anything growing.

cave itself is massive, stretching back far, and exceedingly tall,
but the place now lies nearly empty, ransacked and useless.

   Darkness surrounds those that enter this cave, compact 
darkness as if this small cave has never seen even a hint of 
daylight. The ceiling is fairly low, allowing a normal sized 
human to stand at full height and the tip of his head just barely 
touching the craggy surface. Small rocks and pebbles dot the 
uneven floor, a few sharp slopes and crevices making a journey 
across the cave somewhat hazardous if one is not careful.

   This part of the old cave may not be as wide but more spacious 
none the less. The ceiling sits a good deal higher, craggy 
stalactites hang down towards the floor but none of them being to 
impressive in size. A few of them seems to have fallen off 
during the years, laying scattered about the cave. In the far 
end a shallow, murky pool of mountain water lies silent and

scraps of bone and tufts of fur piling up in the corners of the 
small, semi-circular cave. A creaky wooden board near the back 
of the cave serves as a trapdoor, and an iron lock secures it.

spider head painted along it. The cave isn't particularly 
well-carved - in fact, the walls and floors are still adorned 
with tool marks. The cuts are rough, and could, perhaps, cause 
small cuts to unprotected feet. Two shelved are set in the room, 
one on the back wall and one on the right wall (as viewed from 
the doorway). These crude but functional shelves each hold 
grisly trophies: spider heads, patches from renegade clans, and 
all sorts of other skins and limbs collected from nameless 
creatures.

seemingly growing skywards. A large, circular sparring ring 
stretches out here, surely large enough to hold a dozen full 
grown men. The floor is covered in sharp pebbles, making it 
uncomfortable to walk and surely painful to fall, stained with a 
tainted black-blood, slashed across the ground, the remains of 
what would have been a horrific scene. There are a few small 
stone pillars put up along the eastern part of the ring, some of 
them having chains attached to them. Orcs of all sizes train 
here, the smell of sweat and blood, the warmth the only kind of 
heat found amidst a skirmish.

A Tunnel Beyond the Waterfall~
   This tunnel lies immediately behind the waterfall. Its 
opening is covered entirely by said waterfall, which is thick 
enough to obscure everything on the other side, but thin enough 
to be easily traversed. The tunnel is small and roughly-cut, and 
terminates to the north with a rotten wooden door. The hinges 
are so rusted that they seem to barely hold it to the wall. Upon 
the surface of this rotten door appears to have been painted a 
symbol-- but it has been washed away and repainted so much that 
one cannot determine what it originally depicted.

everything a surreal, foggy quality. The walls are lined with a 
few nests, and the floor around those is surrounded by litter-- 
mostly pieces of animal skeletons, but every now and then by 
bones of a clearly humanoid origin. A large pit can clearly be 
seen to the north, and from it the smell of years of rot. The 
opening to a small tunnel is covered by a thick, damp curtain, 
upon which has been painted a red-inked circle with twelve 
squiggly arms drawn out from it.

   With a cruel stench lingering in the air, this small boxed 
room provides little comfort for those imprisoned inside-- 
ensuring an uncomfortable stay. The walls are cold, scarred with 
scratches, perhaps the fingernails of its captured as they made a 
final attempt at escape. The compact soil flooring is hard, 
large jagged rocks spiking up in irregular patterns, their tips 
dangerously sharp. To the south, rusting iron bars stand strong 
and tall, the occasional voice heard from the hallways beyond the 
pitch of darkness. 
   There is a singular, dented brass lamp that hangs on the side 
of the northern wall, and it is kept burning with a dim, eerie 
light at all times.

and a such-sized orc would be forced to crouch, with the walls 
pressing against its shoulders. The walls are cut roughly, the 
rock jagged and sharp. Steam cloud what little air there is, and 
the iron bars on the southern entrance are coated in rust.

   This prison room is rather large, with the potential of easily 
holding up to three or four inmates comfortably. A strong stench 
lingers in the air, the smell of rotting flesh and decaying 
carcasses. The floor is compacted soil, patterned with jagged 
rocks which spikes up dangerously, tips extremely sharp. The 
ceiling is reasonably high, allowing most inmates more room then 
needed - but the room itself, boxed in walls and stuffy air, is 
no enjoyable stay for anyone or anything. Large bones have been 
scattered across the ground, most gnawed and snapped, a previous 
meal for a lonely cellmate.

The Floor Above the Pit~
   This cavern is dominated by an enormous pit-- easily twenty 
feet in diameter. It extends deep into the stone, too far for 
the eyes to see. From the pit rises steam and an almost 
overpowering stench-- a stench of damp, blood, and rot, aged 
beyond years. The cavern is crudely-cut, with tool marks 
scarring the stone, but the pit seems naturally formed, the rock 
eroded by time and water.

assaults your nostrils without remorse. Hard stone rises up to 
meet you as you fall freely through the air, towards the cavern 
floor, many a stalagmite jutting forth from the ground and 
presenting a possibly fatal landing site.

In the Air Over the Pit~
   Having left the edge of the lip of the pit, you now quickly 
approach the bottom of the gruesome pit. The awful smell, 
generated from the offal and entrails splayed across the chasm, 
assaults your nostrils without remorse. Hard stone rises up to 
meet you as you fall freely through the air, towards the cavern 
floor, many a stalagmite jutting forth from the ground and

A Grotesque Pit, Wreathed in Steam and Rot~
   From the rough, dark stone floor of this cavern rise up many a 
stalagmite, the ground uneven as it spreads upwards from sloping 
wall to wall. Slow drips of water rain down from the darkness 
concealed ceiling at lengthy, unpredictable intervals, the floor 
scattered with thin pools of brackish water. From these pools, 
and the walls, rise a thick steam, clouding the area in foggy 
white. Scattered across the cave haphazardly are all manner of 
humanoid and animal remains. Teeth, bones, limbs, skeletons, and 
entire bodies all rot and decay on the cold stone, a cloud of 
flies buzzing incessantly, the insidious sound of their wings 
assaulting the senses with equal force to the overpowering 
stench.

A Small Cave with a Hole in the Center~
   The tunnel to the east opens into a small cave, cloudy with 
steam. In the very center of this cave is set a small hole, from 
which most of the steam seems to issue. The lip of the hole is 
bloodstained all the way around, and, if one were to peer down, 
they would see the walls are also bloodstained. A torrent of 
rushing water can be heard, coming from the hole.

   The hole ends here, in a torrent of hot water. While not 
quite boiling, the water is scalding, and could probably cook 
someone if they were to stay in it for too long. The current is

A Rapidly Flowing River~
   This rapidly flowing river is barred on two sides. To the 
east, the tunnel through which is flows is far too small to swim 
through-- furthermore, the current flows from east to west, so it 
would take an enormous amount of strength to swim against it. To 
the west is set an iron grate, with squares wide enough to poke a 
small hand through, and nothing else.

surface. High above, stalactites hang from the ceiling, they 
range in length - but they all appear to be very sharp at their 
tips. 
    The southern wall stops here, its surface coated in moss.

The Southern Cave Wall of an Underground Lake~
   The cold roof above houses formed stalactites which spike down 
from the ceiling with vicious intent. The black water which 
fills this area is freezing cold, the bottom depthless. Small 
fish swim beneath the surface, the occasional sound heard in the 
distance as something disturbs the tranquil sounds of water 
dripping from the ceiling.

breathing space. The cave air is very moist and water drips down

'Da Bleedin' Fist Backroom~
   This broad cavern reeks of alcohol and other, fouler, 
materials used in the process of orkish brewing. Encrusted vats 
and rotted barrels occupie the corners of this dingy cave, and 
spiders, rats, moss, mushrooms and other intelligent life war 
amongst one another out of sight for dominance. The eastern end 
of the cave is covered by a wooden wall, in which a sturdy door 
opens inwards, leading out to the main room of a waterhole. A 
narrow, splippery stone staircase descends deeper in to the cave 
complex.

punctured dead in the center with a lock. To the north, an old 
stone-chiseled staircase elevates a few feet from ground level.

completely across it. Upon it is sketched a white-inked skeletal

chips, marring the blackened stone. Several shelves have been 
cut into the southern wall, each shelf relatively deep, 
crudely-hacked with what would appear to have been a blunt

jagged and hard, marred with scars from a mistreated lifetime. 
Stained, dry and wet blood has been splashes about the area in 
irregular angles, impression being that this rather large cave is 
a place of violence. Set on the eastern and southern wall are 
meat hooks, their tips sharpened, their meaning is vicious 
intent. Planted into the floor is a meshed iron trapdoor, 
leading into further darkness.

This place would be ideal, apart from the flies, for chilling

and slabs of oddly colored meat. Above is a trapdoor, leading

covered in mushrooms. Big mushrooms, small mushrooms, tall and 
short mushrooms-- they cover the cave, growing mostly from the 
ground, but more than a few sprout from the ceiling and walls, as 
well. One can hardly take a step without crushing several under 
their feet, which sends clouds of spores up, each eager to sprout 
even more mushrooms over this dank room.

in an attempt to keep the ceiling somewhat more stable and less 
likely to collapse upon the occupants. While the floor itself is 
still dirt, other small signs of attempts at civilization can be 
seen--a few rough, filthy rugs and bushy nests can be seen ground 
almost into the dirt and some sparse furnishings.

A Small Hollow In The Pillar~
   The natural erosion of this massive stone pillar has carved a 
small hollow into its side where chunks have fallen off into the 
hall below. The space is barely enough for three individuals to 
sit huddled together, and the roof is too low for any larger 
humanoid to stand upright. Spread over the entirety of the 
craggy, uneven floor is a mess of straw and rags, yielding a 
little comfort against the bare rock. In the back of the nest, 
dug into the center of the pillar, is a smaller cavity suitable 
only for storage.

A Narrow Tunnel~
   The nigh-imperceptible crack in the western wall opens up into 
a much wider-- though fairly narrow-- tunnel. It appears to have 
been more corroded than cut, and water constantly runs down the 
walls. The air is permeated with humidity, and the constant 
drip, drip-drip of the water around.

petrified forest. The trees here are all fair in color and 
angular and bony in form. The area appears to be rather quiet; a 
sign that nothing lives around this area, or perhaps that nothing 
survives. The air is very hard to breath - it is thickened with 
a dense, foggy moisture. To the south, a large pile of rocks 
guards a massive black hole - so wide that the tunnel beyond 
appears endless.

Inside of a Putrid-Smelling Hole~
   Half-way through this descending tunnel, there is a massive 
assault on the senses. The odor here is so pungent, it could 
burn at the insides of one's nostrils; the stench of rot and 
decay is overwhelming. The walls are covered with fresh slime 
and goo, and traces of scars mark the walls, freshly wrought. 
Wrist-thick cobwebs stretch across the wide cavern - each one 
bearing the remains of a victim, be it a sword, a piece of 
tattered armor, or a long since decayed skeleton. Upwards, a 
petrified forest can be seen, the trees motionless, waiting in 
the dark woodland. Deeper, through the tunnel, it is pitch black 
where the source of the foul odor originates.

gigantic shelter spun between three stalagmites. Cocoons of 
various shapes and sizes hang limply from their thick, gooey 
webbing. An unspeakably strong odor of death and decay settles 
on everything here, and escape can only be found through the 
difficult climb back into the tunnel above. A broad stone ramp

uneven black rock, jagged and pock-marked everywhere except the 
center, where it is roughly smoothed. The circle is fifteen feet 
at it's widest point, and surrounding it is several rock benches. 
The air here is thick and oppressive, filled with shouting, angry 
voices and the dim noise of the room above. A thick haze of 
smoke almost obscures the ceiling, motionless.

layer of rust. They are impressive in design, reinforced iron 
beams keeping them secure. Thick chains dangle from the ends, 
blackened by soot but seemingly intact. A little to the south, 
there is a recess in the wall, twenty feet deep, intended for 
storing crates. The crates themselves are absent, and in their 
stead is a large assortment of ragged nests, with a circle of 
charred wood and rubbish in the center.

little game tracks which fork off of this path. Some webbing has

   Upon entering this section of cavern, one would notice the 
intense smell of rot and decay. The walls here are all jagged 
with rocks, looking to be poorly mined out with crude, primitive 
tools - it definitely looks hand-made. Blood of both colors red 
and black mark the wall in a gruesome, macabre display - some 
small sigils worked with a sharp fingernail, others just 
splashing's. This area stands high above a dark, 
dangerous-looking chasm which lies below. To the west, a large 
boulder is either set in front, or to the side, looking to have 
been moved recently.

chasm barely the width of any typically sized individual. The 
rocks themselves appear incredibly sharp, some of them evening 
connecting with the other side of the chasm, forming small arches

Above, and very high above, a ledge juts westwards, levelling out 
to ground level. A strong odor lingers here, much like the rest

   The ground here is mushy and wet, almost like a swampland but 
underground. High above, the chasm twists and turns in a complex 
maze of jagged, spiny rocks, visibility completely disappearing 
into the pitch darkness. Here, the air seems to have stiffened - 
along with a noxious smell which dominates the air like a gloomy 
cloud. It's incredibly hard to breath down here, which leaves 
the possibility of life form to actually be living down here 
seemingly near impossible. To the east, a ancient gate welcomes 
newcomers, and on either side sculpted into the stone, two 
dwarves stand with a boastful, proud posture, battleaxes 
protectively held out in front.

   Low columns of stone lift up the cavernous, sloped ceiling of 
this massive, antediluvian tomb. The floor is littered with 
debris, from roughly-rounded pebbles to minute shards of bone, 
the latter grinding noisily underfoot. Dust hangs suspended in 
the air, the ancient breath of the tomb eerie and still. The 
tomb is roughly rectangular in shape. A formidable throne hewn 
from rock rises up a flight of stairs in the easternmost wall. A 
massive coffin of rock rests before the seat, and beneath the 
great domed roof of the tomb above. The curved ceiling is full 
of natural crooks and crannies, and seems to house a network of 
wide tunnels, inaccessible from below.

recently dug shafts, chasing veins of iron and other metals. The

constant hammering of metal tools on stone, echoing down the 
tunnels.

Through Crudely Hacked Mining Tunnels~
   The walls and ceiling of this tunnel are composed of rocky 
dirt, supported by thick wooden beams. It is slightly wider than 
the opening to the north, and ends abruptly before a dark chasm 
leading directly downward. Ropes and pulleys are visible, 
attached to a wooden frame that lines the vertical chasm. Jagged 
rock is underfoot, though its roughness has been somewhat 
smoothed by the passage of time and countless footsteps. Several 
large, already excavated veins have been drilled into the wall - 
large chips formed in the ore by what would be assumed as a 
blunt, bludgeoning object. 
   Orcs of varying size bearing picks and crudely fashioned armor 
and clothing swamp these Mines with their laborious tasks. The 
chatter here is amazingly loud, and with that comes the odd cry 
of help or pain which always overpowers and causes a silence.

slightly foul, and splattered white droppings on the floor 
suggest that these tunnels aren't completely deserted. The 
flutter of leathery wings overhead and the occasional rodent-like 
squeak further enhance that notion.

Originally formed like a tilted coin, the base have been expanded 
with much enthusiasm and little skill, leaving mostly sharp and 
uneven surfaces - some amount of the cut stone have simply been 
left and spread out to form a floor. A ramp leads upwards to the 
east and a metal gate have been set in the west wall. Strewn in 
a large heap on the right side of the gate are rocks with 
fractured low-quality pieces of blackish, opaque ore.

an abrupt, jagged end here. The far wall is concave and scored 
with the marks of picks, as if constant digging still goes on 
here. Loose rocks, pebbles and debris litter the ground thickly, 
causing any misplaced step to be an honest threat to one's bodily 
health. A pair of gutted torches cast the area into eerily 
shifting contrasts of shadow and light, and the dank, musty air 
is somewhat difficult to breathe.

rather cramped and cluttered, due to the low, jagged ceiling and 
the stony rubble strewn throughout. The ground is smeared with a 
suspicious-looking white substance, and the monotonously slow 
drip of water can be heard, broken occasionally by the quiet 
flutter of leathery wings. No natural light makes its way into

A Dome Cave~
   Upon entering this cave, it's clear that this area was dug by 
blunt tools and brute strength. The cave walls are heavily 
marred with scuffs - some rocks still poking out with jagged, 
irregular edges and points. The ceiling is domed, curling in at 
the top. The ground is earthy and gravelly - very damp to the 
touch. The air here is putrid in smell, the smell is a mixture 
of rot and other typical orkish odors.

A Long-Forgotten Cavern~
   Flakes of shiny metal glimmer from within the opaque rock 
walls which curl and twist upwards in writhing and cruel 
formations of jagged rock and brittle minerals. The battered 
remnants of times long past sit scattered about the 
rock-and-earthen floor, small puddles of dank water pooling in 
pockmarked depressions throughout. Splintered wood, scraps of 
metal, and broken skeletons all lay strewn in violently oppressed 
reposed, scorch marks and too-perfect rents upon the walls left 
as evidence of the previous occupants demise.

In a Cramped, Roughly-Hewn Passage~
   Immediately from its mouth in the large hole in the cave wall,
this tunnel is tight and irregularly shaped. It winds, dips
and elevates sharply and without reason. The stone of its
interior is oddly formed, as if it was hacked to pieces rather
than removed in turn by the strokes of a pick-ax. Large chunks
of rubble litter the ground and footing is difficult. After a
long length of twisting passage, the tunnel's direction turns
sharply downward. The acrid, bitter smell intensifies as one
moves further into the earth.

A Precipice Above a Bowl-Shaped Clearing~
   The tunnel halts its rapid descent into the rock and widens
abruptly into a small, flat, crescent precipice of stone
overlooking a clearing below. A powerful stench wafts from the
clearing, the smell so strong it competes with the heat of the
mountain's rocky bowels in casting shimmers on the air. The
tunnel continues downward in a passage to the side of the
precipice. Standing on the edge of the precipice and looking
down into the clearing below, a pair of sharp eyes may see where
the tunnel leads.

A Landing Before a Bowl-Shaped Clearing~

large enough to shield this landing from view lies a large,
bowl-shaped clearing from which a great blast of heat and stench
pours. The ground here is slick with slime and bonemeal.

A Bowl-Shaped Clearing~
   This large cavern has been cleared from the rock by a very
powerful force - judging from the deep rents in the walls, the
stone was not hacked with a tool but rather riven by the great
hewing strokes of some giant axe. A great mound of slimed fur
and bones sits in an unholy glob in the center of the clearing.
The smell and heat here is palpable and consuming, almost a
physical presence.

An Alcove Filled With Bubbling Noise~
   This small alcove, more a glorified hollow in the tunnel's
wall than a proper room, packs a great deal of stimulation into
its diminutive dimensions. Shelves carry jars that house strange
fluids, tiny creatures jellied and embalmed inside. Lurid
concoctions bubble and fizz, filling the alcove with an almost
musical sound. Candles set aside these potions throw variegated
lighting all about the hollow, their guttering light focused
through and colored by the unsettling, vibrant liquids.

A Cavern Mined in Haste~
   Urgency must have driven this expansion into the rock, for as
the cavern progresses to the east, the mining becomes less the
product of work and more the byproduct of what seems feverish action.
The walls and floor here are rough and pitted, carved by the most
haphazard swings of worn tools. No care has been taken for the
quality of durability of the excavation.

A Rough Cavern Narrowing~
   This cavern, hacked out with urgent strokes, degenerates from
a cavern and seems more like a glorified natural tunnel, such is
the roughness of the walls and floor resultant from its hasty
digging. No thought was given to its elevation - it slopes and
falls without pattern, and random pits and drops make it treacherous.

A Cavern Narrowing into a Dead End~
   The hastily-carved cavern narrows here into a tunnel and dead
end. The goal of the swift excavation becomes clear - at the end
of this tunnel glitters exposed ore seemingly without limit, with
much of the terminating wall composed not of rock but of the dull,
prized grey sheen. Whoever dug this place, however, clearly lacked
the time to harvest it.

An Abandoned Mining Camp in a Rough Cavern~
   This area of the cavern, rough and poorly-excavated as elsewhere,
bears in it forgotten tools and small, squat tents arrayed around
an ashen ring of stones covered with the dust of ages. Few pits and
drops menace here - this site was doubtlessly chosen for camp for
its relative safety. Still, webs loom strung overhead between the
juttings of rock in the darkness above.

Stands Overlooking the Arena~
   This cavern is large, stretching out in a roughly circular 
shape in all directions. The roof is so far above that it cannot 
be seen. A pit has been dug in the center of the cavern, 
stretching down about twenty feet, its edge lined with sharpened 
stakes, preventing those within from climbing out. The floor of 
the cavern around the pit has been left intact and is crammed 
full of benches and tables, allowing the crowd of spectators to 
sit while watching the battles played out below. The stench of 
old blood and sweat hang heavy in the air. Two heavily armed 
guards stand by the northern tunnel, blocking entrance. Crude, 
smoky torches line the walls, shedding light throughout the 
arena.

A Back Room in the Arena~
   This alcove set off from the stands of the arena allows access 
to the pens and gladiators' quarters. The strong odor of animal 
refuse and musk rises from the western tunnel. The stone is 
rough and unevenly hewn, leaving jagged edges and protrusions. 
Guards stand just inside, turning back those who try to enter 
with no business doing so. Torches line the walls of the 
tunnels, causing shadows to flicker and dance.

The lip of the hole is about twenty feet above, and lined with a

   This long, wide cave is littered with piles of rags and nests. 
This is the area provided for the gladiators to sleep and

the surrounding stone, leaving irregularities and sharp edges. 
To the west is a barred gate that leads out onto the floor of the 
arena, and northward lies the training room. The ceiling of this 
cave is low, perhaps only seven feet at the highest. The low 
ceiling combined with the number of orcs living here lends the 
cave a claustrophobic atmosphere. The walls of the cavern are 
lined with crude torches, though not enough to light the entire 
cave.

A Dingy, Cluttered Kitchen~
   The walls of this cave are coated in many layers of soot and 
old grease. Tables and counters are crammed everywhere, leaving 
only a little space to navigate the cramped room. A crude 
fireplace has been hacked into the eastern wall, nothing more 
than a shallow recess in the stone. A small hole in the ceiling 
allows smoke to filter out, carrying it elsewhere in the 
mountain.
