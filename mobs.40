a old durable man~
A old and durable man with shaved head stands here.~
   Prominent grey and white eyebrows lies above a pair of once 
piercing iron-grey eyes that now is slightly watery with age, the 
left one also catching a milky hue and surely impeding eyesight 
for this old man. The chin have weakened and the skin hangs 
softly on his skull marked with an armada of wrinkles. His head 
and face are shaved and leaves his original hair color a mystery. 
Broad shoulders, big hands and quite a lot of scars yields sign 
of an active and violent life with time arms and legs have been 
thinning and the shoulder sloping into those of an man on his 
last decades of life - yet the back is still straight and have 
not bent with the years.

A glabrous nubile-bodied young woman with stands here.~
   Devoid from all visible hair this young woman have a shaved 
head, removed eyebrows and displays an arranged or natural lack 
of body hair. Her body is young and nubile of average length and 
the skin-tone is the dark color of aged oak. The eyes are dark 
and serious set under a rather low brow that carries a burned 
mark that displays some sort of symbol or glyph with thin pale 
lines of scar tissue in the center of her forehead. The nails 
are long and reinforced with a dark-blue coating as is her face 
painted with a few simple lines in blue and black. She carries 
none other callouses and scars, a smooth body unfamiliar with 
hardship.

A giant albino leech is here.~
   This large, soft-skinned animal appears to be some sort of 
aquatic, slug-like creature, possibly an enormous leech. Its 
thick body is ghostly white and glistens with slime. A huge 
mouth, round and concave, is attached to one end, the interior 
fleshy and pale. Neither eyes not ears are visible, though there 
are a series of faint, off-white striations down its back.

a huge, slimy mass~
A huge, slimy mass is clinging to the ceiling here.~
   Long tendrils of what might be living matter hang down from 
above, their searching tips swaying to and fro. A huge, slimy 
mass clings to the ceiling, its dark, greenish-gray surface 
pulsating and flexing. Whether this thing is a plant or animal 
is difficult to tell, but from the rotten smell and the bits of 
bone and flesh that are visible protruding from its oozing bulk, 
it seems clear that whatever it may be, it is most certainly 
predatory.

A putrid, greenish-grey slime mold quivers here.~
   This oozing, pulsating mass is some sort of creature, though 
whether it is plant or animal is not readily apparent. Its slimy 
skin glistens with moisture, the mottled greenish-grey surface 
stretching and contracting as it moves. Though slow, there is a 
certain purpose to its progress, as it sends out pseudopods to 
search the terrain before it. Bits of dirt and debris stick to 
it as it goes, and it leaves a putrid, rotten smell in its wake.

A large silvery-grey catfish is here.~
   The large, scaleless fish is long and sleek, its soft skin a 
pale, almost silvery shade of grey. In contrast, its gills and 
eyes are both a bright, vivid crimson. The fins that run the 
length of its body are nearly translucent, and its wide, oval 
mouth is outlined with pink veins. Two thin, tentacle-like 
feelers are attached to the bottom of its chin, swaying and 
flexing as the animal moves.

A pale, spindly-legged crayfish picks its way through the area.~
   This pale, multi-legged creature appears to be some kind of 
crayfish. Its segmented limbs are extremely long and thin, with 
two tiny pincers attached to its front arms. A number of 
antennae stretch out before it, at least twice the length of its 
body. It has a flat, fan-like tail and a series of off-white 
stripes along the edges of its carapace. A pair of beady yellow 
eyes are set atop stalks on its head, and seem able to swivel 
easily in almost all directions.

A sleek, hairless rodent twitches its nose here.~
   This pale, hairless rodent has a sleek body covered in skin 
that is nearly translucent. Blueish-purple veins are visible 
along its length, and the shapes of muscles, especially around 
its formidable, toothy jaws, stand out conspicuously. A thick, 
worm-like tail drags on the ground behind it, the tip just 
slightly darker than the rest of the animal. Its feet are tiny, 
but possess sharp, curved claws. Though without whiskers, the 
creature's nose twitches alertly. Its eyes are black and wide, 
seeming overly large compared to the size of its head.

   This ghost-white lizard has a thick scaly body and a long 
whip-like tail. A series of sharp, short spines runs along its 
back, and its large feet have padded toes ending in curved claws. 
Its narrow head is nearly eyeless, the tiny pale orbs seeming to 
lack either color or irises. The animal's vivid blue tongue 
regularly flicks the air, revealing the interior of its mouth, 
which is filled with quite a lot of serrated teeth.

A sinuous white snakefish rises up on its front fins here.~
   This animal is long and fish-like, though its forked tongue 
and glossy scales indicate that it may, perhaps, be a type of 
snake. Its tail is a flat and wide, propelling it along with the 
merest flick, and is shot through with pale pink veins. The rest 
of its body is white and sinuous, with a thin, rippling dorsal 
fin that is semi-translucent and spans the length of its back. 
The head is narrow, with a rounded snout and gray, glazed-over 
eyes that seem to have no pupils.

Tolga ZAAK WARCHIEF imposing orc rust red eye GOTHAKRAN~
an imposing, rust-red-eyed orc~
An imposing orc with rust-red eyes is here.~
   Standing straighter than the average orc, this orc gives the 
illusion of being fairly tall for one of his race. His chest and 
shoulders are thick, and his ntire frame could be carved from a 
stone. His body and face are covered in dark scar-- small nicks 
and cuts cover everything from his thick, sloping brow to his 
jutting chin. He has fangs jutting from his upper jaw, 
protruding from his mouth and coming to a wicked point near his 
jaw line. Topping off his appearance is a shock of wild, orange 
hair, hacked haphazardly to keep out of his face.

a black, narrow-eyed orc~
A narrow-eyed orc, his skin a mottled black, stands here.~
   This orc is not particular tall or burly, but stands for one 
of his kind with an unsettling, vicious confidence. His eyes are 
a dark yellow and slit narrowly; cat's eyes. He is as dark as 
pitch, and though a few paler scars break the uniformity of his 
skin's black colouring, they are surprisingly few and far 
between. He is slightly bow-legged, with wide shoulders, and 
thick hands. His hair is an off-gray, almost blue-toned, and 
lies in short bristles on his skull.

a skinny orc with beady eyes~
A skinny orc paces back and forth behind a rickety bar, serving drinks.~
   Ghastly head sculpted like a battle-worn helmet, this small 
orc's skull is bubbly, displaying a fearsome collection of scars 
that run horizontal and vertical at random. Blistered, 
charcoal-black leathery skin is stretched across this orc entire 
body, lacking in tension around its limbs, notably under the arms 
and on the inside of its thighs. This figure is not large by any 
measure, its arms lean in muscle; appear as skinny and rawboned, 
a life of no intentional exercise. Thin ribs are visible through 
the skin, poking out, much like its upper body which tapers into 
a pigeon-chest. This orc has no eyebrows, but the wrinkles on 
its forehead suggest a frown as a casual expression. Black rocks 
are best to describe its alert eyes, beady and small, but equally 
set in distance from two small slits in the middle of its face.

A segmented, vermilion larva crawls here, leaving a noxious trail.~
   The length of a small orc's arm, this creature is a pudgy
string of bulbous red segments, each irregular and quivering as
it moves. It is marked with small black spots and a few wispy
hairs, especially on the head, a tapered beak consisting chiefly
of large, opaque, shining eyes and a mandibular mouth. The thing
is sluggish even when startled and leaves a clear, odious slime
on the ground where it crawls.

Yuknon fat humpbacked white-dreadlocked orc~
a fat, humpbacked, white-dreadlocked orc~
A pudgy orc with white-dreadlocks is hunched over here.~
   This orc's spine has been twisted and curved, shortening him 
and giving him an unnatural looking hump on his back. His face 
is heavily-scarred and mutilated, providing evidence of battles 
fought which settle proudly into his leering features. Long, 
sloppy white-dreadlocks are tossed over much of his face, and his 
neck croons against his deformation to allow him a view of his 
surroundings. His eyes are smaller than those of most of his 
kin, sunken into his sockets with the appearance of being little 
more than two jet-black orbs. Still, there is sinewy and 
animalistic muscle knotted around his limbs and extremities, 
hidden at his torso by flabby folds of fat and scar-tissue. A 
burn scar at his lips has permanently twisted half of his mouth 
into a constant half-smirk; the lips themselves less of a set of 
lips and more the fleshy remains of what once was.

   As tall as a man and twice as long, this creature is an
unsettling presence. A quartet of spindly legs carry it with
surprising silence and a pair of bulbous, multifaceted eyes
protrude in a kaleidoscopic glare. It is armored from its head
to the end of its long abdomen by a hard, deep red carapace,
leaving only its underbelly unprotected. Two limbs terminate in
a barbed, scything appendage sheathed in that same crimson
chitin. The creature is calm and impassive in its movements, but
the heft and keen barbs of the scythed limbs suggest the
potential for deadly action.

segmented vermilion larva~
a segmented, vermilion larva~
A segmented, vermilion larva crawls here, leaving a noxious trail.~
   The length of a small orc's arm, this creature is a pudgy
string of bulbous red segments, each irregular and quivering as
it moves. It is marked with small black spots and a few wispy
hairs, especially on the head, a tapered beak consisting chiefly
of large, opaque, shining eyes and a mandibular mouth. The thing
is sluggish even when startled and leaves a clear, odious slime
on the ground where it crawls.

mutilated boar hulking cave tunnel swine~
a mutilated, hulking wild boar~
A mutilated, hulking wild boar is here, its thick flesh tumorous and quaking.~
   This beast is girded by thick muscles and a thick hide, but
something is wrong. Its flesh is pitted with several deep holes,
and the area around these holes shudders and quakes. Its
underbelly has likely been savaged, exposing the lurid rose of
eviscerated swine bowels. The beast is frantic and frenzied but
it is possessed of jerky movements that are erratic, ineffective
and seemingly confusing to the animal itself.

a maimed, sallow orc~
A maimed, sallow orc is here.~
   This orc has had his share of pain: his nose is missing its
greater portion, the right hand has lost its index and pinky,
and he walks with a pronounced limp. His skin is a pale and
sallow beige, like thin paper stretched over the underbelly of
a cave lizard.

A juggernaut of a pulpy, throbbing larval-monster towers here.~
   An gargantuan mass of muscle and tentacular feelers pulsates 
here, its fleshy segmented body flush with power. A ribbed, 
wormlike body of bright fuschia terminates in a fanged maw 
seemingly too large for its owner. Teeth as large and cruel as 
swords bristle in the stinking mouth, enmeshing eachother to 
create a jagged nest. Sizzling, crimson bile drips continuously 
from between the teeth, causing a powerful, wretched stink and a 
hint of steam to dominate the air around this gigantic creature.

A starkly white-skinned, red-eyed orc is present here.~
The skin of this orc's face is very pale indeed, a very noticeable
and pure white color. Dangling from his lips are many piercings,
bones having been lodged there, all the same curved shape and
acting as a bristly outer coating for his lower lip. His eyes'
irises are a pure red, and the whites are very bloodshot. The
orc is not very large, nor especially broad, but he carries
himself with a noticeable confidence.

A variable orc is here, descless.~
The main notable feature of this orc is its face, which is a sharp
white color, unlike the rest of its skin. It carries itself with
some more confidence than the average beaten laborer, though is
no larger or broader than those.

a slender, beady-eyed orc~
A slender, beady-eyed orc stands by the door here.~
This orc is small and weedy in build, neither tall nor powerfully
built. His face is a sharp white color, bearing a blistered burn
mark there. His eyes are beady, and a deep red in color, set into
sunken eye-sockets upon a bony face. The orc is completely without
hair, on both head and body, and his left ear appears mangled and
crushed, scarred in the past.

   This small, barbed spider seems to always watch its 
surroundings with its many eyes. It cannot be longer than half 
of a small finger, but seems to stick out in its surroundings 
like a sore thumb for one reason or another.

a grizzled, rot-fanged black-blood~
A grizzled, rot-fanged black-blood stands here.~
   Short, squat and built like a stump, this black-blood carries 
himself with an aggressive forward lean. His visage is 
battle-torn, his flesh marked with any number of weapon wound 
scars. His body is heavily muscled, covered in thick slabs of 
hardened sinew. His eyes are yellow with pupils slit like a 
snake's. He has a blunt, snub nose that turns upward so much it 
could be considered a snout, and a mouth bristling with blackly 
rotten, jaggedly broken teeth.

A lean, red-eyed, black orc~
A black skinned orc stands here, red eyes searching its surroundings.~
   Somewhat tall, for an uruk-kin, and wiry with lean muscle 
along arms and legs, this dark black fleshed uruk seems 'young', 
with fewer battle-scars than most older mountain orcs, though the 
aggressive gleam in dim-red eyes is no duller for his apparent 
youth. Strong teeth filed into points line thin-lipped mouth, 
and a top-knot of greasy black hair sprouts from the back of his 
head.

A series of sigils have been carved into the face of this humanoid
figure, now unrecognisable. Its form is hunched forwards, and in
the early stages of decay. Its lips are frequently parted, and just
behind them, a chunk of blue-green stone is visible, a faint light
shining from it.

Yuknon fat humpbacked white-dreadlocked orc YuknonNPC~
a fat, humpbacked, white-dreadlocked orc~
A pudgy orc with white-dreadlocks is hunched over here.~
   This orc's spine has been twisted and curved, shortening him 
and giving him an unnatural looking hump on his back. His face 
is heavily-scarred and mutilated, providing evidence of battles 
fought which settle proudly into his leering features. Long, 
sloppy white-dreadlocks are tossed over much of his face, and his 
neck croons against his deformation to allow him a view of his 
surroundings. His eyes are smaller than those of most of his 
kin, sunken into his sockets with the appearance of being little 
more than two jet-black orbs. Still, there is sinewy and 
animalistic muscle knotted around his limbs and extremities, 
hidden at his torso by flabby folds of fat and scar-tissue. A 
burn scar at his lips has permanently twisted half of his mouth 
into a constant half-smirk; the lips themselves less of a set of 
lips and more the fleshy remains of what once was.

A massive, barrel-chested orc looms here.~
   The stygian-skinned orc before you is simply monstrous in 
size, possessing cord-like muscles that ripple with every moment. 
Dense mats of coarse hair cover his hefty chest and bulging 
forearms. The bald pate of this creature bears no hair. His 
forehead slopes considerably down into a protuberant brow, which 
hangs heavily over pale white orbs with red cat-like pupils. A 
squat nose with nostrils that flare out frames the center of his 
face. Beneath it, black-chapped lips are set in a cruel line. A 
lantern jaw dominates the lower portion of his face.

   This orc is a horrific sight of torture and pain. His skin 
has been torn in parts so deep that the bone is visible. Oozing 
black blood creeps down his frame, an innumerable amount of small 
wounds its source. He his without eyes, fresh blood and gore 
evidence that they were recently lost. He has no hair, indeed he 
has no scalp, the flesh having been mercilessly torn away. He is 
a withering mess that is truly on deaths doorstep.

a gargantuan, ice-blue serpent~
A gargantuan, ice-blue serpent is situated here, several hundred feet long.~
This serpent is truly enormous, as large as several buildings
and strong enough to support itself reared up to full height 
with ease. Its scales are about a foot wide each, firmly
embedded into its flesh and clearly thick and resilient. It
radiates cold from its very body, chilling the area around it
and frosting water vapour from any nearby breaths. Its fangs
are scaled along with it, nearly man-high in their own right,
and viciously sharp. It has four in each jaw, and they are
all the width of tree-trunks. Its eyes are beady by scale,
but nevertheless enormous, a foot in diameter apiece, and a
piercing yellow color. Flaps on each side of its head waft
freely in the air, and a forked tongue is visible within its
magnificent maw.

a group of giant ants~
A group of giant ants roam here.~
These creatures are fearsome in size, easily man-high each one
and covered in thick, chitinous armor to form a near-impenetrable shell. They
have long, ferocious mandibles, riddled with spikes and barbs which recurve inwards,
offering the creature a truly formidable bite. There are six individuals present in
this group, each one mighty and potent in its own right.

Variable orc for the Maker. Really crap. ByNom~
A really, really crappy orc.~
(null)~
This orc is very pale indeed, dull eyes focused dead forwards with little
more than a flicker of vitality and verve. They move slowly and with a
very notable lack of strength, hardiness, or resilience. Their demeanour
is shuffling, their gait stiff and ungainly, and their features relatively
unbruised and smooth.

Tolash Bloodwatcher Dragon yrch giant great-helmed twisted bleeding byCeredir~
a great-helmed, bleeding giant yrch~
A great-helmed, bleeding giant yrch stands here, his form twisted.~
   Large and wide, this corrupted creature is scarred heavily, 
its twisted form covered with a number of stringy veins. Its 
head, horrendously assymetrical in its shape, is entrapped within 
a great helm forged of black steel, a crown-like masterpiece 
bristling with sharp, thorn-like points. However, not all of 
these thorns reach only outwards from the odd piece of armorment. 
A great many long, sharp blades turn and point inward, cutting 
and piercing this creature's mottled skin. A number of tiny 
points are aimed straight into the hateful yellow eyes, drawing 
blood with every movement, every blink of an eye, making this 
yrch seem to weep blood.

fleshy red tower byNom sporetower~
a fleshy red tower~
A tower of red flesh rises here, a few feet high.~
This tower looks to be made of plant matter, moist and cool, rising
a few feet into the air from the ground. It is securely planted in
place, and appears to have no moving parts. A series of purple-pink
flowers are situated near its top end, dark and sticky fluid visible
within, with many spores attached. The entire structure of the thing
is very unusual in appearance, with a thick layer of hardened chitin
covering its outer extremity.

A small, red sporeling mills about the tower here.~
This tiny creature has been formed by rapid sporulation from
the nearby tower, and fights viciously to defend its main body.
It flails short, thick vines about its body, and uses chitinous
teeth in a large mouth at the top of its frame to bite with. It
is propelled from place to place by the action of these vines,
and appears to just be whirling vines and a big mouth on a body.

A bullish orc is here.~
   Burns and scars mar the bald head of this ashen creature. He 
has a monobrow, which hangs above his big black eyes. A bulbous 
nose bulges from the center of his face, a wart on the very tip 
of it. Sallow, frog-like lips open up to reveal a mouth missing 
half its teeth and the other half in various states of decay. 
Thin cords of muscle ripple underneath his skin, giving his 
otherwise average frame a menacing look.
