Before the Minastir Fountain and Manse~
   A paved white-stone pathway rounds a large fountain. Beyond 
it the pathway stops at a small promontory that gives a view 
westwards and access below. Southwards the path leads directly 
between low buildings that are built directly into the 
overhanging rock wall. Northwards, larger dwellings with follied 
spires and buttresses stare westwards. Finally, towards the 
eastern Falls of Sorontil, the Manse rises up over two floors, a 
white stone facade lending aid to the small globe lanterns set 
about it, pools of light pushing back the gloom from the ravine's 
tilting weight above. The manse itself is a simple squared 
design, iron bars protecting the two tall windows the top floor 
and the large front door barring easy access through its thick 
iron hinges and freshly re-strapped iron bands about the oak. 
Two tall chimneys jut out above, between a single small buttress.

On Ralle Minastir Approaching the Manse~
   The stone pathway leads northwards around a slight kink as it 
rounds the edge of the Upper Tier manse towards a circular 
fountain. Here, low buildings are set on each side of dark 
stone, plain and utilitarian in design with small square windows 
and simple wooden doors, rising to perhaps twice the height of a 
visitor from Nurn. A gloom begins that deepens southwards as the 
oppressive leaning rockwall begins to block out any view above. 
Set against the walls of the manse and the eastern building are 
the remains of iron pyramid frames hanging firmly from small 
holes. In places climbing ivy struggles to survive amongst the 
framework. Over the large western door a freshly-painted black 
sign hangs, creaking awkwardly in any breeze, displaying a 
gold-colored impression of a cruelly curved scalpel. The windows 
have been recently sealed with bricks and dull plaster.

A Darkened Corner of Southern Ralle Minastir~
   The darkness that descends from the oppressive mountainside 
threatening to press down and crush all below is somewhat offset 
by carefully spaced lampwright-crafted metal poles with oil-lit 
glass globes set into them along the length of the stone path 
between buildings here and beyond to the east. They are not 
free-hanging due to the high winds that tend to flow here and 
gust. Every day as darkness falls the black-coated and hooded 
Lampwright walks here and lends a gentle glow where they pass. A 
larger western-set building keeps it double doors open usually, a 
glint inside from the many lanterns revealing curiosities and 
items fetched back perhaps from other countries. Through the 
windows of the smaller southern shop, dozens of flickering flames 
from candles and lanterns seem almost out of place here, as if 
disturbing the overall sense of a dark pressure from above.

Eastern Path On Ralle Minastir~
   The buildings maintain a somber watch on the flagstones that 
stretch east and west here. With precise measurements, the 
painted iron lamp posts stand on either side of doors into the 
dwellings and shops here. The rush of the waterfall crashing 
into the deep trough of the Pipe House to the northeast reaches 
here under the dark rock and snaking trickles of water above. 
While the northern building seems abandoned, if in good repair, 
to the south a door has been decorated with thick strips of cloth 
dyed dark crimson and rich purple, that have been set into the 
frame. Through the square window, the well-illuminated interior 
seems to be filled with attire of a rich quality, some clearly of 
Nurn design, others of Harad or beyond. 
   At the far end of the roadway on the eastern side the ravine 
wall rises and leans overhead. A large stone door has been set 
into this natural barrier.

Chairon's House of Healing~
   Visibly the workplace of a respected healer, this room is well 
decorated, and is kept exceptionally clean and well-lit. The 
floor, built of even, well-waxed mahogany planks, is carpeted by 
a lush tea-colored woolen carpet. All four of the walls are 
covered with rows of stained, dark-colored shelves filled with 
all sorts of multicolored jars and long-necked bottles; the only 
exits out of the room are by an ascending narrow spiral staircase 
or through a wide door set in the eastern wall. Several dozen 
enormous candles are evenly arranged around the room, providing 
even, and very bright lighting for the windowless room.

The Flame of Malinorn~
   A musty smoke tinged with the smell of oil hangs around this 
small shop, though it is almost overwhelmed by the impact of 
dozens of intermingling incenses being burnt continually. 
Someone has taken clear intent to ensure that as much of the 
furniture as possible is hewn out of stone, and it is clear that 
the chandler who runs this shop was concerned that the place may 
set ablaze. Numerous barrels are stacked in the corner by a 
table as well as half finished lanterns and a large bundle of 
torches, both finished and unfinished. Numerous shallow 
blackened-maple shelves line the walls, split into scores of 
small drawers with symbols written on each. Many are open and 
bags of incense and wrapped wax are visible.

North of the Swan Fountain on Malle Minastir~
   Heading north from the fountain, slightly larger dwellings are 
offered to those with the influence, power and the coin to earn 
or afford them. They are seemingly comprised of four rooms over 
two floors, well-endowed and comfortable, judging by their gates 
and scrubbed outer walls. Large windows face westwards to offer 
sight of the dusk. The stone path leads towards the first of 
these dwellings, or at least the high iron fence that surrounds 
the buildings, before turning eastwards to run parallel between 
it and the manse of the Priest-Lord. A low wall reminds 
pedestrians that westwards a drop to the Middle Tier of Romenna 
beckons. Underfoot, a constant vibration can be felt, along with 
the sound of rushing water.

   A spicy scent pervades this opulent building, the only real 
adornment of the austerely luxurious surroundings. Stone 
furniture and walls are starkly outlined and edged with fluted 
detailing, with some stylized and elegant tapestries in silver 
and black hanging on the walls to provide a backdrop to the 
various display cases, racks, and shelves full of clothes.

A Modest Entrance Hall~
   The few people who pass outside on Malle Minastir tend to 
stare in through the barred tall windows, the lit orbs at night 
pooling inside this small entrance lobby and casting their 
shadows upon the far wall; flickering reminders of a dream Gondor 
held to reoccupy the Mountains of Shadow. A large oaken front 
door is set with thick iron hinges and freshly re-strapped iron 
bands between the windows. This is no more than a partition 
between the two larger rooms set through doorways leading north 
and south; a fireplace occupies most of the eastern wall, 
permanently kept alight by the quiet servants and slaves who pass 
to and fro, heads ducked and shivering on the whole, for this 
place seems to carry with it a chill from the very roots of rock 
it is set upon. 
   The walls are painted a scrubbed white, but little of them can 
be seen between the multitudinous collection of mounted and 
stuffed hunting trophies, paintings of proud, pale men and women, 
scenes of battling Argash on tapestries, painted glass and 
ceramics and shelves set with dozens of bronze and ebony 
statuettes. A heavy aroma overpowers the usual dampness of the 
buildings here, seemingly drifting down from the stone stairway 
that leads directly above. Two guards stand at the base of the 
ascent, blocking all but the Lord and his family from heading up.

A Newly Appointed Auction House~
   What was an abandoned, dusty hall has been clearly converted 
recently into a light and airy chamber, its walls oak-paneled and 
high ceiling painted with murals of famous heroes of Nurn and 
Kings of Numenor long-dead. The floor stretches to a western 
doorway through which clerks and well-dressed auctioneers come 
and go, carrying scrolls or presenting items on sale. A dark red 
thick carpet lends a comfortable feel to this quiet and 
respectable auction house. 
   At the far northern end of the elegant chamber, furnished with 
plush chairs and couches, the auctioneer stands on a raised brass 
platform before an ornate silver-etched pedestal.

A Sloping Promontory on Armenelos ~
   When the waterfall flows and the pipes are full, a constant 
thunder can be heard to the east behind the Manse that presents a 
castellan view of the top tier, along with the creak and shudder 
of water flowing through hidden copper piping. Steps lead down 
from the fountain's promontory to the Middle Tier of Romenna, 
stretching westwards as they descend, with a large gentle-sloping 
ramp next to them for the easy carriage of horses and the like. 
Exposed and windswept by gusts from above, nonetheless the 
promontory offers a clear view of the buildings and roadways 
below. Mostly one-story buildings below, this place is on almost 
the same level as the rooftops. Larger gatehouses block the way 
at the western walls some distance away and to the north and 
south the canyon presses in upon dark stone buildings that are 
set into it as if a giant reached out and pulled them almost free 
of the mountainhold.

Just Within a Spacious Cavern~
   To the south, the spacious cavern is abruptly cut off by the 
walls built to separate them from the buildings by the occupants 
in ages past. One jagged edge of the cavern turns in a wide 
curve from its meeting against the southern wall in the west off 
to the north-east, while the cavern wall to the south barely 
extends beyond that made from stone blocks, in which the door, 
cracked and now with bent hinges, is set. The floor is smooth, 
though covered now in brittle, withered roots, mostly cleared 
away, but still visible within the holes their growth bored in 
the stone. Several stone tables are set within, scratches 
visible about their bases and those of the benches around them. 
Bronze lanterns, no longer casting out light over the area, have 
been set at intervals along the wall, ornate arms holding the 
chains they hang from a short distance from the cavern walls.

An Open, Spacious Cavern~
   This stretch of the cavern is set against a naturally nearly 
flat section of cavern wall to the south, vast expanses of cavern 
opening to both the north and to the west, while the eastern wall 
curves east towards its northern end. More long tables fill this 
area, continuing the rows off to the west. Small holes filled 
with now withered roots line the floor, and in places, fragments 
of iron thorn-bushes, no longer alive, remain upon the walls. 
The occasional lantern has been fixed to the walls here, but they 
no longer cast out light.

Within a High-roofed Cavern~
   This section of the cavern, though wide, is empty, the 
lanterns along the northern wall few and far between, no longer 
casting light into the darkness. To the east, it narrows into a 
tunnel which is sloped ever-so-slightly upward, while to the 
south and to the west, where the northern wall slopes off to the 
south, several rows of long tables with more frequent lighting 
are visible. Though the area is clear of the iron thorns save 
for a few dead clusters wedged into cracks on the walls, the 
tables still bear scratches, and within tiny holes across the 
floor are the withered roots.

A Narrowing Tunnel in the Caverns~
   While the southern wall angles northwards towards the east, 
narrowing the tunnel significantly in that direction, the 
northern wall remains even with that of the spacious cavern to 
the west. The tunnel is dark here, and the floor has been worn 
mostly smooth, and is only slightly off-level, though a careful 
analysis would show that it rises slightly yet definitely to the 
east; the floor still bears the multitude of tiny tunnels which 
have been bored through the stone by now-dead roots.

A Natural Intersection North of a Guarded Door~
   Here, the spacious cavern to the west narrows to something 
little more than a wide tunnel. Far from cramped, even so, the 
tunnel is high, widening towards its slightly-rounded roof; 
miniature tunnels, smaller than a finger, weave their way 
throughout both the roof and floor of the tunnel. Southwards, a 
wall fashioned from blocks of stone blocks the way entirely, and 
a narrow, sturdy stone door, set in its centre, has been left 
open, one of the hinges obviously bent out of shape; what would 
be the door's southern face, were it close, bears signs of 
battering. Set in the natural walls just to either side of the 
artificial one are set bronze lanterns, their interiors bearing 
the black smudges of fire, but now cold and lightless.

A Cavern Tunnel Blocked by Debris~
   The darkness here, barring some artificial light, is complete; 
those who can see either naturally or with the aid of such light 
might see the rough-edged tunnel continuing to the east, neither 
widening or narrowing, and, indeed, it is remarkably steady save 
for a slight upwards slope towards the east, until it is cut off 
by the sudden appearance of broken stone which fills the tunnel 
from top to bottom, completely blocking off all further passage. 
Though some loose rubble still remains, many of the rocks are 
lodged firmly in place, held in position by the weight of further 
stones above, and over the walls, the boulders of the cave-in, 
and small patches of the floor grow great, iron bushes which bear 
deadly thorns, though brittle now; beneath the lightest touch, 
they might break away, revealing the tunnels bored through the 
stone beneath to be filled with dead, brittle roots.

A Narrow Passageway South of a Stone Door~
   The cavern here is little more than a narrow, jagged-walled 
tunnel through the stone -- narrow, that is, in comparison with 
the rest of the caverns, for it is still more than wide enough 
for three men to walk comfortably side-by-side; still, the great 
height of the tunnel makes it appear narrower than it is. The 
floor is worn almost smooth, but, in its surface are numerous, 
tiny tunnels, some bearing husks of hollow black root. To the 
north, a wall made of stone blocks cuts off passageway north, 
save for a narrow, sturdy stone door set in its centre; the 
passageway widens to the south after a slight protrusion in the 
rocky walls, all lined alike with the thorn-bushes.

A Yawning Cavern Before a Gate~
   As this tunnel continues south, it widens once more into a 
yawning cavern. On the walls high above, torches have been set 
within ornate bronze sconces which line the western wall at 
intervals, though they are now burnt out and useless. Though the 
western wall is almost even, the eastern shows no such 
inclination to order, protrusions, crags, and other formations 
lining it, small fragments of dead, metallic thorn-bushes lodged 
in a handful of places. Further to the east is a bronze gate, 
set into a framework of bars and grilles. Centred upon the gate 
itself is an enormous bronze mask, its features stern and 
impassive. Its polished surface, left open, gleams should light 
be presented to it, a function which likely would have been 
served by the two torches fixed to the grille on either side, now 
burnt out. Through the large, empty eyes, one can see into the 
darkness beyond, giving it an eerie appearance despite its regal, 
solemn features.

Within a Storage Area in the Caverns~
   Here, the cavern dips slightly, elevation slightly lowered 
into a naturally rounded end to the cave. Along the western 
wall, torch-bearing sconces are still set at regular intervals, 
containing only charred, blackened stubs, now; but here, they are 
joined by shelves, some carved into the rock by pick, hammer, and 
chisel, and some fixed to the stone by bronze brackets, not all 
still fixed in place. The shelves bear scratches as though of 
sharp blades dragged short distances across their surfaces, as do 
some of the items left upon them. The things stored here are of 
varying use, from the tools used to alter the area, to spools of 
rope, to hammers made for use in a forge.

Within an Intersection in the Caverns~
   A juncture of four passageways occurs here, the southern one 
elevated somewhat above the rest. That passageway is blocked off 
by an ancient-seeming yet still sturdy wall of stone blocks; in 
that wall has been set a heavy door of similar age. Within its 
face, however, has been etched a large, dotted circle, its radius 
nearly the width of the door, and with another dot in its centre; 
the carving has been filled with bronze inlay, and, while the 
door is unhinged at the base and no longer opens or shuts, the 
designs themselves are free from the thorn-scratches which occur 
in some places along the tunnel walls. To the north, a wide 
tunnel meanders, while to the east, a straighter path cuts down 
at a steeper angle, and west, towards the bronze gate and the 
lattice of bars and grille in which it is set, the descent is 
steeper still. In all cases, the floor has been worn smooth, and 
might be slippery if not for the somewhat rougher edges left by 
the multitude of miniature tunnels delving down into the floor, 
many lined with the hollow husks of roots.

   This segment of the cave slopes gradually up to the west, the 
heavy door set into the ancient brick wall to the north cutting 
it off from the rest of the caverns is the lowest point to this 
natural chamber. Within, four decorative bronze lanterns hang, 
one on each side of the door, though they now no longer burn, nor 
do the others along the southern rock-face. The floor here bears 
the same miniature tunnels delving down into the stone across its 
entirety.

The End of a Cavernous Tunnel~
   The caverns here are hushed and muted, bearing an odd air of 
solemnity. Along the northern and southern walls, the stone is 
unmarred in several large rectangles, apparently the 
resting-place of chests, once; where the floor rises to the the 
west, just beneath an opening in the ceiling above which has been 
blocked off by what appears to have been a series of boulders 
falling from above, sits a worn stone table, free of the 
thorn-scratches which mar much else in the caverns. The 
root-holes bored in the floor are here as well, though at 
intervals less frequent than elsewhere. A large, bronze lamp 
sits in its centre, now casting no light across the room.

deadly, but their shine is dull now, and a touch might break 
portions off, revealing the tunnels filled with the withered 
husks of roots that once supported them. The tunnel itself sits 
just off the main passageway to the south, in which direction it 
rises upwards slightly, curving east around a stone pillar. 
Though wide, this passage is not especially high in comparison to 
some places in the cavern, though it is certainly more than high 
enough for a man to stand.

A Wide Side-tunnel Approaches an Intersection~
   This wide tunnel sits just off an intersection in the main 
passageway to the south, a slight downwards incline to the floor 
as it curves in that direction around a pillar to the southwest. 
Though naturally wide, the walls of this passage bear the 
remnants of metallic, thorn-bearing foliage which prevents 
passage side-by-side in any numbers without brushing against the 
bushes, an act which might hurt still, but which would tear off 
segments of the bush; underfoot lie brittle, dead, black roots 
which crunch with passing footsteps. Though the passage is not 
especially high in comparison to some places in the cavern, it is 
certainly more than high enough for a man to stand.

Within a Cavernous Intersection~
   Four tunnels spread out from this wide intersection into the 
darkness, those winding away to the north and south wide yet 
meandering passages, rising slowly as they move from north to 
south. From east to west, however, the passageway, save in the 
intersection itself, is much steeper, falling away to the east, 
from where occasional drafts of air carry in the faint smell of 
old wood-smoke. The grey stone walls are rough, yet the lengthy 
passages leading from them are smooth-floored, which might make 
footing difficult save for the small tunnels bored into its 
surface by the now-dead roots which once filled them, which have 
left tunnels likewise in the ceiling.

A Wide Tunnel Winding Through the Caverns~
   Here, the dark tunnel retains its great size and height as it 
curves from the intersection to the north around to the east, a 
gradual decline following it. The floor is smooth, yet hollow, 
brittle tendrils of dead roots spread across it, breaking with a 
crunch and dissolving into dust when stepped upon; the walls less 
jagged than those of much of the caverns, though they still bear 
patches of the dead bushes, lined still with iron thorns, which 
once grew throughout the caves. The air here is damp and 
slightly musty, with the dead roots more common in a few places 
in which water has pooled.

A Winding Tunnel in the Caverns~
   This wide, curving tunnel narrows suddenly to the north, but 
is otherwise quite spacious; nonetheless, care must be taken when 
passing along it to avoid the remnants of iron thorn-bushes which 
line the walls, from cracks in the rocks; touching these 
sometimes causes the dead foliage to break away, revealing, 
beneath, hollow black roots, the same as those that spread across 
the floor and delve down into the stone. Dead now, touching 
these cracks, and the fragments left behind might soon crumble 
into dust. While overall the passage slopes down to the north 
and up as it curves west, it dips slightly here, and the 
passageway is dank and somewhat musty, water pooled in a few 
places along the floor. Along the southern wall, a series of 
carvings have been made, but even now they appear quite ancient, 
as only parts of them remain intact, the original subject long 
since gone: the head of a stag visible in one place, and a man's 
body, cleft by a sword, in another, while a strange, 
empty-featured, and indistinct being has been carved elsewhere 
amidst the other oddities; oddly, there are no signs that the 
thorn-bushes ever grew about these.

A High-roofed, Narrow Tunnel~
   The tunnel narrows to a choke-point here, further narrowed by 
the few thorns, miniature daggers branching off their metallic 
structure, that still grow over the walls; even then, such an 
endeavour is unlikely to meet with success if the person is of 
noticeably greater than usual width. However, the narrowness is 
not maintained for long, and it flares out both to the north and 
to the south, in which direction it slopes gently upwards. The 
scent of old smoke is just barely detectable, wafting in from the 
north. The water-worn passageway makes up for the narrowness 
with a greater height, and the roof of the tunnel here is high 
above the smooth floor, still bearing wide, dead black roots; 
across the floor, smaller tendrils, likewise brittle and prone to 
breaking at the lightest touch, have spread out, resting in the 
dank water which sits beneath them or winding into the stone 
beneath.

A Three-way Juncture in the Tunnels~
   Here, the stone-walled tunnel comes to a three-way juncture, 
one tunnel sloping gently downwards as it moves from south to 
north, while, to the west, another passageway ascends more 
suddenly, wider than the narrow tunnel to the south, but not 
quite so high; the walls still bear the scratches left by the 
thorn-bushes, but the foliage itself has been cleared away. 
Directly to the east of the meeting of tunnels, a pipe, worn by 
time and now clogged by earth and stone, protrudes from the stone 
wall of the cavern, no doubt unable to fulfil whatever original 
purpose led to its construction. A faint, lingering scent of 
smoke drifts in from the north, accompanying occasional drafts of 
air from that direction. The floor has been cleared here, 
revealing a series of tiny tunnels, the largest the diameter of a 
finger but most much smaller, delving down into the stone.

Within a Circular, Thorn-Lined Chamber, Hewn from Rock~
   This segment of tunnel seems to run more-or-less straight from 
east to west, sloping gently downwards as it progresses in that 
direction. There, the tunnel is blocked by a pile of rubble 
which has caved in from the roof, the pieces of broken rock 
interspersed with small fragments of iron thorn-bushes which 
remain lodged in place even in death. The area widens into an 
almost-circular chamber hewn roughly from the rock. A ring of 
stones has been built in the room's centre, a jagged crack above 
them letting in a crack of light and occasional gusts of fresh 
air. The scent of smoke lingers in the area, a large pile of 
ash, mixed with twisted scraps of metal, stone, and other debris, 
remaining in the stone circle, now cold and devoid of signs of 
life; two bronze lanterns sit opposite one another in the north 
and south rock-faces. In the northern wall, several cracks run 
throughout the wall, two massive blocks of stone, surrounded by 
rubble, having broken off from the rest of the wall, their weight 
likely to keep them in place in spite of the greatest of efforts. 
Delving down into the floor are many tiny holes; within them, in 
some cases, linger hollow, black husks of dead roots.

A Sloping Tunnel in the Caverns~
   The tunnel here bends from northwest to south, sloping up in 
the latter direction. The floor seems smooth at first glance, 
but closer inspection would reveal a multitude of tiny tunnels 
scattered across it, some bearing the dried, hollow husks of dead 
black roots. Though a few round pebbles still remain, the 
majority of the rubble has been cleared. The scent of old 
wood-smoke lingers in the air, though, as one turns along the 
bend to the west, it grows stronger.

A Large Office Set Before A Garden~
   Continuing the theme from the entranceway, the painted walls 
of this large room are covered with more tapestries, paintings, 
and trophies on the north and south walls. A particularly stark 
canvas as tall and wide as a man of Nurn shows a great black 
stallion at full gallop across an inland ocean's shoreline. This 
room is clearly an office of sorts; a large desk dominates the 
northwest corner, although the lack of windows on the western 
wall is compensated by lamps set above luxurious armchairs. Two 
wide windows have been polished and cleaned regularly by the 
servants who attend to the Priest-Lord, granting a view through 
them of a small garden set to the left of a large pool and the 
path around it leads directly onto the stone paving of Malle 
Minastir and the sight of the Pipe House beyond. 
   The office's main area for guests is taken up with a beautiful 
dark teal dining table, decorated and enscribed, with high-back 
chairs sufficient to seat six and the Lord. Silk ropes lead 
above the desk to a large petalled fan, though it is too cold 
here to see much use.

A Small Ballroom~
   Freshly-panelled maple flooring is mostly covered by a 
sprawling thin carpet that displays a panorama of an isle set 
against a sunset, the shape of a great eagle flying above barely 
discernible; the isle itself seems to rise to low mountains in 
the middle and a harbor and tower can be seen; silk thread and 
gold flake have been used in abundance to lend this floor 
tapestry greater impact. It seems the servants of this place 
dare not tread on it, for they pass along the edges of the room, 
pausing to fill the lamps, or ensure the platters of fruit and 
meats are fresh. Large enough for a score of people to meander 
socially, the ballroom makes careful use of its limited space, 
built in spaces within the walls containing richly stained racks 
for wine and liqeurs, while extending shelves along each wall 
carry the sustenance guests expect. Opulent goblets and 
beautiful glasses are set for use alongside delicate plates and 
silver platters. A single raised stone platform has been 
carpeted and offers space for a few muscians if required, or for 
the Priest-Lord to address his guests. 
   A fireplace is permanently lit, set alongside a single wide 
window staring eastwards across the pool fed from the Falls of 
Sorontil beyond the Pipe House. The occasional pedestrian walks 
along Malle Minastir beyond the gardens and pool. beside the 
fireplace is a small, heavy door that blends with the panelling 
of the room, which usually remains closed.

On Malle Minastir Between the Pipe House and Manse Gardens~
   The stone paving here offers a narrow passage between a deep 
pool on the west side and the impressive sight of the Pipe House 
to the east. Fed through pipes from the Falls of Sorontil that 
smash into the building and causes the ground here to 
reverberate, water channeled through stone funnels keep the 
garden surrounding the pool as vibrant as can be expected; after 
so much time it has became overgrown and abandoned, with slaves 
still working to clear great black thorn bushes and climbing ivy 
that has clung to every stone bench here. The pool seems deep 
and wide, but is clogged up with pond grass, lily pads and 
debris. From the path, it is a simple step to the garden. 
   The Pipe House entrance is through a simple stone arch and 
even from here, copper pipes can be seen as well as spray from 
the waterfall covering everything. One central pipe filters into 
a series of brass cog mechanisms that turn exactly on the hour; 
mechanisms then trigger the sounding of a brass bell, itself 
positioned at the front of the Pipe House above the entrance. 
   Tall and grim, pale dark-cloaked guards keep constant silent 
watch on this place from just outside the entrance as the spray 
from the waterfall covers the interior and dribbles away into 
drains and back into to the pipes below to feed the gardens and 
pool outside.

The Pipe House~
   Though narrow and long, the Pipe House is nonetheless an 
impressive sight, looking from the small access area just inside 
the an open stone arch to a complex series of large copper pipes 
that flow out in all directions towards the Spire. Directly 
under the Falls of Sorontil, the constant thundering deafens any 
who stay here long as an enormous volume of water presses into a 
huge trough here that spans the width of the plummet and channels 
it out through pipes to the rest of the fortress below. One 
central pipe filters into a series of brass cog mechanisms. The 
Pipe House relies on the downward sloping nature of the fortress. 
Gravity and the force of the waterfall pour water through the 
decline in terrain all the way under the Herdstalls and offer 
taps along the way for filling buckets and troughs and the like. 
After passing through the Grist Mill and flowing into the 
Foundry, the pipes then press on to irrigate the small series of 
field systems near the entrance to the Spire. Large pipes have 
also been set flowing water north and south from the Pipe House, 
then turning to enter the fortresses as they descend, finally 
reaching the Pits and emptying out through drains into the Spire 
exterior.

Seam of Nurn's Backroom~
   Austerely decorated, this room is nonetheless well-kept and
lit by lamps hanging from the walls. The walls are stone, smooth
to the touch, with a floor of clean-hewn rock. Benchs have been
carved along the eastern wall. Shelves line the walls in places
and a workbench has been built into the western wall.

A Turning at the Northern Corner of the Pipe House~
   Malle Minastir widens northwards as the rear end of the canyon 
rises steeply overhead with a jutting overhanging rock protrusion 
directly above the area north of the Pipe House. Lamps are 
almost constantly lit here, as if to fight off the darkness 
threatening above to reclaim the garrison. The presence of tall, 
well-equipped guards wandering past the large stone dwellings to 
the north puts off the casual wanderer on the whole. Southwards 
the astounding view of the waterfall and the building set below 
it beckons; some remnants of a garden and pool can be seen at the 
back of the Manse. The noise of water flowing through pipes and 
heading off north and west is very prominent here. The fence 
that surrounds the buildings proceeds towards a guarded gate. 

Nestled along the Pipe House, with a pair of lamps hanging at its 
beaded-curtain entrance, is a two-storied, dark-shuttered 
building.

Malle Nisimaldar Meets Malle Entulesse~
   This is one of the busiest parts of Romenna, the Middle Tier. 
Wagons laden with goods and supplies pass north towards the 
granary or turn right to visit the many shops, or of course 
continue eastwards up to the top tier via the ramp alongside the 
stone steps. Visitors, merchants and those who dwell here walk 
quietly on the whole between the constant guard presence and go 
about their business. There is little laughter in this place, 
though the avenue of Malle Nisimaldar to the west is lined with 
large potted trees on the way to the gatehouses. White-stoned 
fountains can be seen in the other directions some short distance 
away. Occasionally a horseman will ride through, trotting their 
steed carefully over the stone slabs, either heading out or 
towards the stables at the northwestern corner of this tier. 
While busy at most times of the day, at night few are out, save 
the hooded guards standing tall and silent against the constant 
chill of this place. High above the tilting canyon walls, a view 
of the sky is gifted to any pausing long enough to look up, 
should the weather allow it. At night the tended lamps tend to 
close out any view of stars, this in itself somehow oppressive.

Silver-Birch-Lined Avenue of Malle Nisimaldar ~
   From the western gatehouses straight and true to the ramp up 
to Armenelos, this well-maintained road stretches eastwards on 
either side of the rear of many small dwellings and shops. Far 
wider than other paths in this place, clearly this avenue was 
designed long ago to offer passing room to troops, wagons and 
riders. With skilled and canny construction ability, the 
founders of this fortress took pains to ensure that uncovered 
stone troughs were lain to the north and south of a stretch of 
enclosed earth, feeding the trees that never grew there through 
rivulets cut into the stone and decorated with leaping salmon, 
now faded, the artisan long dead and forgotten. The sound of 
flowing water underfoot is a constant reminder of the Falls of 
Sorontil above to the east where the Pipe House captures the 
water to power the Spire. 
   Where the avenue of trees were dreamed of long ago, in their 
place the Lord of the garrison has imported young potted silver 
birch. They line the long stretch of the road here, all the way 
up to the large gate and stopping just before Malle Entulesse. 
The pale bark and peeling dark patches do nothing to offer cheer, 
though the mass of triangular leaves splaying out along the many 
smaller branches rustle in the constant breezes and gales here.

Between the Gatehouses~
   Large strapped gates block the way out of Romenna as well as 
further into it. Two gatehouses rise on either side of the 
widened packed dirt square and guards are a constant presence 
here, standing tall with long cloaks and steel-tipped spears, 
staring at all who pass and stopping any they wish to search or 
turn back. Wagons, carts, merchants, travellers and dwellers of 
this place pass to and fro, with the gates constantly being 
opened and then sealed once more. A small door-sized hatch set 
in each gate is normally used for the passage of people and 
blackbloods. Above, a simple flat stone ceiling offers a series 
of holes and funnels for archers and oil. When the days are even 
colder than normal here a brazier is set alight and soldiers 
gather about it, hawkers and travellers sharing stories and news.

On Malle Entulesse North of the Ramp~
   This path of carefully squared pale granite blocks passes 
housing and the turning west down Malle Sakalthor. A high stone 
wall packed with mortar holds the upper tier in place to the 
east, rising to the height of the roof of most dwellings here. A 
fountain of pale white stone is visible to the north, spraying 
water upwards. Beyond it the damaged Lodge is visible, built 
into the side of the canyon. Northwest, the east side of the 
raised Granary is visible. The ramp up to Armenelos to the south 
is a short distance away. Orb-like lamps hang off iron posts 
here, the Lampwright occasionally spotted filling and lighting 
them. Northwards, towards the fountains, it is common to hear 
the constant ringing of small bells.

The Fountain of Bells At An Intersection of Paths~
   With roads stretching off in all directions except where 
blocked by the high eastern wall, this was originally seen as the 
perfect place for a fountain to show off the power of the 
waterfall and skills of the long-dead sculptors. The damaged 
Lodge and the rest of the Reflected Moon complex are nearby to 
the northwest, while the Granary stands on its stone pillars to 
the north and the Bathhouse stands further away westwards across 
the Nisinen Gardens.

Before the Granary on Malle Atanamir~
   Set against the northern cliffs, a large stone warehouses has 
been raised above the ground level with great octagonal pillars. 
Numenor ingenuity ensures that the rats are kept away by the 
raised pillars and the pipes that come from above are 
deliberately kept well away from the structure to avoid any leak 
or flooding damage. Built entirely of stone, no wood or 
flammable materials are allowed inside. The Granary contains 
multiple large silos cut out of the stone and is inaccessible by 
any but the Silo Merchants. These merchants are permanently 
available in a small office set before the Granary and report on 
the fullness or otherwise of the silos. If there is room, they 
will pay well for grain products. As time goes on the supplies 
dwindle and should they ever empty entirely, the Spire will have 
to be abandoned. The Silo Merchants pay reasonably well for 
sacks of grain of all sorts but allow none to enter. 
   On the other side of the lamp-lit roadway sits a dwelling 
converted into a small green grocer. Crates of vegetables and 
fruit sit propped up for a better view, some tied together ready 
for delivery to elsewhere in the garrison. It is not unusual to 
see the Lodge servants sprint here at all times of day and night 
to fetch back boxes of grocer goods fit for the Haradrim 
appetites.

A Turn in Malle Nunduine Before the Bathhouse~
   As the stone-set path continues northwards towards a modest 
park and the Reflected Moon halls and Lodge, eastwards it passes 
the backs of dwellings and shops. Water under high pressure can 
be felt and heard beneath the roadway and seems to head directly 
into the bathhouse to the west. That building is taller than 
most dwellings, capped by a gently sloping peaked roof with the 
darkened statue of a dancer, her hands scooping up the many 
layers of her dress as she spirals. Two thin pillars bear the 
weight of a whitened marbled block that clearly was meant to be 
enscribed, but those who built it left too quickly to complete 
their work. Between the columns, the entrance to the bathhouse 
is carefully guarded and the wooden doors kept closed whenever 
possible. Several smaller doors offer private access down small 
fenced-off steps, suggesting a basement level under most of the 
dwellings here.

Nisinen Gardens~
   Recent planting of trees make use of the channels of water 
ever available, with rich loam shipped from Nurn itself used here 
at the Nsinen Gardens. Sweet-smelling shrubs and flowers used 
more to growing alongside riverbanks have been set amongst small 
pools and rock formations. Of reasonable size, these gardens are 
a sensible use of the overflow from the main pipe, but also offer 
a rare area of solace and beauty for those who appreciate such 
things. One side of the Gardens is set aside for planting of 
vegetables and herbs. The Plantsman is paid to tend to these and 
every tree and bush and weed in all three of the tiers, including 
the Manse. It has been made clear to all that the Plantsman will

the Priest-Lord's wife. 
   A short trail leads north-south between two iron archway, 
while to the west the gardens stretch on. Eastwards piles of 
dead brambles and heaped soil show that there is much still to do 
here, or much is being done.

Western End of Nisinen Gardens~
   A gentle lamplit path meanders towards a stone wall set in the 
western sweep of the middle tier's boundaries, that has been set 
with a low gate, easily pushed to and fro, a small circular 
promontory apparent beyond it. Eastwards the main north-south 
pathway leads to the Bathhouse or the Reflected Moon Lodge and 
Halls. The gardens here show some progress, with tilled rich 
loam marking out bare plots of land. Pots containing hardy 
saplings are tented under awnings and slaves potter about here, 
most seeming more than content to be here than forced into labor 
elsewhere in the Garrison.

Before the Lodge and Reflected Moon Halls~
   In this shaded area, it was thought best to construct a large 
two-floor lodge from broad slabs of granite. Impressive in its 
ambition, three high arching triangular roof gables stare ahead 
through the high, wide windows above a generous-sized entranceway 
and oaken door. Passing beneath the jutting fragment of the dark 
mountain at this end of the ravine, a dark pressure leans upon 
the stone path, reinforced by sight of a climbing pile of 
vertical slats of broken cliff-side that have slipped down and 
collapsed upon the rear of the roof of the Lodge, breaking its 
back. Not much else can be seen from here, but water trickles 
down amongst the great fingers of rock that now sit upon the 
structure. 
   Within the Lodge, access is granted to the Immortals barracks 
and the Hall of Shades of the Reflected Moon; it is common to see 
dusty-garmented soldiers, well-dressed swarthy merchants and 
collared common slaves making their ways to and fro. The hooded 
lamps set on tall poles here are kept lit in the night hours by 
the Lampwright and servants regularly to cast a dim lighting over 
the area. Banners hang on either side of each buildings doorway, 
decorated with the vivid insignia and emblems of the Reflected 
Moon.

A Large Stone-Built Stable~
   Once a store of equipment and supplies, this large stone 
warehouse has been converted into stables; motes of straw and hay 
dust hang in the air of this stable, and the pungent smell of 
horses vies with the sweat of the slaves who work here. Wide 
doors of dark lumber swing outwards often to grant passage in or 
away to other parts of the Spire and beyond. There is an open 
area, where some carts and wagons are stored and repaired, along 
with various items of harness and horse tack. Beyond this is a 
tidy line of horse stalls. The senior ostler busies themself 
here, calling out orders and relaxing to the rhythmic sound of 
horse-grooming, or the jingle of harness being polished. The 
lack of windows or much light beneath the canyon wall is offset 
by large glass-covered lamps set within upward iron claws mounted 
along the sides of the walls. Buckets of water are set next to 
an entire section of copper pipe that winds about the building at 
chest level. 
   Clearly military stables, guards stand in each corner and a 
broad set of steps are set at the rear of part of the conversion, 
leading to a raised oak door. Soldiers of the Priest-Lord come 
to and fro through that, often setting off to ride away at speed, 
or return with a horse that is led away exhausted.

Semi-Circular Walled Promontory Overlooking Noirinan~
   Through a low gate that swings with a stiff creak in high 
winds, this exposed half-circle of rock has been set with cracked 
sections of flat pale stone, forming a random pattern of roughly 
triangular shapes that are bordered by a waist-high stone wall, 
with a widened top shelf smoothed atop it. Stepping out to view 
the ravine, the scale of the place becomes apparent amidst the 
overpowering mountain walls to the north and south, which lean in 
as if to fall and crush this place. Westwards, figures are seen 
day and night moving amongst the market stalls and upper walls of 
Noirinan, the Valley of the Tombs. Directly below, the larger 
northern building set at the level of the ravine floor can be 
seen, with the Wainway west of that. Pooling water sits all 
about the descending rocks. The Herdstalls stand out day or 
night as the constant lights of the lamps along Malle Adunakhor 
lead travellers, merchants, wains and soldiers between the gates 
of the final wall and the sloping ramp down to the Mordor Gate 
and eastwards under the mountains to reach the Morgai. 
   Constantly windy, nevertheless the crescent benches set here 
prove popular with some. Patrols of guards do not reach this far 
and it is a rare spot for privacy.

North of the Spire Fountain Along Malle Atanamir~
   Flanked by the southern wall of the Reflected Moon barracks 
and the western sparse vegetation and growth of the Gardens, the 
slabbed path heads away from the mountain wall towards a fountain 
that seems to sound tiny bells even from here. Eastwards small 
dwellings have been converted to shops on the righthand side, 
judging by the signs hanging above their doors. The ravine wall 
here towers overhead as it leans inwards gradually, casting a 
dark shadow during the day. The orbed lamps are kept permanently 
lit here. The water that pours down the rocky striations from 
above is collected in various channels above pipes that flow 
water westwards towards the towers that protect the approach. A 
huge risen structure to the northeast is clearly the Granary.

Malle Atanamir Before the Granary~
   The great pillars that the Granary squats upon are visible all 
the way along the stone path on the northern side. The scale of 
the achievement is staggering; each pillar was clearly fashioned 
individually and set with the care and accuracy many now would 
not dare attempt, while the stone structure above it shows not a 
single crack or sign of damage from the eternity it has sat here 
alone and uncared for until recently. There are downward-curving 
open pipes above, with grilles barely visible; though their 
purpose is unclear the local bird population has marked them with 
nests and at certain times of year the sound of birdsong trills 
out from above. 
   The drab stone path continues east and west, obscured from any 
natural light or glimpse of the stars by great dark fingers of 
rock above. On the other side of the roadway sacks of sugar and 
tea leaves are stacked near the door and a sign above shows a 
peppermill. A newly constructed warehouse can also be seen 
standing to the north.

A Purveyor's Storefront~
   Some attempt has been made to keep an area wide enough to walk 
amongst the crates, sacks, boxes and jars piled on tables, under 
them, overhead hanging from hooks, piled onto shelves, or resting 
against corners of the shop. Dry goods are everywhere and spill 
over onto every available surface. Spices, pepper, sugar, tea 
and all manner of supplies are available, along with the 
resulting overwhelming aroma. Much here has been labelled as 
sold already, awaiting slaves to collect it. Tall glass jars 
protect large lanterns that illuminate the store against the 
gloom.

Malle Nundulne Between Buildings And Nisinen Gardens~
   Looking up from here across the mostly bare Nisinen Gardens, a 
great jutting section of rock sits far above; the Spire Keep is 
set behind this promontory and wide steps lead down in sections 
and resting points stretching westwards to disappear from sight 
somewhere outside the tiers. At the southern edge of the stone 
path a row of buildings present drab grey walls, while eastwards 
the sounds of bells tinkle in the air. The borders of the 
Gardens are carefully raked and turned, but little planting has 
yet been achieved. A shot iron fence has been recently installed 
to invite passage into the gardens further to the west of under a 
small archway.

Malle Abattarik Meets Malle Entulesse~
   While the eastern wall of the top tier of this place rises up 
forlornly to the east, its slabs of rocks smoothed and gaps 
filled to prevent attempts at climbing, the walls of a plain 
building above rise even higher with several small windows 
peering down. Far quieter than the intersection north of here, 
there are still a small number of people who travel the stone 
paths west and south, many laden with goods they have purchased 
from the many businesses clinging onto life here as the ravine 
narrows and leans overhead. 
   A fountain sits here, cracked and useless, a small pool of 
wretched stagant water and drowned rats doing nothing to improve 
the ambience of the place. Once it must have been a white-stoned 
circular basin with a tall statue of a horse rearing, but that is 
now in pieces within the fountain, a large section of broken rock 
from the cliffs above sitting in its midst. Clearly the 
Mountains of Shadow disapproved.

Malle Abattarik Nearing A Shattered Fountain~
   A steady stream of Reflected Moon Haradrim pass along the 
intersection to the east, while here a more diverse crowd tend to 
head westwards empty-handed, returning this way laden with goods 
or cursing with disappointment. Some emerge from the northern 
shop holding bottles and ointments, or from the south lighting 
freshly purchased pipes or rolling themselves westmanweed to fire 
up. Above, sight of the sky begins to diminish as the edge of 
the ravine is neared southwards.

Within A Small Chamber Off The Main Library~
   Backing onto the Library, this small chamber has been carved 
out of the canyon as the northern wall is still bare rock, clammy 
and cold to the touch with pale striations running down its 
surface. A small doorway leads to another room to the south. 
Carved into the eastern smoothed rock surface is a large sigil of 
a white tree, stars above its boughs. Clearly an office, a desk, 
table and piles of parchments are arranged carefully here.

Malle Zimrathon Meets Malle Entulesse~
   Nearing the stables to the west and Library to the east, it is 
normal to see dark-skinned soldiers and richly-dressed merchants 
here, under the darkening rockface that stretches up and blots 
out all light. The orbed lamps here are maintained by the 
Lampwright and their servants dutifully, lest it fall into 
shadow. An eerie glow is cast on the southern dwellings that 
seem deserted and stretch in either direction. To the north a 
broken fountain can be seen, while to the east an impressive 
marbled building boasts a statue stood in front of it. 
   A grim windowless stone building to the south with a barred 
door has hooks set into the wall, many holding the heads of those 
who have broken the laws here. Within no doubt, is a place many 
here will not wish to ever see.

Western Malle Zimrathon Before Stables~
   The hooded lamps set on tall poles here are kept lit in the 
night hours by the Lampwright and servants regularly to cast a 
dim lighting over the area. Most activity though is to the west 
where a large slab-walled warehouse has been converted to a 
stable, large double-doors of a stained lumber often pushed open 
from inside and held in place while the gusts of winds gale down 
the roadway. A heavy scent of horse manure hangs here even in 
the fiercest of storms and slaves go to and fro often with 
shovels, sacks and bowed backs, quietly heading between the 
stables and the Nisinen Gardens where they store the future 
fertiliser. A southern smaller warehouse has been converted into 
a glassworks, if the quantity of small panes and colored stained 
panels leaning outside are any clue.

Eastern Malle Zimrathon Before The Library~
   A statue stands before an arched building built into the 
cliffs, the figure of a man holding an open tome and quill. Four 
edged pillars have been cut out of the dark rock and between the 
middle pair a tall white rock arch spans them at a height of 
twice that of a Harad warrior. The hollow underneath this leads 
into a dimly lit hall, glimpses of smaller statues and long 
tables caught from outside. 
   The ravine presses in on the south side, with a high stone 
wall smoothly carved and set in places by large blocks of rock, 
rising to the upper tier. Westwards the stone path leads to a 
junction that seems more popular than this place to the 
inhabitants.

   Contained in a small room, this infirmary boasts of smooth, 
whitewashed walls, a cold stone floor, and efficient storage 
space. A small work table lies against one wall, decorated with 
a plethora of small cubbies and small drawers. A plain table 
lies within the center of the room, covered only with a thin 
mattress and a clean sheet, made for the sole purpose of 
examination. Another corner bears a narrow table with a small 
wash basin at the ready. 
   A thin cloth curtain hangs in the doorway, serving as a poor

A Large Dimly-Lit Lounge~
   Sweet smelling smoke curls near the ceiling of this spacious 
lounge, drifting about from the few patrons mingling about the 
establishment. A wood-framed painting, depicting a sand storm 
beating its way towards a lavish walled city in many vibrant 
bright colours, is hung upon one of the walls, cushioned booths 
arranged underneath for seating. There is small bunched crowd of 
men, dour and mostly dark-skinned, who all surround about 
fabric-topped tables taking risks at games of chance. One of the 
lounges corners has been roped off into a ring, the wood-plank 
floor worn with nicks and scars in places, bearing a few splotchy 
blood stains. The walls here have a darker wash to them than the 
main Lodge bar, lending to a darker and cooler atmosphere. There 
are fewer slaves and servants loitering about in the lounge, and 
those that do move about do so in an efficient and quiet 
obedience. Brightly-coloured pillows have been bunched and 
arranged about low tables, roughly circling one larger hardwood 
table where beautiful slave girls can be seen dancing throughout 
the day and night. Occasionally, cursing and cheering can be 
heard from the gaming tables, above the mostly serious and quiet 
conversation.

Quarters For The Reflected Moon Shades Officers~
   These medium-sized rectangular quarters are comfortable, being 
occupied by well-kept beds, and a finely-crafted desk with a pair 
of bronze-cast lamps affixed to the wall above its broad surface. 
Dark-stone walls rise to a high ceiling, all of it kept perfectly 
clean, with a brightly woven tapestry hung over each bed, one of 
a sunset and the other of a still star ridden sunrise. The 
flagstone floor has been lushly carpeted by a large area rug. 
Thin drapes hang on the northern wall, crimson edged in black, 
obscuring a long and narrow shaped iron-barred window. Twin 
banners, bearing the emblem of the Reflected Moon hang off the 
southern wall, on either side of the desk, carefully arranged out 
of the way of the bronze lamps. Notably, the ceiling off this 
quarters has been washed a black hue, with the western door 
carved with the imagery of the Reflected Moon clan.

The Atanamir Green Grocer~
   Unlike the Purveyors of dry goods next door, this shop is a 
bright surprise of colorful fruits and vegetables, sold off to 
patrons by an exuberant and cheerful family loyal to the 
Reflected Moon, who welcome barter and the opportunity to spend 
hours of anyone's day gossipping harmlessly. Calling out to 
visitors of the boldly low prices and the difficulties of finding 
fresh green groceries so far from home, the family deal in a 
brisk trade with good humour. Crates and boxes of tomatoes, 
apples, oranges, lemons and anything that the wains from the 
Harad camp in the Udun plains can manage to fetch this far are 
quickly bought up by those here with coin and a reputation. What 
is left is put on offer, the shortages made up by the cheer 
offered.

The End of Malle Atanamir~
   If anything, the reminder of the power of the mountains is 
even more real with a bulge of rock directly above the end of the 
stone-slabbed path. All is dark here, though the frequest visits 
of the Lampwright ensure the orbs glow ever brighter against 
that. The eastern section of the ravine rises up from here 
vertically and large cracks, jagged and narrow, are home to ferns 
and moss and even fungii. To the south the soft glow of lamps 
illuminate those working within a windowed shopfront, hunched 
over the broken heels of shoes and clamping keys for copying. 
The Granary sits on its pillars to the north, now sheltering a 
number of colourful tents.

The Cordwainer and Cobbler of Noirinan~
   This shop seems to lend itself to a certain serenity that 
comes with artisans concentrating on their highly-skilled work. 
In this case, the converted dwelling has been split into two 
square sections with counters in between and shelves of leather 
goods, mainly shoes. The lefthand side is occupied by several 
cordwainers who work with soft leathers to produce shoes, belts 
and the like. The opposite area of the shop contains a cobbler 
who doubles as a locksmith, reparing shoes and sandals as well as 
clamping keys to the bench and copying them expertly. Clearly 
proud of their skills, the service from those who work here is 
quietly assured.

vstr The Locksmith in this room can copy any key for you for a fair price of 20 coins. To order a copy, simply do COPY <KEY> with the key in your hand. Providing that the object really is a key and that you have enough coin, you will be given a ticket. After a set period of time (a little less than an IG week, usually), the Locksmith will give the key copy to anyone bringing him the ticket and issuing a command REDEEM KEY with the ticket in hand. Therefore, it would be wise not to lose your ticket!

Smoking Den of the Reflected Moon~
   This large room is rectangular in shape made of white stone 
walls with the floor bearing large light sandstone tiles, each 
streaked with spidery thin vines of more darker earthy tones. 
The spicy scent of smokeleaf hangs as a thick haze in the air 
mixed with the many aroma's ranging from various ales to spiced 
foods, from incense to perfumes and khaskkhas; even the subtle 
smell of sweat. Slaves and servants generally bearing olive and 
swarthy complexions move too and fro at all hours tending to 
patrons and ensuring the exchange of coin for smokes, drinks and 
food is ever ongoing. While some parts of the den appear to be 
purposefully dark, dimly lit by well placed candles the main 
source of illumination comes from the fireplace can be seen 
neatly set in one corner apparently matched by a drinking 
fountain set into the other. Two silver chandeliers hang also 
hang from the ceiling offering light. There are two doors in 
this room, a heavy, carved wooden door to the north that leads 
further in to the Lodge, and wooden door to the south, which 
leads outside of the Lodge. 
   A small OOC #4sign#0 is here.

The Immortals Training Hall~
   Cool white stone walls make this spacious hall which is 
supported by wide stone pillars holding the ceiling in place from 
which hangs three large silver chandeliers. No curtains hang 
here, instead various ornamental scimitars, spears, shields and 
axes line the walls indicating this area to be more austere and 
spartan than the other halls. A large black lies in the center 
of the room while practice weapons wait readily available from 
weapon racks set neatly against the wall. The room is full of 
movement at all hours while the famed Immortals bearing generally 
olive and swarthy complexions train their minds and bodies in the 
ways of battle. To the east curtains separate this room from the 
next while a sturdy reinforced doors leads away to the north and 
the west and a spiraling stairwell ascends above. A stone 
archway leads to a landing to the west.

A Stone-Walled Armoury~
   In contrast to the decorum and design of the main barracks, 
this is a small and very plain chamber set with heavy off-white
stone blocks. Arranged as an armoury, wooden shelves line the 
walls, with space for storage on the floor. The door leading 
out of the armoury has thick bands of iron wrapped around it,
also bearing a secure lock. Otherwise, this storage chamber is 
left rather unremarkable in construction and decoration, save
for a single Reflected Moon banner that hangs limply from a
wall.

A Large Officers Meeting Chamber~
   An array of dark pillar candles scattered throughout the 
chamber bathe this oval shaped room in an dim glow. Silken 
curtains of midnight black and bright white drape down the walls 
whilst a large spiralling patterned rug has been laid across the 
notably fine lavish floors of black marble, each streaked with 
bright white veins. A large fireplace has been built into one 
side of the room while large sturdy reinforced doors can be seen 
to both the east and west. A spiralling stairwell weaves its way 
down to the ground floor below.

Quarters To The Reflected Moon Immortals~
   This large rectangular quarters is orderly and is occupied by 
a line of beds, with bronze lamps affixed to the wall. Off-white 
stone walls rise to a high ceiling, all of it kept perfectly 
clean. The flagstone floor has been carpeted by a large, 
tightly-woven rug. Simple and carefully arranged, the room has 
no frills, being obviously a military domain. Drapes hang on the 
walls, pale yellow edged in red, obscuring two small, iron barred 
windows in the southern wall. Twin long banners of the Reflected 
Moon hang off the northern wall. Notably, the ceiling has been 
painted with the emblem of the Reflected Moon.

Along Malle Abattarik~
   An extremely popular southern doorway is constantly filtering 
warriors of the Reflected Moon and others, some emerging proudly 
with blades they hold up to admire and show their comrades. A 
sign hanging from the northern building shows a simple ceramic 
pot and indeed large glazed pots sit on either side of the 
doorway. A shallow indent running some of the length of the path 
here seems to reveal a collapsed pipe.

Malle Abattarik Passing Shops~
   Great slabs of meat hang out in the cold air alongside the 
northern building, while uptilted trays display cuts of pork and 
beef. Despite the attention of slaves, insects constantly buzz 
about the butchershop and are swatted away. The southern 
building is quieter and darker as the rocks above lean to block 
out most of the natural light or sight of the sky. Thick rolls 
of material and thread are set out for customers to handle and 
choose from. Malle Abattarik continues on in both directions, 
the stone slabs being scrubbed by slaves from time to time.

Halfway Along Malle Abattarik~
   Groups of Harad warriors mill about the northern building, 
conversing loudly as they stare over the armor set inside the 
shopfront they point at through the windows. A far different set 
of clientele speak quietly outside the opposite building, most 
richly garbed and disdainful of the warriors. Careful polished 
glass reveals the sight of rich gems and jewels within. 
Meanwhile, the stone slabs of this roadway are cracked in places 
and a broken pipe from somewhere beneath leaks out a slowly 
congealing pool of water alongside the armorers.

Nearing the Western Wall Along Malle Abattarik~
   The narrow pathway here leads westwards towards the southern 
edge of a tall gatehouse and a promontory through a low gate. 
Eastwards the road continues past shops and merchants, even the 
most colourful and exuberant of them diminished by the 
encroaching dark rock above. The sweet scents of a bakery from 
the north are all the more appealing when the loaves and buns set 
out through the small windows are seen. The southern shop lets 
out its own aroma, sacks of herbs and spices piled besides the 
doorway.

The Saffron Pomander~
   Wooden panels of cedar and a pinewood floor give this shop a 
rustic appearance. The spices, dried fruits and herbs of this 
converted shopfront are displayed in a haphazard fashion: hung 
from fake wooden beams by brass hooks, cast into wicker baskets 
or scattered into straw bowls. A single hooded lantern provides 
the whole of the shop's illumination further complementing the 
rustic and rural feel of the place. The shop is very quiet, few 
people come and go and those that do seem to leave with very 
small packages, wrapped carefully. Clearly expensively repaired, 
this place is watched over by richly-scented servants.

The Bakehouse~
   This spacious shopfront is the front of a large stone 
building. Its floor is made of tightly-fitted pale tiles, with 
no carpet or rugs. The cream-painted walls lead up to a bare 
stone ceiling. Aisles of baked goods are set along the edges of 
the shop, with a main counter against the east wall where 
purchases may be made. People seem to be here at all hours, 
though at night the crowd is minimal. The air smells always of 
fresh bread. 
   A white-painted door is set to the south.

The Library of Noirinan~
   Inside this small hall hollowed from the ravine itself, a tall 
series of shelves are mostly bare and the stone tables are 
scratched and barren. Dust collects amongst the many smaller 
statues within, though they are unscathed and whole. One small 
room for the Librarian sits at the rear on the single floor of 
this long abandoned place, recently reclaimed. Its new use is as 
a clerical building for the Lord, storing claims, ownership and 
knowledge. A few servants keep this place clean and ensure that 
the few scrolls and books here remain where they should be. 
   Through an open passage between large white columns, to the 
west can be seen a portion of a statue and a dimly lit pathway 
beyond.

Cramped Stone Living Quarters~
   The chill of the rocks and the press of the cliffs above grant 
this small bed chamber a claustrophic and lonely grace. While 
there is certainly enough room for the bed and desk here, the 
remaining space is taken with some furniture and a small 
fireplace with a chimney flute that seems to rise up at a slight 
angle and presumably emerges at the top of the library. A gap in 
the western wall leads to a small storeroom for the Library.

The Ramped Approach to Romenna~
   Looking down from the two Gatehouses, the ramp descends at a 
fairly steep angle directly towards Malle Adunakhor and offers 
access to wagons as well as horsemen and those who dwell above. 
The descent to the Morgai Tunnel can be seen clearly just west of 
the ramp and leads into a slowly climbing dark passage, 
well-guarded and heavily-gated. It is through this tunnel that 
the wagons, wains, travellers and warbands journey. Westwards 
the way leads to Mittalmar, where the livestock and herds are 
kept, as well as the slaves. Great heaps of ruined stone and 
detritus are piled up off the trails.

Approaching Romenna And A Tunnel Below~
   When staring from the ground level, two small stone structures 
rise a single story on either side of the wide ramp ahead. Once 
small guardhouses and military offices, they are now part of the 
Balchoth dominion who do with them as they please. The larger 
two story white-stone barrack-keeps rise almost to the level of 
the Middle Tier, so that the two higher Gatehouses stare down 
between the gap. The ramp touches the packed rock and earth 
roadway and almost immediately a deep circular hole in the ground 
plunges down, large enough for the largest wain to pass. 
   Westwards the Market and slave pens leads between great piles 
of rubble until they reach the high final wall of the Spire 
fortress.

Along Malle Adunakhor Between Heaps of Rubble~
   Great piles of rubble rise to the south before the edge of the 
ravine's rising rock wall. Comprising broken aged glass, twisted 
iron poles pitted with rust, great blocks of stone still 
clutching decayed mortar, the odd rusted item left behind, this 
is a place for scavengers to crawl among the wreckage that once 
stood proud and new to the east within the garrison. Streams of 
grime run out of the huge mounds during heavy rain and pour into 
the long trough besides the wide roadway of packed dirt and wide 
lanterns hanging from newly-sunk poles. Slaves can be seen most 
times of day shovelling away the detritus of travellers and their 
wain-steeds. Westwards towards the remainder of the Spire 
fortress the Mittalmar marketplace surrounds the Herdstalls, 
where livestock are held safe from predators and blackblood teeth 
alike. More rubble is scattered about in mounds to the north, 
where a sunken oddly-shaped building stands besides a turning in 
the wide trail that passes it. The ramp up into the Romenna tier 
stands to the east, as does the plunging mouth of the tunnel 
leading below to the Balchoth caves and Morgai Gate. 
   The Slave Halls and Pens can be seen to the northeast.

The Bridge Before the Swill Hole~
   Lashed logs have been set into posts on either side of a wide 
open pipe, holding a reinforced oaken bridge over it. Southwards 
the wide packed earth roadway heads towards the garrison, Morgai 
tunnel and marketplace. Westwards it travels to the gate to the 
remainder of the fortress, while to the east the path travels 
onwards to a large converted guardhouse, great wooden doors 
barring entrance. 
   An odd amalgamation of materials and building remains has been 
roped and mortared together directly to the north, rather like 
one of the Abominations that dwell in the Spire Keep high above. 
A set of darkwood stable doors have been set into a stone wall 
barely large enough to act as their frame. Bulging wooden fence 
panels and palisade-spikes then prop up large thin iron panels 
and a roof consisting of broken and patchworked sections rescued 
from the rubble all about here. Twisted iron girders, great 
slabs of granite and the ingenuity of the orc have combined here 
to form the Swill Hole, the blackblood drinking den, as well as 
the only way into the Arena, where blood is spilled and coins 
exchange hands in great quantities, night and day alike.

#24203
The Grist Mill~
   From here, the pipes are set directly westwards until they 
reach the Foundry. With the drop in height from the wall to the 
middle tier, the pipe flow falls onto an overshot water wheel, 
mounted vertically and rotated by the water striking paddles set 
into the wheel and filling buckets. These buckets pull down the 
wheel and empty into the bottom trough as they rise the other 
side and the force of this drives the water west down the foundry 
pipes. It is a testament to the skill of the original builders 
that such a wheel is possible in this place. Perhaps most 
impressive of all, the middle axle is cast in steel with wedges 
for the spokes set in stone brackets. Replacing the wooden 
spokes is therefore reasonably simple and indeed it seems 
recently the entire structure has been repaired. Slaves of the 
Miller attend to the needs of the visitors here who need their 
crops ground down, or who have come to purchase the limited 
quantity available that does not go directly to the Silo 
Merchants. They visit from the Granary each day to collect the 
majority of sacks produced and transport them by wagon back up to 
the Middle Tier. Ever keen to purchase grain or flour from 
suppliers, the Miller offers a fairly decent price.

In Noirinan Passing Between Rubble~
   While the impressive rise of the garrison tiers to the east 
marks the end of the canyon, high above the treacherous steps 
lead up to the Spire Keep, figures of uruk-hai guards seen 
patrolling each of the rest points regularly. Three old bare 
stone buildings of plain white stone sit to the east at ground 
level, one larger than the others, the two smaller now the Slave 
Halls and Pen. To the west, the easy passage for a traveller is 
blocked by rising mounds of rubble and ruin, cleared here by the 
slaves used to free the garrison and this stretch of the ravine 
from the grip of ancient decay. To the south a busy widened 
roadway offers caravans sufficient breadth to travel from the 
market to the Morgai tunnel and beyond. 
   Of more humble origins, a strange construction to the north 
sees blackbloods and hardened travellers and others passing to 
and fro, occasional cries of encouragement and pain emitted from 
near it. It is beyond a bridge over a swiftly-flowing waterway.

Eastern Mittalmar~
   Tents round the Herdstalls here, simple canvas sheets nailed 
to poles and wooden slats, offering goods as they arrive from the 
east or from what can be gathered from outside the fortress. 
Those who walk here seek out goods or visit the livestock and 
horses within the Emerie segregated fenced-off areas. Chickens, 
sheep and slaves tending them can be seen, with a small herd of 
horses to their south. Eastwards, Malle Adunakhor leads to the 
garrison with a trail leading northwards to the Arena.

the Herdstalls can be seen the wild white oxen known as the Kine 
Herd of Araw, as well as simple farm livestock in a partitioned 
area to their left. The Market here is usually quiet, with those 
with coin and a wish for goods frequently cursing the 
poorly-stocked tented stalls as they leave.

North Western Mittalmar Before the Grist Mill~
   Built within the final wall between the garrison and the 
Foundry, a large vertical millwheel juts out at a decline in the 
ground level. The Grist Mill entrance is set just south of the 
gates to the side of the wheel. A great rush of water pushes 
from a wide pipe at a level bank here, plunging down to keep the 
wheel moving. To approach the Mill, a wide path has been cut 
down out of the rock and dirt, passing the very hub of the spoked 
contraption into an arched entrance in the wall.

   Here the passage of hopeful visitors presses closer as the

Above, the occasional Uruk-hai sentry peers overhead, some taking 
pot shots with their bows at passing birds or bats. Inside the 
Herdstalls just north of here great white oxen roam menacingly, 
while to the south the enormous beasts of burden with their 
single horns roam in a docile manner.

   This corner of the Market smells badly as pools of blood and 
the strained remains of slaughtered creatures dribble from the 
slaughterhouse to the east through a large grille set in the 
stony floor. Rats and other creatures mass here, feasting on the 
discards. Within the Herdstalls, enormous single-horned beasts 
wander aimlessly within iron fences, spending most of their time 
grazing on bundles of grass and hay.

Southern Mittalmar Before The Slaughterhouse~
   A great gate forms a firm barrier into the Herdstalls of 
Emerie to the north of the Market path, with many potential 
buyers surveying the beasts within at this end. To the south, a 
low building has been carved out of the mountainside and serves 
as a slaughterhouse, with wide gates to welcome beasts which 
never reappear. Entrails are scattered about and the screams of 
dying creatures escape from within.

The Swill Hole~
   This place is no simple tavern, but seems to be an 
amalgamation of discarded, ruined stone walls from the tiers to 
the east of here, old, collapsed rooftops, remains of iron 
lamp-posts, twisted, rusty poles, and panels, all patchworked 
together to form a long and careening belly of a stone and iron 
beast, impossible to walk within without knocking into a granite 
block or a pole holding up a precarious roof section. It 
slithers northward and downward, sinking gradually. Two old 
stable doors to the south offer escape from this place of stone 
tables and rescued pieces of ancient history, used now to prop up 
counters or toss at one another. Only canvas flaps protect the 
way westward into the depressed expance of the Arena, and these 
are constantly being pushed back as all races converge to fight 
there, especially when the Arena events are taking place. It is 
not possible to watch from here, but it is at least a good place 
to recover and drown in victory or defeat succour. Amongst the 
crowds of blackbloods that force thier way through here, Haradrim 
and various Easterlings mingle loudly, often including 
travellers, merchants, and waindrivers from the East.

South Eastern Mittalmar~
   Nearing the southern limits of the ravine's rising wall, great 
mounds of rock and shattered parts of old buildings are piled to 
the southeast. Here, stalls stand out ready to offer anything 
that can be found, made, stolen or retrieved. The Herdstalls 
here grant a view of a section fenced off that contains a small 
herd of horses, grazing on the hay tossed to them, or nuzzling 
the troughs of water filled from pipes under the ground.

   A plain building with a low ceiling, this has clearly been 
carved directly out of the mountainside, as the rear of it can be 
seen from here as is rough rock. The entire length of this 
poorly-lit slaughterhouse is visible, with orcs moving back and 
forth chewing on entrails and shovelling anything inedible into a 
flowing water pipe that exits near the northwest of the building. 
The largest of the blackbloods slice at meat hanging from hooks, 
some of it not quite dead yet and screaming in abject terror. 
The bloody counter in one corner of this unpleasant place where 
the large orc attends to customers contains all the meat that has 
been brought here and is available to sell back to others.

The Entrance To The Morgai Tunnel~
   The Mountains of Shadow grace few passages to the minions that 
would cross them into Udun far to the east of here. This 
enormous tunnel, large enough for great wains to pass, leads to 
the Morgai; a row of massive jagged cliffs and ridges rising 
thousands of feet that sits between the mountains and the Udun 
valley. This dead land boasts little of interest beyond stinking 
streams and black thorn bushes barely clinging to life and known 
to produce spikes as long as a snaga's arm and hard as iron. 
Black flies marked with red spots live here and an entire tribe 
of orcs bears the insect's image as its emblem. The Burnt Wings 
are the strongest faction by far here and have total control over 
the Fangs - known as Morgai to others - based out of the Fortress 
of Durthang.

various stylized animals blocks the way. Against the western

   This workshop still bears signs of its intended use, still

disarray, some still bearing a few tools, and all covered with 
scratches. The room is not high, and tall men might risk 
striking their heads upon the ceiling if care is not taken; floor 
and ceiling both are lines with many small tunnels. The door to 
the west is functional, though its face bears scratches, and the 
decorative door of cast bronze to the north is in similar 
condition, bearing marks of battering upon the southern face.

   Not fully separated from the hall to the west, this room is 
more a continuation of the other, differentiated mostly by the 
shelves which have been set on or into the walls; many of them, 
and the items which remain upon them, bear the scratches common 
within these caverns. Across the floors, and behind a few 
fragments of iron thorn-bushes which remain in place even in 
death, are many small tunnels bored into the stone below by black 
roots, now dead and brittle.

Abandoned Kitchens~
   Within this room, everything that remains is covered in 
scratches, in places gouges, left by the iron thorns, including 
the walls and ceiling; the counter against the northern wall and 
the stove and shelves are not exempt. A few small shelves remain 
amidst the larger furnishings, as do a few other bits and pieces, 
but everything else has been removed, giving the place a desolate 
air.

The Fanged Gate Within The Tunnel~
   Great wagons driven by snaga, their whips lashing at the 
deformed creatures pulling loads of supplies and equipment, move 
in both directions down this grimly shaped tunnel. Along with 
them, occasional travellers on foot move in small groups, guarded 
and suspicious. On the gate itself, hooded and armored in 
bristling black maille, enormous trolls waring the insignia of 
the Burnt Wings stand ready to open and close the thick iron 
hinged barriers, each decorated with crooked fangs lancing 
downwards. Beyond to the east, ranks of Uruk-hai with pikes and 
slit-visored full helms stand silent and menacing. None may pass 
further without permission. 
   Westwards the enormous tunnel proceeds past braziers stacked 
with coal and chopped logs. Smoke rises and builds up in places, 
or rushes in dancing wisps towards the large hole up into 
Noirinan.

The Tomb Entrance~
   This large rectangular chamber of plain dark stone has been 
carved out of the ravine with intricate care. Each area of the 
flat surface has been enscribed with sweeping panoramas of the 
West in silvered indents now faded and damaged by the damp and 
time. The southern wall pictures a fleet of ships leaving a 
great port, flags of the Kings of Gondor almost obscuring the 
vessels. The eastern wall reveals horsemen charging across a 
plain broken by the remnants of chariots and strangely-armored 
Easterlings. The western wall portrays a city that juts from a 
pale mountain as if the prow of a ship, tiers rounding each side 
of the promontory. The northern wall is bare, as if ready to 
display feats earned in this place perhaps. Doors lead in all 
directions, guards blocking the way except for into the Morgai 
tunnel.

The Eastern Mittalmar Stall~
   A decrepit and poorly-maintained stall is covered with canvas 
that flaps against the wind and sends in rock dust that covers 
the supplies sold here, what little there are. The woman who 
serves customers is mostly apologetic as she searches through old 
crates and barrels, usually bare of what is sought after. A flap 
in the tent leads back out into the Market.

The Reflected Moon Kitchens~
   Dark-stone walls that are smooth to the touch encompass this 
large cooking hall, the warm air filled with the mixed scents of 
sweet smokeleaf and spicy, fragrant foods. The walls are lined 
with shelves and pantries. The flagstone floor is kept clean by 
dutiful slaves, scrubbing and brushing at the spillages and 
scraps and usually pushing them towards some small holes that 
plunge below. A stone, broad-stepped stairwell has been built 
into a section of the southern wall, leading up to the Lodge 
itself. Topped by a sculpted Reflected Moon symbol, an archway 
is built into the northern wall giving access to a chamber from 
which the sound of hammering and shouting emit at times. Wide 
shelves have been built into a corner of the hall around a large 
stove and cabinetry. A large mantled fireplace, made of various 
shades of river rock, has been built to the side of the 
stairwell, an iron grille set before it to prevent wayward flames 
from escaping its confines. 
   Set into the eastern side of the hall, an iron grille with 
many holes bored into the stone on each side grants access to the 
Slave Pens.

Quarters To The Reflected Moon Shades~
   The dark-stone walls and ceiling of this spacious chamber are 
supported in places by wide pillar, making up this partitioned 
section of the compound. Devised to house a small host of 
people, half-walls have been built to sectionally divide out 
semi-private personal quarters that house plain bunks. There are 
a few gauzy streamers hang from the ceiling, drifting about in a 
lazy fashion on occasion. Casting a dim lighting in the night 
hours are two cast-iron chandelier, the streamers placed with 
care away from their multiple small flames. A black river-rock 
fireplace has been built into the southern wall, at the opposite 
end of the staircase, with sleeping mats cast about it a rough 
shape of a circle. Banners have been arrayed on the walls, all 
proudly bearing the emblems of the Reflected Moon clan.

Office To The Reflected Moon Shades~
   Dimly lit by two silver braziers this lavish oval shaped 
office awaits set with the same light sandstone tiles as the 
abundant halls bearing spidery thin veins of more darker earthy 
hues. The cool white stone walls sit mostly hidden behind silken 
curtains of midnight black and bight white which drape down the 
walls in thick folds. The room is full of movement though 
quietens in the night hours as the fabled Shades of bearing 
generally olive and swarthy complexions go about taking tallies, 
collecting tariffs and completing reports. A fine desk neatly 
covered in parchments, inkwells and various potions, tonics, 
salves and other alchemic substances while the bookshelf near it 
holds numerous tomes and scrolls. One silver edged tapestry 
hangs from the wall to the left side of the desk bearing the 
emblem of Reflected Moon whilst another tapestry of the same make 
hangs from the wall to right bearing a detailed and well 
decorated map of Near and Far Harad. The firmly-guarded northern 
door leads into the Exchange of Reflected Moon whilst a spiraling 
stairwell ascends above. A stone archway leads to a landing to 
the east.

Slave Pens Under the Reflected Moon Kitchens~
   Several pillars running down the length of this elongated 
chamber support the low, barrel-vaulted ceiling of this room. At 
a first glance, it might seem like a spacious, underground 
cellar, but the straw scattered across the ground, the few crude, 
uncomfortable beddings of simple rags and the thick grille 
bearing no lock from the inside, all of that hint at the real use 
of this room: a place to hold several prisoners at once. It is 
very dark here, the only light coming in through the barred 
grille set above where constant noises and activity can be heard. 
Cockroaches and small rodents call this place their territory, a 
flicker of movement visible here and there as they race across 
the floor in search for a morsel of food. As the slaves above 
sweep down scraps and remains of butchering, peelings and 
unwanted food, the rodent populations seems grateful.

A Stone-Walled Crafting Chamber~
   This damaged stone chamber offers a great deal of room for 
labor, with benches, racks and tables filled with tools and 
materials and half-finished projects. Every wall has had a dozen 
large sections taken out of it, effectively forming numerous deep 
shelves. A goodly amount of floor space is available for crates 
and storage bins, with an iron sconce set into a corner of the 
chamber. 
   The northeastern corner of the chamber shows considerable 
damage however, with collapsed rubble from above confirming the 
rockfall that near flattened the eastern half of the Lodge.

The Sunken Arena~
   A wide basin of sunken rock has proven the perfect venue for 
those who wish to train and fight in a large and protected area. 
From above it looks as if a finger has been pressed into the 
valley rockfloor, though from the ground it seems more like water 
damage below caused this entire section to collapse. Whatever 
its origins, the basin drops the height of two olog-hai below 
ground level and grant visitors a private fighting den. Often 
crowds of orcs and humans are in their groups sparring, or 
individuals take on each other for coin or honour. On special 
nights, arranged tournaments boast large crowds who stand at the 
edge of the rising rim and shout out their encouragement and 
blood-rage. 
   The eastern rim rises a little to join half-way up with a wide 
canvas flap, through which the Swill Hole can be reached. A 
wedge has been taken out of the western section, burrowed under 
the rock itself, where the pit fighters and slave champions are 
housed, as well as the Arena Boss. Snaga and slaves are 
constantly slopping away entrails and blood to the northern base 
of the basin wall, where small holes drop away. It is unclear 
what is beneath, but certainly there is a constant scrabbling 
and ferocity of activity below. 
   The part to the north has been separated into three #6training 
areas#0 for the three most numerous factions of the fortress. A 
massive canvas roof stretches across high poles to blot out the 
bastard glare of the sun.

Between The Arena And The Market~
   A great pouring of water rushes westwards towards the Grist 
Mill and the Dead Pond beyond. Presumably the water source is 
the Falls of Sorontil that plunges from above the top of the 
garrison, clearly visible from here almost directly east, sending 
up foam as it strikes the Pipe House trough behind the 
Priest-Lord's manse on the upper tier. Here though, life is more 
humble. The wide trail leads past rubble to the western gate 
under the wall, or it passes east towards the Swill Hole and 
through that into the Arena directly north of the trail, sunk 
beneath the ground. A bridge is also ahead that crosses the 
straight piped river and directs travellers to the Herdstalls and 
Market to the south, as well as into the Morgai Tunnel and up to 
the garrison. 
   The view here is constricted by high mounds of rubble 
interspersed with scavengers and a high wooden fence haphazardly 
lashed together that lines the Arena so that none from here can 
gain a free view down to the fighting below.

to the caged beasts, while also answering various requests from

The Western Mittalmar Stall~
   By no means large, the interior leaves little room for 
stretching. The roof of the tent stands at barely six feet tall, 
so taller individuals may have to duck all together to remain 
within this tent. The short, rickety shelves made of wood are 
available to be lined with items for sale, a broken crate in the 
corner of the tent left to display whatever grisly trophy this 
shopkeep may have come by.

South Western Mittalmar Stall~
   The worn interior is still wholly intact, though it is clear 
that its previous owner left in a hurry. Glass shards are 
scattered along the ground, while dilapidated shelves display 
goods to those who have come in to examine what wares this 
particular tent may hold. The scent of blood and urine is 
present here, more strongly in some portions of the tent than 
others.

The Southern Docks At The Edge of the Dead Pond~
   A small plateau stands at the foot of a smooth wall of black 
rock to the east, overlooking the scattering of buildings on its 
other side. The bulging, dark shape of the Great Foundry squats 
in the distance to the northwest, clouds of black smoke roiling 
around it menacingly, a large number of chimneys reaching towards 
the sky like limbs of some strange creature. Between here and 
the belching monster a wide expanse of dark water stretches, 
shaped like a stillborn curled up to clutch at its head. 
   A small wooden dock comprised of planks nailed together and 
rope lashing against the rocks holds here for now, complete with 
a bell to #6hail#0 the #6ferry#0 from across the lake. Water 
laps heavily against the lumber, bubbles appearing often from 
under the surface of the menacing lake.

Within a Canyon Below Two Towers~
   Encompassing the narrow section of the canyon this small path 
snakes its way along the stony, hard ground. A few crumbling 
bones, with shreds of small pieces of old clothing litter the
landscape. Gently ascending levels of black rock comprise the 
rough walls of the canyon. To the south an unfinished tower juts 
out, seemingly deserted. Looming far overhead to the north the
Spire Keep can be seen, along with a small overhang that slightly 
branches outward. Just below the Spire is a smaller, completed
structure, the claimed home of the Uruk-Hai elite. Two rocky, 
black walls of rock rise up to both the east and west with the 
occasional raven's nest situated upon small ledges. Having very 
sparse vegetation, the wind whisks the loose sand through the air 
as well as a foul, drifting stench. 
   A small, twisting path of stone leads up the northern wall
midway, seemingly blocked by a solid section of rock.

A Small Edge of Rock Besides The Dead Pond~
   Anyone unfortunate enough to find themselves here has 
discovered little of succour or comfort. While the dark and 
unfriendly waters of the Pool stretch north and west, the wall 
blocking access to the garrison and arena faces those who would 
try and escape. Uruk-hai guards far above laugh down at anyone 
whose plight is to be stuck here. The southern rockface is bare 
of marks and grooves here, making climbing to safety a futile 
chore. 
   Some distance to the southwest a small dock can sometimes be 
seen.

to the south. It is offputting that small maelstroms sometimes

are rare and dulled from the mists.

Rippling Waters of the Dead Pond~
   Though the way south is blocked by dark rising rocks that

the surface quite frequently and small fish dart up then away out 
of sight; this rare sight of life lessened in impact by the long 
sinuous creatures that can immediately be seen chasing them.

to the southwest when the air clears momentarily while the rocky

The Dead Pond East of The Gate~
   The southeastern corner of the Foundry almost touches the edge 
of the shoreline of this flooded area, but enough space is left 
for a path to carry travellers north and west beyond. The Dead 
Pond laps at the western stones but stretches off into the thick 
air east and south of here. Dead rats float here rarely, but are 
soon clutched beneath the waters by the creatures that have 
already made this place their home.

Nearing The Middle of the Dead Pond~
   A great weight of water pressing below has an unsettling 
effect on those above; the blackened waters carry soot and worse 
on the surface and the choking air is thicker here. Flurries of 
troughed movement in the thick ripples suggest that life is not 
altogether bereft from this place, though the nature of the 
creatures below remains unknown.

Alone On The Surface of the Dead Pond~
   Nothing stirs here day or night, except in the fiercest of 
storms. The soot and fumes that are drawn to the lake push down 
against the black waters. Drowned birds and dead fish float 
together, their carcasses dragged under the surface or dessicated 
where they lay in the still waters.

   The flotsam of tossed-away wreckage and the remnants of the 
flood start to gather on the eastern edge of the waters; a gently 
sloping rock outcrop lends a natural endpoint to the journey for 
rotting planks, shattered barrels, broken bottles and all manner 
of worthless detritus. Occasionally a spray of urine from above 
is accompanied by dulled laughter as the cruel shouts of uruk-hai 
on the walls sinks down into the fog.

The Dead Pond West of the Grist Mill~
   Where once a canal of water dribbled westwards into the Great 
Foundry and drove forges, contraptions to plane lumber and 
cleaned out the tanning vats, now a constant torrent pours at the 
base of the pool, the hugh vertical wheel turning with a regular 
ease that belies its size and power. The waters here churn and 
fish dart about enjoying the movements. The dark pond stretches 
south and west of here, but to the northwest a small dock stands 
out whenever the mists lift and travellers can be seen walking. 
   You can #Bswim out#0 to the northern bank here.

Northern Stretch of the Dead Pond~
   Sullied excrement floats past on its way westwards, dragged 
underwater by a current that seems to lead under the Foundry 
beyond, out of sight from this part of the Pond; thick whorling 
mist and a faintly metallic stench cloy the senses. Northwards 
the waters thickly lap against a small wooden dock, whereas in 
all other directions the Pond stretches out of sight. 
   You can #Bswim out#0 to the northern docks here.

The Dead Pond East of the Foundry~
   A sucking flow pulls here in the waters near the northwestern 
corner of the flooded waterway; it seems that a way beneath 
empties out a quantity of this lake that is refilled at a 
constant rate by the waterfall high above at the top of the 
ravine's end. Visibility is limited here as the air darkens and 
clouds and strikes strange shapes of cloying creatures and 
dissipating cries.

Under the Dead Pond~
   In the dark of the waters, it is difficult to see anything at 
all. Small fish flit about, noticed only by touch and the 
slippery dash of an eel sometimes whips past impacting on limbs 
or face. However, the force of water pulls to the west quite

stand to the southeast under the waters. The cracks and grooves 
are now homes to small fish and other creatures.

   Massive, tall fortifications shoot upwards to the eastern side

by erosion and now home to eels and flitting pale fish. Some 
very simple and vulgar pictures line the wall along its length 
but slowly decay and dissolve as the waters seep them into 
obscurity. A doorway is set into the wall here.

A Drowned Main Chamber~
   Made entirely of old stone, this main chamber was once of fine 
make and construction, though time has taken its toll, as has the 
flooding. The pass of many boots left sections of the stone 
flooring uneven; its once smooth walls have been chipped and 
cracked in many places, in others crude images and designs have 
been sprawled and scarred, now dissipating from the effect of the 
waters. To the north and south dual arches rise, granting 
passage deeper.

of the stone wall has been defaced, with the rest in poor 
condition. With no natural light in the room, the only exit is 
the crumbled stone arch to the south. Small fish dart about, 
hiding under old crates and shelves.

Touching A Crumbling Bridge Far Below The Surface~
   In the depths of the murky pond, an ancient stone bridge comes 
into view. Time was not merciful, yet it remains standing here, 
defiantly serving its purpose of providing a crossing over the 
old riverbed below, now only the fish and creatures of the waters 
enjoying its use. The railing to the west is missing, as are 
some portions of the structure. Its foundations stretch down out 
of sight.

Under The Submerged Ruined Bridge~
   This flattened area marks the southern bank of a narrow gully, 
punctuated by the crumbling pillars of an aged stone bridge 
spanning overhead. 
   Several ragged targets made of burlap and straw set up to the 
eastern side of the area where a tall wall of dark rock rises to 
cut off the ravine at its narrowest spot from whatever lies 
beyond. A number of broken bolts and arrows litter the ground 
and a few larger boulders have been set out to serve as distance 
markers. It seems these targets were fastened well to the rocky 
ground, for they hold still, though none amongst the fish and 
other life below the pond seem interested.

place.

Swimming Through The Great Market~
   Swimming within a large, dilapidated building, it is clear 
that this has been damaged recently. A stone ceiling lays almost 
entirely destroyed on top of a staircase that lacks any railings 
and crushing the remains of stalls that still wave their canvas 
as the waters flow past. Waterlife swims freely down here, 
darting in and out of the rubble and wreckage. Westwards and 
northwards the building ruins continue.

Swimming Amidst The Ruined Market~
   Partially covered by a makeshift roofing of overlapping hides, 
this underwater den once served as a marketplace inside the walls 
of a dilapidated building, mostly collapsed and sunken now. 
Northwards is a part of the building which still possesses a 
sound roof, a single open doorway leading into it.

The Tavern of the Drowned~
   The insides of an old house once were rebuilt into a spacious 
drinking den. Now the walls are mostly collapsed and where once 
the Mordorian races and classes mingled, now it is the part of 
the fish and eels to slide under broken tables and nest in old 
bottles and shelves. The water presses in from the south through 
an open doorway. 
   Piles of rubble block passage northwards, though judging from 
skeletal hands stretching for help something once was beyond. A 
door swings off its hinges lazily in the heavy dark waters to the 
west.

A Flooded, Pierced Kitchen~
   A few planks of low-quality, splintering wood are nailed over 
a lone window leading to the west, rags stuffed futilely into it 
to block out what was once the light, but is now the fish. The 
hard packed dirt that covered the floor has begun to lift, 
chipped stone tiles visible underneath. In the middle of the 
room, the tiles had been broken and thrown away to give space to 
a crudely built fire-pit, now home to eels. 
   A broken doorway leads eastwards, while a small staircase 
leading down ends suddenly as a large rocky outcrop juts up to 
pierce the room as it fell.

The Sunken Remains of A Building~
   A large, elongated house once stood here, but now there is 
nothing but its outer walls left, and these are badly damaged or 
collapsed as this place died and was flooded. The remains of old 
stalls and small shops, created of a mismatched collection of 
wood, hides, rags, and even bones survive in places as hideyholes 
for the creatures that swim by.

A Debris-Filled Corner in the Collapsed Market~
   Where there was once dilapidated roofing and stalls here, now 
there is a pile of rubble and the crushed remnants of old stalls. 
Drifting detritus floats past in the thick, dark waters. A small 
gap in the rubble leads westards through a crushed doorway.

Submerged Shopfront Under A Hatchway~
   This cramped, ruined remains of a shopfront has seen its 
rotten wooden planks that once served as a ceiling crushed by a 
massive fall of rock. A hatchway stands open above. The walls 
here sport numerous punched out knot-holes in the stone. A 
table, once full of tools judging by the small leather loops 
still here, has been crushed into the floor of this building by 
debris from above that also gave the shop owner is permanent 
sleep, his skeleton jarred into a rough mat by a piercing 
fragment of granite.

A Small Pocket of Safety Under the Dead Pond~
   A simple slab of rock that collapsed from the walls around 
this place has landed directly on top of the old rotten ceiling 
and other rocks have fallen to seal a small area of safety above 
the dark waters. Room enough for a few smaller humanoids, this 
is barely a refuge, more a low and narrow shelf to crawl into.

A Pondside Road Approaching Ancient Fortifications~
   The ravine bottlenecks here, the stone path hugging tight 
against the northern rock wall, overlooking the lapping waters of 
the Dead Pond to the south. An age-worn wall encloses the narrow 
section of the valley, masterfully worked stone blocks keeping 
their shape despite the ravages of time. Further to the south, 
the wall changes into a newer, crudely-built one, presumably 
because the original fortifications gave way to some greater 
forces in that area. A graceful arch eastwards houses a wide 
gateway, but the gate that has been set into it looks ugly, thick 
oak boards hammered together and banded with unevenly spaced bars 
of dark iron. 
   Above, stone steps have been carved around a pillar of rock 
and rise out of sight up towards a large fortress carved out of 
three vertical knuckles of the cliff-side. Directly south the 
turning wheel of the millhouse can be heard, but not seen through 
the murky mists that settle heavily over the pond.

At The Northern Edge of the Dead Pond At A Steep Rock Wall~
   A road cobbled with small uneven stones slowly ascends the 
side of the mountain. The expanse of the Dead Pond to the south 
is as visible from this vantage point as is possible due to the 
cloying dark mists that float above its surface, fed by the smoke 
and debris expulsed from the Great Foundry to the west of here. 
Southwest the outer wall with its huge gate stands firm. Far to 
the south, the opposite side of the ravine slopes sharply 
upwards. 
   A small, hastily-prepared dock of planks and logs has been set 
just above the level of the waters here, complete with a bell 
used to #6hail#0 the #6ferry#0 from across the lake.

Under the Waters of the Canal ~
   The floods from the Falls of Sorontil far above to the east 
have reclaimed this canal, once devoid of life beyond rainfall 
and the slow flow of rivulets to brooks that fed it. Now though, 
the deep waters conceal any below the dark depths and indeed, to 
reinforce this fact, strong metal mesh has been screwed in place 
just below the surface to keep anything leaping free of the 
canal. As the water surges westwards towards a large grate, the 
bottom half has clearly been bent inwards, leaving a gaping hole 
large enough even for a troll were one stupid enough to be here.

   Churning and whirling of water above contests with a dull 
drumming and throbbing of the progress of machinery. 
Occasionally a large blade sweeps down and barely touches a long 
iron grille that keeps any from falling in below, or swimming up 
for air. The flow of water begins to build in pressure 
westwards, sucking in the flow from the Dead Pond to the east.

dark green, but soon is seized by the rushing water and pushed 
away. Long tendrils of slime hang on grimly to the side of the 
canal as the grille above stops any plunging down or reaching up 
for air.

A Narrowing Tunnel Aiming Towards An Ending~
   The rush of the water roars now as it finds the smallest gaps 
of air to sweep through, reaching a wider opening; the gulley 
westwards slams into a circular hole that is secured with 
enormous iron bars that criss-cross tightly, large enough to stop 
anything larger than a fish. 
   A ledge of arching rock allows some escape on the northern 
edge of the water flow, though reaching it against the massive 
press is difficult. This is the end of the underwater river, for 
everything west of here pours out and plunges below. 
   You can try and #Bswim up#0 to safety here.

An Isolated Slab of Rock Under An Arched Rock Ceiling~
   Little of comfort can be found here except the greatest 
perhaps of all; air, the breaths of many come in great gulps here 
if they have swam the length of this place. The breadth of this 
slab is shallow, but there is enough room for even a troll to lay 
down and rest. Pouring at enormous speed towards a great 
thick-barred grille, water pours out and floods downwards out of 
sight. From here, all that can be seen is rock.

Before A Reinforced Grille Where Water Streams Out~
   Above the gully between the mountains, here a huge gush of 
water pours down to crash below and form a new stream that rolls 
down into the forests and hills below. A narrow path leads down 
to the gully from here. Eastwards the huge grille of thick iron 
bars blocks any access beyond. The waters are nearly to the top, 
but a small gap reveals a rocky crevice above the pipe.

A Spacious Converted Warehouse~
   Great twin doors scrape along the gravel outside when opened, 
granting access for wagons and large engines of war to be dragged 
back and forth. Within this old stone garrison building, the 
entire space has been knocked back to present a single floor with 
a smaller mezzanine above dominating the upper eastern section. 
Long shelves have been recently installed, as the wood is still 
firm, unlike the rotted piles of old furniture and remnants of a 
previous life shovelled into corners.

slightly below the original girders protruding from many points, 
this landing is held firm by thick iron hinges and is used for

Quarters To The Reflected Moon Officers~
   This medium-sized rectangular quarters is orderly and is 
occupied by two comfortable beds, and a finely-crafted desk with 
a pair of bronze lamps affixed to the wall above it. Off-white 
stone walls rise to a high ceiling, all of it kept perfectly 
clean. The flagstone floor has been carpeted by a large, 
tightly-woven rug. Simple and carefully arranged, the room has 
no frills, being obviously a military person's domain. Drapes 
hang on the walls, pale yellow edged in red, obscuring two small, 
iron barred windows in the eastern wall. Twin long banners of 
the Reflected Moon hang off the northern wall, on either side of 
the desk and carefully arranged away from the bronze lamps. 
Notably, the ceiling off this quarters has been washed a dark 
blue, with the southern set cedar door having been carved with 
the emblem of the Reflected Moon.

The Beastmaster's Cages~
   A wide passage runs through the rows of lopsided, yet 
sturdy-looking cages of rusted iron. The heat is stifling here, 
coupling with the sharp smell of dirty, sick animals to create an 
mixture that threatens to overwhelm the senses. Creatures of 
various size and kind have been trapped here, awaiting the time 
when they'll be released into the Arena.

   Of black rock polished to a sheen, this square chamber is 
large enough to house a multitude of chests and treasures. 
Paymasters come and go and soldiers watch on, themselves 
monitored by officers and guards trusted here. Several desks are 
occupied at all times of the day and night by clerks and their 
hefty ledgers, recording pay and names, handing out coins and 
sliding scrolls and parchments onto the high shelves occupying 
every wall they are able to. The far southeastern corner

Twisted Iron and Stone Chamber~
   A crazed arraignment of iron poles and twisted ruined lamp 
poles have been hammered into the stony floor here as it descends 
northwards, holding up great slabs of garrison house rooftops. 
Above, it appears that a great deal of the wreckage has been 
removed to form a small loft with a twisted metal ladder leading 
up to it. This small pocket of space is enough to house cooking 
equipment and stone tables, along with some storage space as 
well. An entryway has been dug out of the northern wall, leading 
to a crudely-built smokehouse. A trapdoor leads down to the 
storage area from which dirty tankards and plates of meat are 
moved to the main tavern.

Circular Chamber Behind The Sunken Arena~
  This large circular space has been painstakingly carved out of 
the ground with rough hands and tools. Old furniture and 
remnants of better times long ago are carefully arranged around 
this place, which seems to serve as some form of common area for 
the Gladiators, Slaves, and Arena Staff. Various banners are 
hung about the area, representing several different organizations 
represented here, but a banner of the Blood Watch is prominently 
displayed. A stone archway leads out toward the pyre and 
eventually, the Arena. There are heavy wooden doors to the north 
and west, while an archway leads to the Gladiator training area 
to the south and a ramp leads down to the Gladiator barracks. 

  A small OOC #4sign#0 is here.

Spacious Storage Cave~
   By accident rather than design this chamber is clearly larger 
than expected. A high rough-stone ceiling has been left 
unfinished, while the sloping floor careers down northwards at an 
angle after a wide flat area bears storage crates and the like. 
This collapsed section seems to have been damaged by flooding, 
and a pipe can be seen. The sound of roaring water can be heard, 
charging all the way from the Falls of Sorontil, the bathhouses 
and all the way past here to the Grist Mill and Dead Pond and 
then out of the Slums to pour into the northern end of the ravine 
beyond the fortress.

A High-Vaulted Chamber Under the Ravine's End~
   While the heavy stone door to the west seems to hold up the 
weight of the mountain above, a natural cavern opens up here, 
stretching eastwards, barred in places by high-panelled 
partitions to form a series of smaller chambers. Staring up, the 
erosion of limestone has formed large cracks in the jagged 
ceiling, perhaps twenty feet above. Slow drips of water still 
hang and fall from the stalactite clusters. To try and temper 
the damp here, canvas sheets are pulled over the partitions, and 
numerous firepits send smoke and warmth up among the calcite 
formations, all flowing towards a central widened hole bored 
upwards and out of sight, presumably funnelling the smoke away. 
   Servants and slaves of the Upper Steward busy themselves with 
brooms, crates, buckets, or they rush in and out calling out the 
needs of the inhabitants of the Garrison of Noirinan.

A Widened Storage Chamber~
   While the maple-panelled partition stretches north-south about 
the western door and rises to half the height of the cavern, at 
the opposite side of this space the ceiling plunges and a stone 
block wall blocks access to chambers beyond. Cold and damp, the 
stone floor here shows bumps and ridges, where stalagmites have 
been sorn and rubbed flat, dripstones split by picks long ago and 
set flat. Firepits keep the area dry and high shelves and 
containers are all placed atop a raised series of criss-crossed 
planks that offer a walkway just above the floor.

fireplace set into the southern rockwall just behind it is lit. 
A firm door protects access to this office, while a further 
doorway to the east leads to what must be a small chamber.

A Narrow Bedchamber~
   Beneath the plunging rockwall, this partition reaches the far 
end of the cavern where the walls have been left rough and 
jagged. A large fireplace combats the permanent cold, though 
more comfort is offered by the way of the many tapestries, rugs 
and the like arraigned here. A small door leads to the Upper 
Steward's office.

The Slave Pens Outside a Pair of Low Stone Buildings~
   From this barren yard, fenced in and guarded at all times, 
slaves can see the hopelessness of their situation here, should 
they have thoughts of escape. Orc sentries seem to be patrolling 
the ravine walls that press to the south and north, while at 
ground level there seems to always be caravans of supplies and 
fresh slaves travelling along the southern roadway. A market of 
sorts seems to beckon to the west, while over a waterway of some 
sort to the northwest a drinking den has been placed within one 
of the large mounds of ruined buildings, judging by the orcs and 
humans who go in and out. The main view though is of the 
impressive rising garrison of stone to the east, blocking the 
short way to end of the ravine within this fortress of Egthela. 
   A large open gateway leads back to the Slave Halls to the 
east.

an uneven floor. Behind the counter is an ample area for the

individuals to do the necessary work to operate it. A large hole 
has been carved in to the roof to create a vent leading to the

increasing their chances of survival. The occasional drip of 
water leaking from the cave walls can be heard as small puddles 
have formed on the ground and moss has grown on the cave walls.

Arena Preparation Room and Pyre~
   Carved out of the stone itself, this large preparation room is 
the last stop before stepping in to the Arena. Blood splattered, 
craggy stone walls have been painstakingly hand carved by slaves. 
Gladiators move about the area, making their last preparations 
before heading in to the glory of battle. The most noticeable 
feature is the gigantic pyre that has been dug in to the center 
of the room. The pyre is littered with burned bones and remnants 
of corpses. Gigantic, grotesque-looking gargoyle statues stand 
all around the Pyre, raising sconces that burn brightly with 
flame. A large, heavy steel cave gate leads to the Arena to the 
east, while a stone archway leads further in to the cave to the 
west. There are heavy wooden doors to the north and south. A 
dark ramp leads downwards under the grounds of the Arena itself.

it was never really finished. It looks as if the room was once 
regularly habitated, as if it were private quarters, but now it 
has been stripped out and renovated into a makeshift workshop.

Blood stains are splashed all across the side walls and dried

to those gathered within. Various shredded cloth pieces are

is a constant stench of rotted, diseased and sometimes decaying 
flesh. This is not a comfortable place to be, but if it takes

   Narrow but long, this rectangular room is more of a corridor 
than a practical space. Arches at the widest points lead east 
and west, while the southern wall is covered in noise-muffling 
tapestries of sand, cities and the oceans, ensuring that the 
sounds coming from the Lodge beyond are hushed to a dull, rushing 
murmur. Tracing the pale stone northern wall, the floor is 
studded by a series of small metal braziers that serve to provide 
light and year-round warmth. To one side of the wood-carved 
southern doorway is a set of steps made of the same creamy stone 
tiles as the walls, leading downwards. The other side of the 
doorway possesses a similar set of steps leading upwards, a 
wooden doorway at the top preventing access to the room above. 
The rest of the cold floor has been dampened by dense rugs and 
seating cushions.

   This dusky storeroom is organized very neatly and in specific 
order. Though dust seems to have settled on the walls that are 
lined with aged bottles and casks, this area is still trafficked 
frequently by the Vault Keeper.

A Lush Courtyard~
   This fairly large courtyard leads on a path towards a 
well-built stone estate. Although few things grow in most of the 
Spire, plant-life thrives here, clearly carefully tended, and 
neatly cut hedges line the winding gravel pathway. Polished 
marble steps lead up to an ancient, ornately carved door leading 
into the estate building itself. The whole area looks to be of 
fairly new construction, and bears few of the signs of wear and 
tear common throughout the otherwise run-down parts of the Spire 
of Egthela.

A Large Entry Hall~
   Broad and spacious, this white marble-floored entry hall 
extends for quite some distance beyond the entryway. The center 
of this hall is lined with a dark blue carpet which runs toward 
the base of some stairs visible at the end of the hall. The 
walls are lined with banners bearing a scale with an entwined 
snake, flanked by a fox and a mongoose. Two mannequins have been 
constructed here, garishly armed in shining suits of bronze plate 
so meticulously polished that they are nearly damaging to the 
eye. A somewhat plain doorway stands just to the west, while 
eastward a wood-framed door stylized with crystal panes allows 
view into a spacious dining hall.

A Spacious Dining Hall~
   A beautiful chandelier that is composed of of multi-colored, 
finely-wrought glassworks and likely worth a small fortune is 
suspended over this fine and spacious dining hall. Carefully 
laid pinewood flooring contrasts pleasantly against the solid, 
light-blue painted stone walls. A thick rug of a deep indigo 
blue covers much of the floor underfoot. The wood-framed door to 
the west is inset with crystal panes to allow those inside this 
room a glance into the great hall beyond, while a simplistic, 
undecorated door leads north.

A Cozy Sitting Room~
   This warm and cozy room is somewhat dark, with its furry black 
rug and auburn painted walls. A fireplace is built into the 
southern wall of this room and is surrounded by plush leather 
armchairs, providing comfortable heated seating during even the 
coldest of winters. The room is lined with the heads of various 
large game and animals, one wall even sporting the tusk of a bull 
mumakil which takes up nearly the whole length of the room. 
While not overly large, this room could comfortably hold and 
entertain at least eight guests.

A Well-Stocked Kitchen~
   This rather spacious kitchen has a faint smell of herbs and 
spices. Further inspection reveals a recently swept floor with 
very little built-up grime or filthiness. The walls are panelled 
wood, and have been sanded smooth. A polished brass lantern 
hangs from the ceiling, casting its warm light over the area. To 
the south is a plain wooden door, matching another door to the 
north. A heavy, solid-looking trapdoor is set into the floor in 
the northwestern corner of the room.

A Drafty Wine Cellar and Basement~
   Cobwebs hang from the walls of this basement wine cellar. 
Enclosed in cold stone below the ground, rows of wine racks and 
oversized kegs line the walls of this chamber. A heavy layer of 
dust covers everything towards the back of this room, where a few 
empty crates have been carelessly tossed. No natural light 
breaches the confines of this chamber, and a single lantern hangs 
from a metal wire attached to the fairly high ceiling.

A Dimly Lit Servant's Sleeping Room~
   Simple in design and decorum, this smallish chamber houses 
rows of beds for those who attend to the needs of the owner of 
this manor. The stone-mortared walls have been painted a dark 
blue shade, but are still rather rough to the touch. Solid 
wooden planking lines the floor, and has been kept clean and 
dust-free, though it could stand a bit of polishing. Simple 
wooden doors stand to the south, where the sounds of a bustling 
kitchen can be heard, and west, which leads out in to the 
hallway.

The End of the Hall~
   White-painted, wooden stairs lead up toward the top of a 
balcony, a runner of dark blue carpet neatly descending them. 
Solid globes of polished brass have been placed atop the railing. 
The floor is composed of a colorful marble mosaic that one must 
walk across before ascending the staircase or exiting through the 
wooden doors at the end of the hallway. To either side of the 
staircase is a potted tree, each rising twice the height of a 
man, though they barely brush the ceiling. Large skylights in 
the roof of the hall allow light to stream in during the day, 
which causes the leaves of the trees to glow with verdant green 
light whenever a stray sunbeam catches them.

A Balcony Overlooking the Entry Hall~
   This elegant, sweeping balcony curves above the southern 
portion of the grand hall that is clearly visible below. The 
railing is of meticulously painted wood, gleaming with a 
brilliant white shine that contrasts strikingly against the dark 
wood floor and vibrant, plush red carpet that runs up the steps 
and down the length of the balcony. Small, rounded marble tables 
are set to either side of the staircase, each holding a lushly 
green potted plant. A painting is displayed on the wall opposite 
the stair, and depicts a Numenorean woman in repose.

A Lavish Sitting Room~
   This room has been decorated with a simple stately elegance. 
The floors are covered with a soft brown wool carpeting and the 
walls have been painted a deep crimson color. Pine moulding 
lines the ceiling and has been stained a deep dark shade. Golden 
sconces hang on the walls, giving off a soft, warm light. An 
archway leads west into a sewing room and a small library study 
has been set into the eastern wall. Double doors lead north to 
the master bedroom. The room has been furnished with luxury and 
comfort in mind.

An Organized Study and Library~
   Lavishly appointed, this office mingles business and luxury 
with stylistic ease. The smooth, dark wooden panelling of the 
walls and floor has been kept in pristine, polished condition. 
The ceiling is painted a soft white, creating an illusion of even 
more space in the already generously-sized room. An intricately 
patterned rug in bright Haradaic colors is spread between the 
doorway and the large desk. A statue is posed in one corner, 
depicting a heavily armored Numenorean soldier, standing guard 
keeping watch over the entire room. Almost every wall space is 
lined with tall bookshelves stocked full of various tomes and 
other written works. The room is always neatly organized, 
showing a great deal of care.

providing a soft surface to walk on. A fireplace has been built 
into one wall, directly opposite from the large window which 
looks out upon the dropoff over the entire Spire of Egthela. The 
door set to the east leads back into the sitting room of the 
master suite.

   Quite spacious, this airy bedchamber boasts several arched 
glass windows, the panes kept crystal clear and sparkling. 
Breezy light blue linen curtains are draped artfully about 
windowframes, the generous swaths falling to brush the dark 
hardwood floor. The walls and ceilings are painted a soft white, 
giving the room even more of an open, pristine feel. Off to one 
corner, an elaborate screen is set up, providing privacy for 
whomever decides to luxuriate in the bath sequestered behind it.

A Desert Muraled, Walk-In Wardrobe~
   With enough room for two people to get dressed at the same 
time, this wardrobe is not opulently large, but the close space 
is surrounded by a number of wooden rails on both the west and 
eastern walls, and shelves both above, below, and covering the 
northern surface. The walls behind the rails and in-between the 
shelves has been crudely painted a sandy brown that rises up from 
a similarly coloured carpet in hundreds of long, vertical 
brushstrokes. Dotted amid the painted grasses are an assortment 
of umbrella-shaped Acacia trees, while higher up the wall, 
distant purple-grey hills can be seen. On the western wall, 
between two shelves, a handful of blobbed, trunk-bearing grey 
animals can be seen in assorted sizes, but it is difficult to 
tell whether they are normal sized elephants, or mumakil that are 
just further into the distance.

A Private Garden~
   Entirely surrounded by tall stone walls, this quiet area 
offers a retreat from the hustle of everyday life. A small stone 
statue is placed in the center of the grass and surrounded by a 
bed of colorful flowers. The rose stone path curves gracefully 
around it and by a garden bench near. The flowering shrubs at 
the base of the house form a riot of colors and scents. Vines 
showing off their colorful flowers climb the grey stone of the 
house. The crushed stone path returns to the manor to the south.

the crowds above can be heard thrumming here, and the only light 
shines through the iron grille above. A set of wooden stairs, 
stained and reeking of urine, lead upwards through the grille 
when its opened onto the sandy grounds of the Arena. Slabs of 
slate hold some large stone chests, awaiting the Gladiators who 
are to fight in the Arena.

   This dark ramp is fairly narrow, leading down under the

as well as fetid old feces and other trash. The ceiling lowers 
as the ramp descends until it is little more than a tunnel. An 
iron barred gate seals off the tunnel at its end, though a small 
chamber can be seen through the bars.

curtains of a darker shade hang over tall windows that look out 
onto the Manse grounds. Bronze lamps have been hung on the walls 
to provide a sufficient light when night has fallen.

A Large Stone-Floored Common Room~
   This wide and long stone-floored hall serves as the common 
room to the Freeblades of Egthela. Tables are arranged 
throughout the hall, as are stone-bricked fireplaces and 
wrought-iron sconces that hold flickering flames. A narrow 
passage leads further to the northern part of the compound, with 
a solid staircase leading up to the second floor built right 
aside the passage. Heavy beams and posts support the smoke 
stained ceiling. Swarthy men and women, clad in dusty armour and 
traveling attire, pass through quietly on occasion, or mingle in 
low conversation in the hall. A heavy wood door seals off the 
passage through the southern wall out into the street.

   Spicy smoke, from food and leaf, curls around the ceiling of 
this dimly-lit messhall. A few round tables have been arranged 
on the stone floor, with chairs surround them. Wrought-iron 
sconces have been set at intervals on the wall, casting a dim 
light from the flickering flames held within. A stone bar runs 
along a section of the northern wall, and aside the passage 
heading south to the front of the compound a solid stone 
staircase lays, leading up to the second floor. Heavy beams and 
posts support the smoke stained ceiling.

The Rigging Rats Gambling Lounge~
   Sweet smelling smoke curls near the ceiling of this dimly lit 
lounge, drifting about from the few patrons mingling about the 
establishment. A wood-framed painting, depicting a tumultuous 
storm beating down a on a twin-masted skiff in many vibrant 
colours, is hung upon one of the walls, with a few cushioned 
booths arranged underneath for seating. There is a regular crowd 
of men, dour and mostly dark-skinned, who all surround the room's 
tables taking risks at games of chance. One of the corners has 
been roped off into a ring, the wood-plank floor worn with nicks 
and scars in places, bearing a few splotchy blood stains. The 
walls here have a dark wash, lending to a dim and cooler 
atmosphere. There are few slaves and servants loitering about in 
the lounge, and those that do move about do so in an efficient 
and quiet obedience. Brightly-coloured pillows have been bunched 
and arranged about low tables, roughly circling one larger 
hardwood table where scantly-clad slave girls can be seen dancing 
day and night. Occasionally, cursing and cheering can be heard 
from the gaming tables, above the mostly serious and quiet 
conversation.

A Smoky Dimly-Lit Backroom~
   Old smoke stains the dark-washed ceiling and walls of this 
cramped back room. Every flat surface is cluttered and covered 
with various utensils, implements, and scraps of faded parchment. 
The grungy floor is littered with things like wooden tubs, 
barrels, nets, and rickety crates. Dim lamps provide meagre 
light and plenty of shadow, with a rickety ladder leading up 
through a hole in the ceiling, and a scratched, sturdy wooden 
door leads back out into the common area of the lounge. In 
moments of great quiet, the faint sound of scratching and 
scurrying can be heard beneath the creak of the floorboards 
underfoot.

   Heavy, fragrant wood panels this room from floor to ceiling, 
lanterns hung in all four corners and the centre of the room 
casting dim, uneven light throughout and sending the shadows in 
the corners and upon the walls dancing with every shift of air 
current. The walls are lined with a hodgepodge of double-storied 
hammocks and stiff-mattressed bunks with threadbare coverings. 
The room has little in the way of decoration, resembling a ship's 
cabin down to the lack of windows and ladder leading to a 
backroom-looking area below.

A Private Sitting Area~
   The rich maple that panels the ballroom beyond extends into

despite the constantly-lit fireplace, which provides the only 
light to the room when Anor no longer sheds thin light through 
the heavily-draped windows. The furnishings follow the Manse's 
theme of vainly grasping at glorious decadence, much of it 
antique and lacking somewhat in comfort. 
   A small, heavy door seals the way back into the ballroom, 
blending with the panelling of the walls.

Inside an Imposing Wooden Siege Wagon~
   The room within this wagon is quite massive and spacious, 
allowing for even the tallest of humans the ability to stand 
fully erect. The entire interior is nothing but crudely 
patchworked fire-hardened wood lashed together to create a 
surprisingly sturdy enclosure. Over a dozen misshapen windows 
have been carved out easily allowing those within to fire off 
several volleys. Below these windows there are two long wooden 
benches nailed down on each side which easily allows thirty men 
to comfortably sit. In the frontmost wall a small window has 
been carved allowing those within to speak to the driver, while 
in the back rests a massive fire hardened wooden gate with chains 
and winches attached, keeping it closed and shut with relative 
ease.
