surcoat grizzly bear fur emblazoned crimson spider UNIQUE Black Widows byCeredir LEATHER~
a surcoat of grizzly bear fur emblazoned with a crimson spider~
A heavy surcoat of grizzly bear fur lies crumpled here.~
   A greasy surcoat composed of matted brown fur with a reddish 
tinge, this article of clothing has seen its fair share of 
exposure to both elements and warfare. Marred throughout with 
visible lacerations and gouges piercing clean through the base of 
the hide, it is amazing how this garment is still remaining 
intact. Carefully intertwined with an assortment of fangs, 
claws, teeth and shriveled eyes, it is evident that the trophies 
adorning it were clearly taken and kept as a sentimental reminder 
of past victories achieved. Crusty stains of dried blood and an 
awful smell emanating from the fur hints that this piece has 
never been washed. 
   Faded only just slightly is the image of a Crimson Spider 
which was once boldly emblazoned on this heavy surcoat.

A wobbly table stands not too far from the entrance, its wood stained.~
   This table has probably seen better times, and quite a long 
time has passed since then. The four legs are not of equal 
length, causing it to wobble precariously, threatening to spill 
any tankard or a mug sitting atop it. A number of stains cover 
the dark wooden tabletop, a clear sign that many a drink has 
already been spillt onto it already. There are four chairs in a 
state similar to that of the table.

close to the bar, from boxes to tall wooden blocks to a single 
hardwood barstool of a simple make.

out or back in easily. A trio of wooden chairs are drawn close

unsteadsily, threatening to fill the nights with unpleasant 
squeaks and creaks produced by the sleeping person's movements. 
It seem this piece of old furniture would fall apart should it 
lose the support of a wall beside it. A straw mattress is ridden 
with holes, adding to the discomfort. A number of dirty rags 
serve as a makeshift blanket.

A wooden club with bronze spikes has been cast aside here.~
   This club is about three feet long and is made from a solid 
piece of timber which has been planed smooth and varnished to a 
high shine. It is narrow at one end, the handle being wrapped 
with supple leather to give a solid grip while the top is 
significantly broader. Several rows of sharp bronze spikes, 
about half an inch long, are attached at regular intervals along 
the striking and of this basic, yet effective weapon, designed 
more to inflict pain than to be particularly deadly.

forearm and only as thick as a man's wrist. Its weight is almost 
nonexistant and its balance is perfect for lightning-fast slashes 
and stabs at the junctions of an enemy's armor. The entire 
weapon is cast from bronze, with a circular disc for a handguard 
and rounded, flat-bottomed piece for a pommel.

mounted on a dagger hilt. Three fullers run down the length of 
the slender blade, while the cylindrical hilt doesn't possess a 
proper hand guard, but, instead, a couple of protuberances on 
either end to keep the wielding hand in place. The entire length 
of this solid bronze dirk barely measures the length of a man's 
forearm.

   Fashioned from lightweight horn material, the shaft of this 
short spear is polished and engraved with dark sigils from one

in the shape of a narrow-bladed leaf. Purposefully head-heavy, 
this weapon would prove ideal for throwing but unwieldy in close 
combat.

axe GOOD_QUALITY curve-bladed war Balchoth METAL~
a long-handled, curve-bladed war axe~
A war axe with a long handle and curved blade is here.~
   This lengthy weapon is forged of dark bronze and wrapped in 
leather. The shaft is as long as a man's torso, with a large 
axe-blade attached to the end curving downward to offer a longer 
killing edge. Detailed engravings adorn almost the entire sides 
of the axe blade. Whorls and sigils form a bas-relief into the 
metal itself.

a wedge-tipped bronze morningstar~
A bronze morningstar lays here on the ground.~
   A bulbous, knobby head of bronze has been fixed onto a short 
shaft of pale, polished horn. Not a smooth surface is to be 
found on the weapon's head, as numerous wedge-shaped mountains 
erupt from every available surface. Lengths of wire and leather 
have been liberally bound to the horn hilt's base to provide an 
excellent swinging grip.

shortsword GOOD_QUALITY leaf razor bronze Balchoth METAL~
a leaf-bladed, razor-edged bronze shortsword~
A bronze shortsword with a razor edge lays here.~
   This short-bladed sword has a distinctive design to it, the 
blade belling out towards the middle before terminating in a long 
point. Its twin edges are razor-sharp to the touch and its point 
is as keen as a needle. Despite its war-ready manufacture, its 
ornamentation has a minimalist approach to it. Its 
leather-wrapped hilt and bronze pommel are plain in appearance, 
while only a single row of small sigils adorn the centre of the 
blade.

maul GOOD_QUALITY ram bronze Balchoth METAL~
a rams-head-casted, solid-bronze maul~
A solid-bronze maul with a head shaped like a rams is here.~
   This unwieldy and lengthy weapon is almost too heavy for a 
normal man to lift, let alone wield. Its three-foot shaft is 
forged from a single length of hexagonal bronze wrapped in dark 
leather, gold thread painstakingly worked into the leather to 
form designs and sigils from top to bottom, whereas its head is 
solid bronze, a single mass cast into the intricate detail of a 
ram's head complete with fiercely polished eyes and curving 
knobby horns. While this ornamental weapon would be awkward and 
unwieldy on the battlefield, it could still do horrendous, 
bone-crushing damage.

A single-edged bronze sword with a concave blade is here.~
   This longsword has a single edged bronze blade that pitches 
forward towards the point, the edge being concave on the lower 
part of the sword, but convex on top. This shape distributes the 
weight in such a way that is capable of delivering a blow with 
the momentum of an axe, while maintaining the cutting edge of a 
sword. The bronze hilt is hook- shaped, the end being stylized 
in the shape of a bird.

A bronze broadsword with a single edge is here.~
   This wide-bladed, single-edged sword is slightly shorter then 
a longsword but still longer than a shortsword for versatility in 
combat. Forged from a single sheet of hammered bronze and 
burnished to a fierce glow with an edge ground down to an almost 
razor-like quality, it is capable of inflicting brutal slashes 
and chops with minimal effort. Its hilt is a simple disk of 
beaten bronze, engraved with minute sigils and darkened to stand 
out against the ruddy metal, while its hilt is unadorned bronze, 
wrapped in treated leather before it terminates in a squat, 
bulbous pommel marked by a single, detailed rune.

   Made from old wood, this simple staff has been worn smooth 
through the ages. The ebonwood used in its making has been 
engraved heavily, beginning at the foot of the staff and slowly 
spiralling up its length. Upon its head, two dozen strips of 
leather have been fastened, each one bearing a single charm, be 
it a sliver of bone, a precious stone or even simple scraps of 
cloth.

it is simple in construction, lacking any form of adornment save 
for a single, polished sigil etched into the bottom of the 
spear's buttplate.

the three-tipped blade razor-sharp and balanced with a heavy 
bronze sphere at the other end for quick, precise thrusts. The 
lightweight material of the shaft has been completely covered 
from one end to the other in leather straps to allow its wielder 
to grip it where ever they wish.

   This short-shafted thrusting spear is made of bronze and horn. 
Instead of the common leaf-blade shape of a spear, its end has 
four long, slender spikes of bronze fixed into the pale, ivory 
shaft, with eight more in a star pattern horizontal to the 
thrusting end to keep the weapon from plunging too deep into a 
body.

end bound tightly in treated leather, a loop hanging from that 
end so it might be attached to the wielder's hip. Starting a 
handspan up from the grip are neat rows of bulbous bronze studs, 
cast from the same mould as the rod itself in order to deal 
painful, bludgeoning blows.

wielder's hand, proving that this weapon is specialized for 
extreme close-combat and little else. The blade extents from the 
top of its leather-wrapped horn shaft and then steeply juts 
downward to curve around the wielder's hand and connect to the 
base.

of bronze cast into the shape of a wedge is attached to a shaft 
of polished horn, long enough to fit a hand comfortably without 
sacrificing the weight and speed necessary to maim flesh with the 
relatively unsharpened axe blade. The vaguely curved length of 
the shaft has sigils carved at sporadic places from top to 
bottom.

A two-handed, heavily-curved bronze sword is here.~
   This long-hilted weapon boasts a bronze blade as long as a 
man's torso that curves outward at a steep angle reminiscent of a 
farmer's sickle or a particularly long-bladed axe. Only the 
outer edge of this weapon has been cast with an edge, the inward 
side of the crescent remaining flat and relatively harmless. 
Etched into the blade's edge are numerous sigils perpendicular to 
the curve, while a few more have been carefully stitched in 
bronze thread through the leather-wrapped hilt.

fletched with rigid feathers and topped by a narrow-bladed bronze 
tip, little more then a spike of metal hammered into place. 
While unremarkable in construction, it is none the less of 
passable worksmanship.

harm, its flat, polished bronze tip bearing three inward-curving 
spines on each side to inflict flesh-shredding wounds if 
carelessly removed from the unfortunate being it happens to be 
lodged in. The shaft of this arrow is a yard in length and bears 
a multitude of long, black fletchings.

before being threaded through narrows holes in this bow's lower 
limb, dangling free and out of the way of the waxed, sinew

fastened to two polished, pale-white halves of a single horn from 
some large animal, engraved with sigils along their lengths from 
front to back.

   This longbow has been put together with some moderate skill, 
layers of horn and sinew carefully moulded to form limbs that 
extend a fair distance above and bellow its middle. The grip 
itself seems to have been carved from a larger piece of solid 
horn, ridges and an arrow rest carved with care into it for the 
benefit of the archer. At the end of each limb of the longbow, a 
hooked cap of bronze has been fitted firmly to the horn, both to 
prevent splitting and to allow a sturdy length of sinew to be 
nocked between either end.

solid piece of oak, grooves, notches, and hollows carved into it 
to allow the cast-bronze mechanisms of the crossbow to function. 
Thin bronze plates have been bound to the sides of the wood, 
complex looking sigils intricately detailing their surface. The 
laths of the bow are formed from two short, yellowed lengths of 
horn, a thick length of sinew stretched firmly between them.

been bound in bronze along the rim, and then riveted with metal 
rivets throughout its surface. Close to being placed near 
dead-center in the middle of the buckler is a dull and nicked 
boss of bronze, a charm sigil carved in the dark metal.

from thick, woven wicker. Countless lengths have been woven 
together to create this lightweight armament. Around its edge, a 
thin strip of unpolished bronze has been fixed with stubby bolts 
to prevent the shield unravelling. Surprisingly light and easy 
to use, it provides the barest protection against a sword or 
edged weapon, though it is peerless against arrows and bolts. 
Upon its front, several thick hides have been stitched, giving a 
further element of protection. The tanned surface has been 
painted with a variety of symbols and sigils.

are capable of being tied onto most pieces of armor fit for a 
torso. A short tube of leather extends further down from the 
pauldron to cover the wearer's upper arm from attack, while 
further protection can be found in the bronze scales riveted into 
place all along the arm.

A bronze, cage-visored warhelm is here.~
   Fashioned from solid bronze and constructed to snugly fit 
against the majority of a person's head, this spangenhelm boasts 
long cheekguards that end just below the jawline before flaring 
out for easy gripping. The back portion that protects the neck 
is constructed in a similar fashion, though with the added bonus 
of being marginally thicker and without the benefit of a flared 
edge. The front is adorned by a lengthy noseguard that forms the 
basis of a cage-formed face mask. Horizontal and vertical bars 
of bronze, cast from a single mold, are kept in place via rivets 
which run the length of the noseguard as well as the edges of the 
cheekguards, its construction making the wearer's face 
unreachable by all but the thinnest of weapons.

below the waistline of an individual, if fitted properly. The 
bands of bronze that form the brunt of this armor's protective 
qualities are spaced evenly apart, no more then a pinkie's width 
from one another to allow for a greater range of mobility when 
coupled with the midsection of the leather beneath being less 
stiff then the rest.

   Plates of burnished bronze form the framework for a barbute 
styled helmet. The wearer's features shrouded from view save for 
the narrow gaps in the faceplate that form the trademark T-shape. 
These gaps have been further reinforced by thin bars of bronze 
riveted horizontally over the eye slot as well as vertically down 
the nasal bridge for addition protection without sacrificing too 
much in the way of visibility. This heavy warhelm boasts a crest 
atop its skullplate, though not one that is made of horse hair or 
feathers, but of metal. A razor-edged blade crests the top of 
this helmet and juts forward to a point like the slope of a 
cliff, more decorative then practical in a battle. Adorning it's 
surface are a multitude of archaic runes and pictographs 
carefully and lovingly detailing moments of battle, animals, 
experiences, and other less obvious symbolism.

waist, this piece of burnished bronze armour forms a solid 
protective shell, and the of of it flares outwards from the body 
slightly so as to provide some minimal torso flexibility. Front 
to back and top to bottom, this piece boasts countless depictions

of iconic imagery and symbolism detail a life's work and 
experiences.

belt supple hanging bronze trinkets leather LEATHER~
a supple leather belt with hanging bronze trinkets~
A supple leather belt rests here, its bronze trinkets glinting.~
   This wide belt is made from thin leather, polished to a shine 
and set at constant intervals with plates of bronze in the shapes 
of large, stylized animals. Halfway between each plate are set 
two bronze studs, and, alternating top to bottom, each set of 
studs has a short bronze chain from which is hung a 
diamond-shaped bronze disc, with a gold-inlaid engraving set on 
it. The leather itself has been tooled, abstract patterns 
running its length. Rather than a buckle, this belt is designed 
with a loop in one end, allowing it to be passed through, looped 
about again, and the remaining of the belt, ending in a bronze 
cap, to hang in a decorative tail.

a short-sleeved, closely-fitted tunic of $finecolor linen~
An embroidered, $finecolor short-sleeved tunic sits here.~
   Belted at the waist and flaring out slightly to where it ends 
mid-thigh, this $finecolor tunic is of a thin linen, its cut 
keeping it close to the wearer's body. Its sleeves end just 
above the elbow, a zig-zag cut between there and halfway to the 
shoulder giving the sleeves a trailing appearance. The garment 
is heavily embroidered, images set against the fabric while 
various lines of thread trace the spaces between.

a supple, $finecolor leather skirt, threaded with bronze~
A supple $finecolor leather skirt is here.~
   This carefully-dyed $finecolor leather skirt hangs to just 
below the knee, and is formed into broad box-pleats in order that 
it do little to hinder the wearer's steps. Though the panels of 
leather are sewn together with lengths of sinew dyed to match the 
leather itself, and thus are nigh invisible save on close 
examination, each of the panels, even those primarily hidden by 
those in front of them, are traced lightly with bronze, the 
majority of them bearing the outline of an animal surrounded by a 
few trailing lines of bronze.

a long. loose $finecolor robe with gold plaques~
A long, flowing $finecolor robe decorated with gold plaques is draped out on the ground.~
   This long $finecolor robe drapes loosely over the wearer's 
form, falling in loose folds of coloured linen which end just 
above the wearer's ankle. It fits comfortably about the neck 
without actually touching it, the garment's design leaving a 
small gap. Its natural cut aside, it is kept closed by a belt 
about the waist, and, though the long edge of the robe is simply 
sewn, the bottom edge of the robe, a wavy cut to it, falls into a 
light fringe of bronze-threaded tassels, short enough so as, in 
most cases, not to pick up dirt from the ground. Along the outer 
seams, thin plates of engraved gold are sewn, placed close 
together about the neck and just above the bottom fringe, and 
more distantly spaced along the vertical edge.

a finely-woven, $finecolor linen shawl stitched with polished gold plaques~
A finely-woven $finecolor linen shawl is here, gold plaques gleaming.~
   Woven into complex, if abstract, patterns, the background 
colour and that of the patterning are defined primarily by the 
wide band of solid colour which runs the outside length of the 
$finecolor shawl. Made to rest across the shoulders and wrapping 
around to tie off in front, or hang down in trailing ends in 
front of the wearer should vigorous movement not risk losing the 
garment, it is cut to hang down in a triangle over the wearer's 
back, and rises up to just above elbow-height as it reaches the 
sides for minimal restriction of movement. A large, oval-shaped 
gold plaque, engraved with a single animal, is centred between 
the wearer's shoulders, and a number of smaller plaques, each 
bearing a symbol of their own, are set around the shawl's edges.

A felt cape with leather trim lies in a heap.~
   This felt cape is a a light grey in colour, made of two 
layers; the outside is a firmer fabric, and a softer felt lines 
it within. Around the edges, the cape is framed in matching 
leather, protecting it from excessive wear and tear; the bronze 
broach which keeps it closed bears only simple ornamentation. 
The one concession to decoration is the embroidery, threads of 
bronze and bright reds and blues tracing patterns against the 
grey background.

   Sturdy yet comfortable, these slippers have likely seen some

sturdy, but a softer leather lines them within. While, for the 
most part, they are plain in appearance, bands of decorated 
leather runs over the top just in front of the ankles, bronze 
threads running decorative lines in the leather up to where the 
bronze buckles sit, allowing the strap to be adjusted to the 
wearer's foot.

   These slippers, made of a soft, pliable leather, are just 
loose-fitting enough to be comfortable without sliding around on 
the foot, although running in these would likely lead to 
accidentally leaving them behind. Designed for comfort, the soft 
soles muffle the wearer's footsteps, and a few small plates of 
gold, each with its own engraving, adorn it, a slightly larger 
plate resting atop the toe of each shoe, a small golden animal 
figurine rising from it.

A conical hat arrayed with dangling bronze ornaments sits here.~
   This tall hat begins in cap set to fit the curve of the head, 
but rises up in a squat peak, forming a near perfect circle of 
stiff fabrics that keep their rigid shape via thin bands of 
bronze running around the diameter and inward towards the center 
of the gently-sloping cone, coming together at the point. 
Resting at the very top of the hat is a thin plate of burnished 
bronze in the shape of an animal. While a few animal-shaped 
bronze plates adorn the majority of available surface. And 
finally dangling from a host of bronze wires threaded through the 
brim are a multitude of bronze trinkets, some in the shape of 
animals while others are simply discs engraved with symbols.

   This grey-brown fur coat is lined with soft fur, the same 
within as without, and falls to just past mid-thigh on a 
well-fitted wearer. While it would do little against rain or 
extreme cold, it nonetheless is of a comfortable design, and is 
sufficient to keep one warm in a strong wind. On each shoulder 
rest bronze decorations, a trail of smaller plaques each with 
their own shape and engravings trailing down the arms.

   This cap has been crafted of soft leather, still bearing the 
unobtrusive tan of the original materials. Resting easily atop 
the head, its construction is far from complex, though the disc 
of bronze at its centre, raised slightly to be more visible, is 
more so, a variety of patterns, both stylized images and more 
abstract designs, etched into its surface. Around its lower edge 
are a series of bronze plates, each bearing a single image in its 
centre.

   This thick, heavily decorated leather belt is entirely without 
a buckle, instead having a loop at one end through which it can 
be passed and looped about again, allowing it to be worn without 
hiding any of the work which went into its construction save the 
small portion in the loop itself. Although free from images, 
various indented lines run along its length, splitting off at 
points and some joining once again, while others end in loops or 
spirals, others simply tapering off, while shorter lines or dots 
appear and disappear. A row of bronze studs run along both edges 
of the belt.

   This belt has been crafted of dark leather, forming a sharp 
contrast with its buckle, which has been crafted of horn and 
polished to a smooth finish. When worn as intended, it wraps 
twice around the waist, once, tightly, to keep it and any loose 
clothing beneath it in place, and a second time, hanging down one 
side, with a small leather loop built into its length, capable of 
bearing a weapon or sheath. While far from fancy, it is sturdy, 
functional, and obviously well-made.

   This long linen garment is loosely-fitted, displaying an 
excess of fabric about the abdomen and widening beneath the 
waist, where it is belted. Beneath the belt, the sides of the 
tunic part just above mid-thigh, the narrow triangular incisions 
allow a greater freedom of movement, while the sleeves narrow 
slightly as they approach the wrist, making them less likely to 
catch. The garment is heavily embroidered, images set against 
the fabric while various lines of thread trace the spaces 
between.

   This thin $finecolor cap fits itself to the skull, coming down 
to just above the start of the spine in the back and just above 
the eyebrows in front. The edges beneath are more or less level, 
lowering perhaps slightly towards the back, and, in the centre, 
meet a pair of ear-flaps which hang well past the ear and angle 
forwards along the wearer's jaw, a thin bronze plate at the bend 
both providing decoration and structural support. A band of 
bronze runs along the forehead, emphasizing the effect of the cap 
framing the wearer's face.

set likewise about both edges for decorative reasons, this bracer 
extends from wrist to elbow. Though clearly designed with the 
protection of the wearer's forearms from the fletching of arrows 
fired, and durable in design, these dark brown leather bracers 
are soft enough to prevent much discomfort, and the ornate bronze 
embroidery which traces patterns across its surface, together 
with the studs, make it ornamental as well as practical.

   This undyed jerkin is a simple affair, consisting of three 
pieces of brown leather which have been sewn together, the seams 
running up both sides and across the shoulders. The piece of 
leather in the front left extends slightly more than halfway, a 
row of buttons down the right side fastening it shut. The 
leather is sturdy but flexible, made to last through everyday use 
without hindering the wearer's movement. While the thread used 
in its construction is of a tough, non-metallic substance, 
perhaps cured sinew, bronze threads trace patterns against each 
of the three segments.

   These leggings are of a soft leather, rugged enough to survive 
the wear of time but clearly are designed more to keep one's 
pants from tearing while wading through dense scrub than they are 
to keep weaponry at bay. Extending from ankle to thigh, they are 
fitted closely to the leg, leaving just enough room for the 
bunches in the likely looser-fitting pants worn beneath. 
Decorative bronze threads run across their surface in abstract 
lines, adding a certain aesthetics to the functional design.

of patterned lines set between two vertical lines which run the 
height of the garment; down the front of the legs, each of which 
is a mirror of the other, are traced, stylistically and without 
excessive detail, the outlines of animals. At the waist, beneath 
whichever tunic it is worn beneath, it is fastened with sturdy 
cords fashioned from the sinews of some animal.

A heavy cloak of thick, dark fur is here.~
   Made from the hide of some large wild animal, or perhaps 
several joined together, this cloak is a dark brown, almost 
black, in colour. The thick, shaggy fur has a dull lustre to it, 
and, although the fur on the outside is far from the softest, it 
is undeniably warm - indeed, perhaps uncomfortably so, in the 
summer. Bereft of markings to identify the source animal, it has 
been trimmed so that the natural shape of the hides does not 
influence the cloak. Across the front, a sturdy bronze clasp 
keeps it shut, its heavily-engraved surface glinting.

   This regal cloak, originally made of linen but covered 
entirely with the golden wing-feathers of some large bird of 
prey, has evidently been made with great attention to detail, the 
even spacing and similar size of the feathers attesting to the 
time and skill invested in its making. The clasp is of matching 
detail, forged of bronze and heavily engraved, the etchings now 
bearing gold inlay. Bands of bronze run over the shoulders, and 
the cloak is trimmed with bronze as well, although the gleam of 
the metal is mostly obscured by the feathers.

   Reaching nearly to the knees, this coat is of a thick, dark 
brown leather, more than sufficient to keep out both wind and 
water. Within, the coat is layered thickly with wool, making it 
a bulky thing ill-suited to ease of movement, but perfect for 
keeping frigid weather, wind, and rain from the wearer. The 
buttons which keep it closed against the weather are carved of 
horn, likely the remnants from other uses. Thin plates of 
decorative bronze add further weight to the garment, each with an 
engraving of its own.

the leather wavy in some places, though no doubt, if the current 
wearer is the one to have broken these boots in, they fit 
comfortably on the feet. A pair of battered leather gaiters, 
held in place by a strap fitting the indentation forward of the 
bootheel, extend upward to just below the knee, protecting the 
wearer's clothing from hazards of the terrain.

leather and benefits from a deep cowl to protect the wearer

torso, where several silver buttons may be used to hold it

is not restricted. Upon the left breast of the garment, over 
where the heart would be, is sewn a metal plate about four inches 
long, in the form of a waxing crescent moon.

   Seeming nestled against the side of the mountain along one

tents and gaily painted wagons of a myriad different styles and 
manufacture. Noise and laughter seems to trickle out of this 
place at all hours and people come and go freely.

an enormous, bronze-adorned drinking horn~
An enormous, bronze-adorned drinking horn is here.~
   This enormous vessel has been carved from a single, mammoth 
horn taken from one of the wild kine of Araw, large even for one 
of that kindred. The horn itself, white in colour save for where 
it darkens near the tip, has been polished smooth, the brown 
nearly matching the bronze which adorns it. A thick band of 
bronze extends down the horn from the rim, about half again as 
wide as a man's hand, and covered in raised images of fighting 
men, their enemies both man and beast. The other end, where it 
tapers to a sharp point, has a bronze ring set about it about a 
handswidth from the point, below which the horn has been carved 
so that, if the horn is inverted, the tip resembles the head of 
an eagle. Between the two ends are set two similar, 
equally-spaced bronze bands, each of which bears more abstract 
but no less detailed patterning.

   This tighly-fitted shirt is made of fine, $finecolor linen. A 
'V' shaped neck exposing the upper chest with a thin leather cord 
loosely connecting the opened collar together. Long sleeves 
expand into wide-open flares, allowing for a contrast of baggy, 
draped linen over the wearer's wrist and fold back onto 
themselves to produce a stylish cuff. The hem on the bottom of 
this garment grazes the upper hip, not enabling it to be tucked 
in effectively into a belt.

is prominently adorned with the image of a waxing, crescent moon, 
made of bronze and riveted to the collar itself. The piece is 
hinged and designed to fit snugly about the neck of its wearer, 
though its appearance is somewhat decorative and could almost be 
mistaken for a piece of jewelry were it not for the sturdy lock 
at the back of the piece, making it exceptionally difficult to 
remove, once it has been fitted.

A hooded, moon-embroidered robe of black cotton lies here.~
   This floor length robe is made of good quality black cotton 
which is reasonably fitted about the torso, but flares out below 
the waist, allowing for ease of movement. It is a practical 
piece, with deep pockets for holding various small items. The 
sleeves are long and loose, though they can be easily gathered at 
the cuff if desired with small, silver buttons which hold the 
fabric out of the way of delicate work. The same buttons run up 
the length of the front of the robe, meaning it can be worn open 
or closed as desired. A large moon has been embroidered upon the 
left breast of the garment in a silvery thread, a striking 
embellishment to an otherwise plain piece.

an ironwood war-staff with flange-capped ends~
An ironwood war-staff with flange-capped ends is lying here.~
   This staff is fairly long, stretching well over seven feet. 
It is thick and weighty, giving it a very solid feeling heft. 
The ironwood shaft is generally smooth, allowing its user to 
shift grips with ease. However at several strategic points, 
carefully rounded bands of dark iron serve to both strengthen the 
weapon and provide for a superior grip. A quintet of dark iron 
flanges raise from caps of the same metal that encompass the 
final foot of each end. These flanges flare out suddenly at the 
ends of the weapon, peaking a couple inches in height as they 
hook slightly back towards the middle. The edge of the flanges 
has been keenly sharpened, creating crude but effective chopping 
edges designed to puncture and tear through armor.

   This leather cuirass is of truly massive proportions, far too 
large and heavy to be worn comfortably by most men. Made of 
thick, tanned mumakil hide, the leather itself has been treated 
and hardened so that it will provide a sturdy level of protection 
to it's wearer and buckles down each side to allow it to be 
fastened securely. Made with great care, large bones have been 
used to reinforce the piece, thick and held in place by iron 
bands at regular intervals, they have been riveted to the piece 
in a macabre recreation of the wearers own rib-cage, adding both 
impressive protective properties as well as weight to the piece.

   This enormous helmet is made of thick bronze which has been 
beaten into the form of a truly enormous helmet. Fitting only 
the very largest of men, the helmet appears battle scarred, with 
various dents and nicks upon it's surface, though the metal 
retains a high shine. Sharpened bone spikes protrude wickedly 
from it at various intervals, many of them stained with blood, 
making the piece appear truly formidable. A skirt of thick mumak 
hide has been riveted around the bottom of the helm, draping down 
as far as the wearers shoulders and stitched decoratively with 
fangs and shards of bone.

mumakil hide, the leather itself has been treated and hardened so 
that it will provide a sturdy level of protection to it's wearer 
and buckles on one side allow it to be fastened securely. Made 
with great care, a crescent moon formed of iron has been riveted 
to the piece. Several inches long, it is polished to a high

value to the piece.

a lions head beltpack~
A beltpack formed from the head of a large male lion lies here.~
   This cured beltpack has been fashioned from the head of a 
large male lion, the tawny fur of the great beast still glossy 
and soft. Its eyes have been removed and sewn shut and its mouth 
has been cunningly worked so it can be pulled closed with a 
drawstring. The inside has been crudely lined with common 
leather. The lions mane of thick, coarse dark fur hangs thick 
and low, well past the knees of any common man.

A dusky bronze orb inlaid with a jet-black stone threatens to roll away here.~
   This bronze This bronze orb is about the size of a walnut, 
though the solid metal means it is considerably heavier and has a 
good weight in the hand. Clearly very old the metal is dented 
and tarnished, though the care in it's workmanship is still 
evident. On one side, a jet-black stone has been set into the 
metal, there is a small chip in it but when new, this would have 
been a valuable and masterfully faceted gem.

   Standing life size at just over six feet in height, this 
marble statue is an artful recreation of a Gondorian Knight. 
Clad head to toe in platemail he stands sentinel outside the 
eastern doorway for all eternity, sword in his right hand, shield 
in his left. His face bears a peaceful expression, jaw set 
firmly while flowing locks fall with a slight curl to just above 
the figure's shoulders. Strangely however, the left eye of the 
statue would appear to be missing, a circular recess visible 
instead.

An altar of white marble stands here before a glass coffin containing a skeleton.~
   This altar of white marble was extravagant in it's day, 
exquisitely carved with ivy and flowers spiralling up it's legs 
and gilded with opulence while the top has been inlaid with the 
heraldry of Greathouse Aranin in intricately worked silver. It 
is set before a coffin made of glass, supported by a framework of 
silver within which rests the skeletal remains of a female, 
judging by the slight build and the few remaining strands of 
long, fair hair that remain upon her head. Death becomes her, 
her hands are folded across her chest and her gaze stares 
serenely into eternity.

opulent black velvet is now tattered and faded, rotting in the 
damp of the tomb after many years of neglect. The remains of 
silver embroidery in the form of curling and flowering vines and 
ivy can be vaguely discerned beneath many years of accumulated 
dust and grime. Utterly beyond salvage, they are a mournful 
sight indeed.

A black iron shoulder-guard emblazoned with a new moon lies here.~
   Consisting of black iron cast into the shape a simple kite 
shield, this armguard covers the entire upper arm of the wearer, 
from the point of the shoulder to the end of the tip of the 
elbow. While it is rounded and padded on the inside with thick 
straps to attach it to the arm, the outside is cast to accentuate 
the edges of the shield with an inch-thick border rising from the 
metal, while emblazoned in the centre of the guard is a circular

illuminated part of the lunar phase is clearly visible as it is 
cast from the iron completely, contrasting against the lightly 
etched dark portion of the phase which completes the disc-like 
shape.

from its waistband, which is decorated with an assortment of 
rich-hued feathers while a trio of silver buttons fasten it 
securely and with a decorative flair. The hem has been decorated 
an abstract pattern of swirling embroidery and even more 
feathers, causing the bottom of the garment to flare out

A frayed, feathered skirt of black and $color has been left here.~
   One could imagine this skirt was constructed of little more 
than scraps of other fabrics, the edges left raw to fray with 
time, were it not for their artful arrangement and the obvious 
care that has gone into the construction of this piece. 
Fashioned in a decidedly foreign manner from an assortment of 
fine linens, decoratively frayed, overlapping strips comprise the 
body of this skirt. Some are dyed a $color hue, though most are 
jet-black, producing a striking contrast. The strips are not 
joined or sewn together and swish back and forth with every 
movement of the wearer, revealing flashes of the legs beneath. 
An assortment of rich-hued feathers are decoratively sewn down 
the left hem of the garment and disguise the trio of silver 
buttons which hold the piece closed.

both warm and sturdy while the weight of the cloak suggests the 
outer layer is perhaps from the hide of a fox or other similar 
animal, the luxurious fur dyed black. What is certain is that 
many long, raven-hued feathers have been sewn, fixed and fretted 
into the cloak, even the hood. A highly decorative piece, a 
silver clasp fastens it at the neck, holding the enveloping folds 
of this garment in place.

   Well made from the delicate scales of this thin snakeskin 
dress each hold a fine gloss apperaing rich, vibrant and well 
looked after. It bares no sleeves or strapping about the neck 
instead swooping a across the bust as it clings to the wearers 
curves fashioned as a second skin. The hem falls to the wearers 
ankles while the length has a deep split to the left side 
allowing flashes of skin to be seen with the slightest of 
movement. An assortment of rich-hued feathers have been fixed to 
the waist in a decorative fashion just above the split. For all 
of its atheistic beautify and attractiveness, it is quiet thin 
and wouldn't offer much warmth in the winter months.

mumakil and range anywhere from fifteen to twenty five inches. 
Reinforced steel has been rimmed around the top and set into

been carefully capped with steel ensuring its usually dangerous 
jaggered tip is now flat and smooth. Some horns bear thongs 
allowing them to be slipped onto a belt whilst other hold a long 
braided shoulder strap.

Nevertheless, it seems sturdy enough to hold an ample amount of 
goods, the shelves deep enough to allow even larger items to be

of shattered skulls of some humanoid creatures, quite possibly 
Men. Grimy in appearance, this necklace is a grisly example of 
sheer yrch brutality.

length and is finished along its edge with a weighted fold, 
intended to hold the cloak down regardless of the weather. Clear 
upon its back is the burned mark of a barbed hammer held aloft.

entirely of one sheet of iron. Beaten in to the rough shape of a 
head and fitted with a stiff cage by heavy studs, it serves its 
purpose well, protecting the skull and most of the face. Upon 
its top, two crude horns have been fitted, one a couple of inches 
higher than the other, though both rising at least a hands length 
in to the air above.

its back, bold and striking against the dirt that clings to the

stone, each slightly different from the others in their details. 
There are no decorative touches to these thrones, they are plain, 
unadorned, full of sharp angles and certainly not too 
comfortable. The backs of the seats rise high, seeming to add to 
the height of anyone seated in them.

a wrought-iron, cage-headed warhammer~
A dark iron warhammer lies here, the rear of its head hollow.~
   Made of dark iron, this warhammer serves a dual purpose. 
First it is a weapon for war with a head of toughened iron fixed 
by a copious amount of leather binding to a metal shaft. Its 
second is that of a torch or lantern. Upon the rear of the 
hammers head, wrought iron has been turned to allow the placement 
of a lantern, protected from the elements by a the thick bars of 
a cage. It's handle has been bound in old leather improving the 
grip somewhat. Upon the front face of the hammers head a smaller 
hammer as been etched crudely upon its front.

   A crooked length of a branch has been carved into the

meant for someone much shorter than a common Man. The entire

little room left smooth enough to grip it comfortably. A few 
short strips of leather hang from one end, some limp, discolored 
feathers attached to them.

   A short length of charred, fire-hardened wood has been shaped 
into a staff that seems about the right size for a smaller orc. 
A number of rust-eaten nails poke out of its ends, threatening to 
inflict some vile disease along with a painful wound from the 
bent points. A number of charms have been added to the staff, 
hanging from the nails on short strings, from bones to small 
stones. They emit a rattling, clattering sound when this weapon 
is being handled.

a gargantuan wooden onager~
A gargantuan wooden onager is stationed here.~
   This gargantuan automaton has been nailed together out of 
random logs and a few planks into a form resembling a siege 
weapon. The frame of this weapon is a massive fifty by fifty 
foot oblong square reinforced by its own sheer size that stands 
an additional five feet from the ground. Towards the back of 
this machine is a wooden pole which has been cut to fit inside 
the frame. On either side of this pole are two large spoked 
wenches used to pull back on a massive rope which has been 
wrapped and ran though the wooden pole and tightly attached to 
this beast of a weapon's throwing arm. The throwing arm of this 
weapon is litterly a trunk of a tall tree that has a large spoon 
attacked to one end. Towards the middle of the arm is a large 
metal loop allowing the rope from the attacked pole with the two 
wenches to be pulled back. At the base of the throwing arm and 
dead center of the onager is a mass of sinew stretched through 
two large holes on both sides of the frame, forced to reside in 
eternal strain by iron circular devices. The front of this 
Onager is a large raised block made out of five logs. The first 
two are nailed down and standing vertical with a third lying 
horizontal providing the stopping block for the throwing arm. 
While the last two logs have been nailed down to the supporting 
logs of the block act as much needed extra support and added 
weight to the stopping block in a crude attempt at keeping this 
weapon in one piece.

A polished-iron, tapering yatagan has been left here.~
   The blade of this yatagan tapers and arcs to a fine point in 
the fashion typical to this manner of weapon. This polished iron 
blade, the inside edge sharpened to a keen edge, has a shallow 
groove hollowed along its slightly curving length, likely to 
lighten the weapon. The blade joins to a silver-trimmed bronze 
hilt without a hand-guard though the pommel curves back up toward 
the blade in the shape of a cat-like claw. This weapon seems to 
have been crafted by a skilled metalworker, intricate knot 
designs worked in silver upon the darkened bronze hilt.

an ivory handled, polished-iron-bladed khukri~
An ivory handled khukri with a polished-iron blade lies here.~
   The iron blade of this khukri is nearly eight inches in 
length, one side sharpened to a razor-keen edge. The blade 
curves with this sharpened edge on the inside of the bend, so one 
would have to grip the ivory handle in an overhand manner to use 
the knife effectively. The hilt is just large enough to wrap one 
hand around and has been engraved with a scarab, darkened with 
red dye, on either side. A bronze pommel, shaped like a large 
cat-like claw, has been attached to the hilt to balance the 
weapon.

   Elongated and curving sharply, this monstrous instrument has 
been made out of dark, solid iron, hammered into shape somewhat 
unevenly. It narrows slowly towards the mouthpiece, which seems 
to be larger than usual, a ring of bone encircling it. More bits 
of ivory-colored charms and strips of hair wrap around the horn 
at seemingly random places, rattling and clattering when the item 
is being handled.

three small hands from the pale westerners. Gondorian, Dunedain,

tiny bells against the shield's rim. Sewn expertly to its front 
is the face of a pale Westman woman, set upon it as its standard. 
Her long blond hair, red stained and dirty from many battles, is 
inlaid with great skill. The mouth is open in a silent scream, 
the face frozen in a rictus of pain and suffering. Its eyes are 
squeezed tightly closed as if her face were removed slowly, 
expertly, over time.

A belt of woven sinew and bone lies here.~
   This belt is made entirely from bits and pieces of Men and 
animals. The belt itself is made from dozens of thick cords of 
sinew, tied in intricate braids and designs to give it strength

dangle from the belt's knots and rustle with every movement. It 
seems to be a collection of trophies or bits and pieces of large 
victories.

of which has been broken in half. The protective glass casing is 
a light green color with that being from dirt or an orginal tint 
undiscernable. Small cracks are all throughout the glass causing 
the light to flicker with any slight stir of a breeze. The flame 
has a greenish color except where one can see through the cracks 
and casts off a dim light for the surrounding area.

a light, linen-swathed vest of reinforced leather~
A light vest of reinforced leather lies here, swathed in natural-coloured linens.~
   Lengths of worn coloured linen cloth, mostly dark browns and 
drab greens, have been swathed around this tough leather in 
weaved patterns, causing a mixture of colour and some added 
protection. The cloth is frayed in and ripped in places, but is 
barely noticeable in the general knit around the leather vest. 
The vest itself is of a sturdy, flexible design. Critical parts 
have been doubled up with two layers of leather and then studded 
with roughened obsidian, taking care to not give off a shiney 
reflection. Overall, this vest is a light piece of protective 
armour, designed for stealthy movement and to aide the unseen in 
the wilderness.

An obsidian chalice with razor sharp edges is set here.~
   Made from a large chunk of obsidian, this two handled chalice 
is deep and seems to have been carved by hammer and chisel. The 
material is razor-sharp at its edges, perilous to the touch and 
thus lacks the smooth curves of a finished item. Runes and 
phrasings in the dark tongue crisscross its base and glow a 
sickly green in the ambient light. 
   Within the chalice gems glow dully as if spent from some
exertion of energy.

twining black thornbush frozen orc SHAMAN-PLOT VEGETATION~
a twining black thornbush fused with a frozen orc with pain etched on his face~
A twining, black thornbush grows wild here, fused with a frozen orc with pain and longing etched over his features.~
   Thick black vines twine around each other in a twisting 
sprawling bush. The bark is slick and so darkly black that light 
seems to disappear. There is no leafy growth nor flowers upon 
this vine, but it seems to live with a sickening heartiness that 
lends malice to the bush. Sharp spikes spanning the size of a 
fingernail to the length of a man's arm jut out from the vines 
which worm around each other, the very darkness making them 
appear to writhe and move except when you look directly upon 
them. Knotted black roots gnarl up out of the ground to trip the 
unwary and leech further life from the ground. 
   Most noticeable however, is the creature which appears to have 
been fused with the thorn bush. What was once a starkly 
white-skinned orc has become part of the thorn bush, frozen in 
time with its body wracked in pain, a long of fear and longing 
etched over its facial features. The black veins grow over the 
orkin, as if to claim it as part of the bush in whole.

cuirass UNIQUE-BLOODWATCH-pZAGDULA gruesomely designed orkish blackened steel byEldritch METAL~
a gruesomely-designed orkish cuirass of blackened-steel~
Left here on the ground in a blackened-steel cuirass, is gruesome design and construct obviously of orkish origin.~
   Intimidating is an understatement when describing this 
gruesome and effective piece of orkish armour, providing not only 
the chest, back and shoulders with a thick layer of protection, 
but offering a heinous display of ingenuity and cruelty. 
Blackened steel has been forged into two thick pieces, engraved 
with orkish battle runes and sigils, most noticeably a bleeding 
eye pierced by a thorn on each breast of the front section. The 
two rotten fur-lined, steel plates have been connected together 
via a series of blackened chain which run through the shoulders, 
while a separate set run around the sides of the plate. This 
simple, yet clever, system not only allows the plates to be 
tightened to the wearer's form, but wrap around the cuirass to 
add to its orkish appeal and protection. Additionally, 
blackened-steel pauldrons have been affixed to the upper set of 
chain to provide effective cover to the shoulders, each lined 
with three steel talon-like spikes that flare outward wickedly. 
While the two steel plates cover the front, back, and shoulders 
with a layer of black steel, the sides of the wearer are left 
revealed by a small gap in the metal. These two sections have 
been reinforced with meshs of black orkish maille, affixable with 
grimy steel links to the cuirass.

A set of blackened-steel vambraces have been left carelessly here, lined with glinting, razor-sharp barbs.~
   These orkish vambraces, made to be worn on the arms, are 
forged of sleek, blackened-steel. The dark metal is set with a 
series of sharp razorlike barbs, varying in lengths and glinting 
cruelly in the light, that assure pain to the foe of whomever 
wears them. The articulated joints are carefully made and 
well-greased, allowing for superior flexibility despite the 
rigidity of the dark steel. The metal has been lined with 
stinking, rotten animal fur, providing a padding for the thick 
layer of metal. A deep engraving of a bleeding eye, pierced by a 
long thorn, has been placed on the upper section of each 
vambrace.

A pair of brass-trimmed, polished steel greaves have been laid here.~
   This set of blackened-steel greaves are quite gruesome and 
grim in appearance, cruelly-bladed barbs set along their lengths 
viciously. The dark metal glints dully in light, assuring 
superior protection and mobility with its carefully crafted and 
well-greased articulated joints. The layer of metal has been 
lined with rotten animal fur, providing a liner to the steel for 
the comfort of the wearer. While their primary design is to be a 
piece of armor, these greaves would no doubt also serve as a 
wicked means to deal out pain to a foe. Etched deep into the 
metal of the each greave is the image of a bleeding eye, pierced 
by a wickedly curved thorn.

A pair of hideously-spiked gauntlets made of blackened steel have been left here, tipped with long cruel claws.~
   Well-greased and articulated, these blackened-steel gauntlets 
are affixed with serious of long fierce-looking spikes lining the 
outer side of the forearm viciously. Razor-sharp metal blades 
protrude talon-like from a steel band covering the top of the 
hand, and wickedly-barbed extensions forged to the tips of the 
fingerpieces. The steel is dark and polished, and efficiently 
forged. The gauntlets flare at the cuffs, allowing them to be 
worn in conjunction with other armor. Each gauntlet has been 
engraved with the orkish sigil of a pair of bleeding eyes, each 
pierced with a long wicked-looking thorn.

   Greasy, black-leather boots make up the base of this piece of 
effective orkish foot armour, and the leather soles allow for 
ease of travel. Plates of blackened-steel have been placed 
strategically along portions of each boot, hideous-looking spikes 
of dark steel flaring outwardly to provide a nasty means of 
delivering pain to a foe. Black leather thongs can be pulled to 
tighten the fit of the boots tighter to the wearers feet and

A stark black-steel helm with a warmask front has been left here, the helm-piece adorned with sharp barbs.~
   Crafted starkly of blackened steel, glinting dully in light, 
this conical helmet protects much of the head save the face, 
which is covered by a warmask comprised of two large twin-barbed 
hooks of steel and black maille meshing. Only the area around 
the wearer's eyes can be seen through the metal masking, looking 
out from of the rims of the steel barbed hooks, the rest of the 
face veiled with the attached maille mesh. The helm itself has 
been forged with sharpened barbs placed randomly along it's 
surface, a cruel-looking embellishment to the head piece. An 
engraving of a sigil has been etched on the back of the helm, 
surrounded by barbs, depicting a bleeding eye pierced by a 
wicked-looking thorn.

A sigil-engraved gorget of blackened-steel, rimmed with steel barbs, has been left on the ground here.~
   This blackened steel gorget is wrought in two pieces of steel 
platemail, clasping with well-greased buckles at the side. It is 
rimmed with back-to-back steel barbs, sharp and flaring out from 
the wearer's neck and chin, designed to protect against the blows 
of an assailant and to look very fierce. A lining of rotten 
animal fur lines the inner steel, providing a layer of softer 
material between the dark metal and the wearers skin. The very 
front of the gorget is barbless, as it has been saved for an 
engraving of a dark sigil. A pair of eyes have been etched into 
the darkened steel, each pierced with a wickedly depicted thorn, 
dripping droplets of what is presumably blood down the front of 
the gorget.

A pair of blackened-steel maille sleeves have been left here.~
   Tarnished, blackened-steel chain links form sheets of black 
maille, covering and affixed to a set of greasy-leather sleeves

A double-layer of swathed black maille has been built into the 
upper-arm part of each sleeve, designed to give additional 
protection to the armpits and shoulders.

A shirt of blackened maille has been set here, covered with a grimy tabard.~
   This short-sleeved shirt of maille has been formed by 
countless individual blackened-steel chains linked together; to 
be precise, each chain is linked to another four. Despite the

shirt, such as the chest and shoulders, have been reinforced with 
a double layer of the black maille, and the whole piece bears a 
filthy padded gambeson liner. Covering the maille shirt is a 
very grimy dark-crimson tabard, a crude orkish sigil emblazoned 
on it's front and back in thick, haphazard stitching. The sigil 
depicts the image of a bleeding eye that has been pierced by a 
wicked looking thorn.

feathers, affixed by long strands that bear other crude 
adornments such as fingerbones, grisly beads, and small animal 
skulls. A deep cowled hood has been sewn to the cloak, totally
