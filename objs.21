   This thick band is formed of reflective steel, polished to 
almost mirror like qualities. It is the same quality steel that 
the great masters of the Fellowship of Weaponsmiths use in their 
making of the fine blades of Gondor's armies. The band of steel 
is thick and strong, nearly half a centimetre wide, as it sweeps 
from one side of the ring to the other. In the centre is a solid 
steel sword, brightly burnished, and with a tip so finely cut 
that it would likely draw blood if an errant finger were pricked 
by it. The ring is a symbol of the mastery of weaponsmithing.

the thumb, enclosing most of the knuckle. The bulbous top 
section of the ring is sheared off flat, and upon it is stamped a 
bulky, many-toothed gear, the symbol of apprenticeship in the 
Fellowship of Engineers.

A lily capped, thin gold ring lies here.~
   The golden lily atop this ring seems to grow out of the band 
itself, opening up delicately from the base. The flower is done 
in great detail, the stamen of the flower set amongst the 
miniature petals. The band itself circles from one side of the 
lily to the other, tapering down from each side to connect at the 
thinnest point beneath. The lovely flower is a fitting symbol of 
the Fellowship of Horticulturists, responsible for the care and

   The golden band of this ring is fairly plain, though well 
crafted, the metal strong and polished to a light reflecting 
sheen. The part of the ring that more obviously draws the eye, 
however, is the exquisitely detailed tankard, symbol of the 
Fellowship of Hostelers, that has been skilfully joined to the 
bronze hoop, hardly a weld visible. The tankard is an image of 
the standard pewter tankard found in any one of the hundreds of 
inns in Gondor, and is detailed right down to a small bit of foam 
slipping over the brim. The gold of the ring shows that the 
bearer has earned the title of master in the fellowship.

   This finely crafted battlesword has seen better days. Its

a razor-sharp edge.

A keen, wide bladed broadsword rests here.~
   This broadsword, made from polished iron, has been crafted by 
a master's hands. Its blade, long and wide, has been sharpened 
to a point that is razor-like. The blade is the width of one 
hand and has a blood groove running the length from just shy of 
the point to the crossguard. A heavily-dulled grey crossguard 
connects the blade with a long solid wooden hilt that is as long 
as two and half hand widths and has been wrapped in black leather 
for additional grip. The hilt features a large, rounded dull 
grey pommel which gives the blade perfect balance

A brown pair of circular pieces of leather lie here.~
   Made of supple leather, these vambraces were designed to cover 
the wearer's arms from the shoulder down to the forearm in a snug 
fit. Rigid courboulli leather has been riveted onto the shoulder 
area as well as the upper arm, forearm, and a round cup to

shorter than the other to allow the wearer a bracer for archery. 
They have been left undyed, brown in color.

   This thick leather courboulli hauberk has been left undyed, 
the leather brown in color. It is functional and this armour

closer to the wearers hips and waist, allowing for freedom of 
movement.

upper arm, forearm, and a round cup to protect the elbow, 
allowing for ease of movement and as much protection as can be 
provided. The left vambrace appears to be shorter than the other 
to allow the wearer a bracer for archery .

A well-made hauberk of $color courbouilli lies here.~
   This thick leather courboulli hauberk has been artistically 
dyed a rich $color. As much a work of art as it is functional, 
this armour serves to offer lightweight protection to its wearer 
as well as camouflage while in the wilds. It wraps around the 
wearer's body snugly, and is well padded on the inside to promote 
comfort and to turn away penetrating blows. The leather softens 
as it moves closer to the wearers hips and waist, allowing for 
freedom of movement.

A brushed steel breastplate emblazened with two golden coins lies here.~
   Shaped from steel, bent and softly hammered, this breastplate 
provides its wearer with superb protection of the chest and 
torso. It curves hard over the back of the shoulders, attaching 
with rivets to a chain and leather backing, allowing it to be 
easily worn and fexible to movement. Its surface has been ground 
to offer a brushed look, more easily hiding scratches or blemish. 
While an outstanding piece of craftsmanship, a few hammer blows 
can be seen under close inspection. Centered on the sternum, two 
small golden coins have been hot-hammered into the armor.

   Sable black in color, this ribbon has been expertly stiched 
into a diamond shape. Its threading has been done in blood-red, 
standing out in contrast to the dark silk it holds together. Its 
shape allows it to be worn over the head, with the top of the 
diamond shorter then the bottom. Worn properly, both sides would 
come to points over the shoulders, and the bottom point would 
hang low on the chest. Attached to the bottom point is a small 
golden jewel that has been shaped beautifully into two golden 
coins.

   Style, materials, and color were all taken into account by the 
craftsman of this dapper looking hat. Its black, soft velvet has 
been stiffened by wooden inserts to keep its form as intended. 
The left side of the wide brim has been tucked against the 
circular middle with a small golden rivet, while the right side 
hangs outward, in stark contrast to its partner. Tucked in 
between the material on the left is a large, $finecolor feather 
plume that arcs backwards for a drastic flare. Obviously 
intended for wealthy buyers, every stitch and fold has been done 
with careful precision.

slightly to fit a wall. The cherry-wood planks used to fashion 
the steps have been stained and polished, then covered with a 
soft gold carpeting running up the center. Lathed pieces of

A long, mahogany dining table is here, carved on the edges in vines and coins.~
   Made with skill only a master woodworker could muster, this 
dining table is an example of prime craftsmanship. It is very 
long, enough to accomidate up to twelve people, ten on both 
sides, and one at each end. The wood is mahogany, sanded, 
stained, then laquered to a bright polish. The edges have been 
carved into coins and vines, entertwining beautifully around the 
entire table. Eight posts so simple, planed lumber hold up this 
table, offering strngth, but adding quite a bit of weight to an 
already heavy object.

a lustering, wicked looking poleaxe with a $finecolor tassle~
A poleaxe is here with a recurved axe-head and attached with a $finecolor tassle.~
   Attached securely to a dark-stained oaken shaft, this polearm 
stands higher then an average man. At the top of the shaft, an 
axehead rests, recurved at the bottom into a wicked, hand-length 
gaff. On the back of the head, a thick, conical spike protrudes 
backwards. For all intents and purposes, a heavily armored man 
on horseback would be the prime target of this storied weapon, 
though it could be just as deadly to someone on foot. The steel 
of the cutting edges apprears almost like rippled water, hinting 
at a different process of forging then just casting. A 
$finecolor tassle has been securely attached with small steel 
chain just below the axehead. A normal eye would know the metal 
is steel, and highly-polished at that.

A blood-red cloak lies here, its edges and embroidery done in gold threading.~
   This cloak has been made of luxurious, soft wool dyed 
blood-red in color. Its hood is overly large, folding back onto 
the shoulders even if worn properly, and made to conceal the 
wearer's face from wind and weather. Squarely between the 
shoulders, midway-down the back side, two medium golden coins 
have been embroidered expertly into the fabric. Along the edges, 
a thin dental of golden linen has been expertly stitched in 
matching thread, to attach the ends of the wool to the interior 
lining. The lining is black linen, fine in its quality - many 
threads woven together to form the fabric. If one were to spit 
wool from linen, a thin piece of oiled leather could be found 
between them, keeping warm and dry the owner of this masterfuly 
sewn cloak.

Through the work of an expert craftsman, this chainmail
coif has been interwoven through several thin pieces of leather
nullifying the loud sound while moving in it. A relatively spherical
shape when opened, the face of this piece is open to the air.
Around the entire piece, a second layer of leather has been wrapped
and interwoven. Greens and browns have been put in a pattern
on this coif, allowing its wearer to blend into forested areas
more easily. Across the bottom half of the coif, a piece of patterned
hide has been attached. It has fasteners on either side, so it may
be partially or completely removed. When worn completely,
most individual's mouths and noses would be concealed.

It has been crafted from a solid piece of steel, thick and 
strong. The workmanship is masterful, yet yery simple. A piece 
of steel has been bent around the sides, and over the shoulders, 
outlining the body in a hard chassis. Straight down the stern of 
the armor, a few small runaic characters are etched deeply into 
the steel.

An articulated cuirass lies here, crafted of masterful hands.~
   With a degree of craftsmanship at the epitomy of 
armorsmithing, this piece has been worked from many pieces of 
steel. The first layer, forming a collar around the shoulders 
and neck has been fashioned to allow the chest muscles to flex, 
being a slightly expanded form of the same. Underneath that, and 
at the bottom of the first piece, overlapping bands of steel have 
been stuck together at a parallel, and wrap around the torso. 
They have been affixed in the back to a slightly curved, fluted 
backpiece by way of sturdy chain links. Pauldrons of the same 
design are affixed at the shoulders with a similar design, 
combined with blackened leather. Between what joints exist, 
kingsmail webs in, each link riveted to each other. While some 
sacrafice of mobility is a given, the wearer would be granted a 
superb amount of protection. The entire piece has been 
clay-polished to a satin sheen.

a blued-steel, tightly-knit mail hauberk~
A pile of blued-steel rings is here, tightly knit together.~
   This mail hauberk has been crafted with the utmost skill and 
care. Akin to a standard shirt of steel mail, this hauberk has 
one noticable difference in design; instead of one ring running 
through another, and so on, four rings run through two others. 
While normal mail may be protective, this design ensures that 
there are no weak points in battle. Only imaginable is the time 
it would take to create such an object, the mere time consumed 
would be near triple, if not quadruple the normal chain piece. 
Only the highest degree of master most likely completed this 
shirt, as the difficulty in its construction is vast. Each link 
has been blued. The chain garment covers the upper arms, 'V's 
down at the neck, covering the chest, and dipping low to cover 
and protect the groin. The chain is so tightly linked, and 
pressed together, it seems impossible for a man's hands to have 
created this masterful work.

blued-steel, tightly-knit mail sleeves~
A small mound of blued-steel rings is here, tightly knit together.~
   Blued steel rings make up these mail sleeves, linked together 
in a rather tight series of four to two, over and over again to 
finish the piece. So tight knit are the rings, that it makes 
normal chain seem thin, and borish of design. To create this 
piece, much time would have been put into it, and only a master's 
time would do, due to the difficulty in tapering the sleeves to 
an arm in such a pattern. High tempature has cooked the steel 
used to a blued-hue which apprears almost black in low light. 
The chain is so tightly linked, and pressed together, it seems 
impossible for a man's hands to have created it.

a hefty barbute helm with thick, reinforced edges~
A solid barbute helm with reinforced edges has been left here.~
   Solid, thick steel has been used to create this helmet. 
Strangely, instead of using strips of metal to reinforce the 
edges, thick bands have somehow been affixed around the bottom, 
the center slit, and around the eye holes. One band has somehow 
been bent from the top, straight down the back, and another on 
each side. Attempting to crack this helmet might just likely end 
up in a cracked weapon, if not shattered. Inside, soft pieces of 
leather provide comfortable padding, and a chinstrap, if needed. 
This helm has been designed to cover not only its wearer's head, 
but most of the neck as well, down to a cuirass.

the craft would have to have spent a countless amount of time 
piecing together these gloves. Unlike normal mail, with each 
link fitting with the next, four links connect through two, 
offering outstanding protection. The metal has been blued by 
extreme heat.

a slender, white-washed chimney~
A slender, white-washed chimney protrudes from the roof.~
   Built with a wooden frame, then lined with river rock to keep 
from starting a blaze, this chimney is of no special 
craftsmanship. It protrudes from the rooftop near the height of 
a man, and when in use heat and smoke rise from the inside. The 
hole in the center is just big enough for the smallest of chimney 
sweeps to fit in.

a siazable, granite chimney~
A sizable chimney protrudes from the rooftop, constructed of granite.~
   Very large in size, this chimney must lead to a very large 
fireplace. It has been framed in wood, then set with large 
granite blocks to complete the chase. While not opulent or rich 
in design, it is functional and sturdy. The vent is large enough 
to fall into, should one not be so careful while standing on its 
lip.

a $finecolor, arabesque-designed robe with a deep cowl~
A cowled, $finecolor robe with a complicated arabesque design is here.~
   Fantasticly stiched in a design of animals and foilage, this 
robe is easily noticed as a fine piece of clothing. The 
emboridery has been carefully worked in sable-black threading. A 
deep cowl of the same design has been attached at the shoulders, 
and when not in use, layers back onto the neck. While a 
beautiful, velvet cord has been crafted to sit and tie at the 
waist, it is less functional then ornamental. Instead, a pin 
around the throat is intended to be worn and hold shut the piece. 
The inner lining is made of sea-grey silk, carefully tucked in at 
the edges under folds of the outer velvet.

warhammer EXPERT_QUALITY DWARVISH_QUALITY steel imbued bears roaring pElungwen old blued METAL~
an old, imbued steel warhammer~
An old steel warhammer has been set here, head imbued by two vicious bear heads.~
   Magnificent would be the only word to describe this shortened 
warhammer. A massive block of steel, conditioned to a point 
where it almost appears watery in color - a soft silvery blue, 
rests atop a shortened shaft of stained, ageless oak wood. On 
either side, where the flat of the warhammer is used for 
crushing, two bears are modeled with the finest of care and 
detail - both of them in the instance of an aggressive roar. 
Their massive mouths are frozen open, thick lips curled 
backwards, teeth exposed with vicious intent. Four eyes, between 
the two, are replaced with small, glistening emeralds, roughly 
cut, but nevertheless beautiful. A steel prong adorning the 
block has been fixed for lunging and impaling enemies, deadly to 
the tip. Thin bands of gold coil around the handle, separating 
the intentional gripping space from the rest of the rune-covered 
shaft.

A finely crafted crimson-dyed leather hauberk is here, stamped with the image of a bird.~
   Made from quality hide, this piece of leather armor has been 
crafted by the hands of a Master. Tooled through the process of 
making courbouilli it is a light and partially inflexible 
hauberk. Across the entirety of its form, crimson-colored dye 
has been applied in an even and thorough coating. The center of 
the chest has been stamped carefully, leaving the clear and 
detailed indentations of a wing-spread falcon. The claws reach 
just below the chest portion, while the wing tips stretch out to 
the shoulder areas.

simplicity and functionality in mind. The form is just slightly 
squared, a simple T-cut in the visor providing a sufficient field 
of vision. At the same time this same cut still provides ample 
protection to the user's face. The helm is nearly devoid of all 
ornamentation, excepting the image of a dove rising from the 
breast of a hawk stamped into the neck of the helm.

would be quite impractical for every-day use. This piece is 
comprised of rows of overlapping steel bandsm fitted and set onto 
a leather backing. These sabatons offer a great deal of 
protection to the feet, while at the same time do litter to 
hinder movement of the foot.

the pieces designed to be able to deflect all but a direct blow. 
Protecting the forearm up to the upper arm, these vambraces have 
been paired with a set of rerebraces. The joints are connected 
by a set of protective wings, designed to add extra protection to 
the vulnerable flesh it guards. Polished to a high shine, these 
pieces of armor have been carefully shaped and assembled in such 
a way to allow for a wide range of motion with little hinderance.

A pair of fine steel plate leggings have been set aside here.~
   These finely crafted pieces of armour provide an exceptional 
amount of protection to the wearer by encasing their legs 
entirely in reinforced steel. The cuisses, which cover the 
thighs, have been designed to buckle to a cuirass at the top. 
Another component of the armour guards the wearers groin. 
Covering the knees are steel poleyns, each of which curves 
outwards slightly to form an extremely strong, rounded cap over 
the knee. The poleyns join the cuisses and the greaves, 
protecting the lower legs right down to the feet from harm. One 
accustomed to wearing such armour would find the set relatively 
easy to move in, though their movements would still be hindered 
somewhat.

   Larger than an average satchel, this particular piece has been

this pack could likely resist a few pieces of sharp cargo. Its 
color is a midnight black, that compliments its embroidery well. 
Steel grey thread has been stitched over and over, forming a 
single blade across the flap of the satchel. A pair of bronze 
buckles secures the satchel, while a sturdy leather strap allows 
it to be either slung across the shouldler or across the back.

   The most noticeable feature of this solid helmet are the twin 
pair of runed cheekguards which extend down the length of the jaw 
line and near connect at the bottom lip. The visage portion of 
this helmet is open-faced, exposing the eyes and nose. At the 
helmet domes the skull, it sweeps back with an unmatchable 
smoothness, flattening to the shoulders to provide even extra 
protection. The iron itself is extremely well conditioned and 
very reflective - the artwork of a real master smith. The 
engravings are so well detailed, it seems impossible for a man's 
hands to have created it.

breastplate DWARVISH_QUALITY UNIQUE_PELUNGWEN ornate reinforced contoured iron METAL~
an ornate breastplate of reinforced, contoured iron~
An ornate breastplate of contoured iron has been set here.~
   This breastplate has been conditioned and fitted with the 
upmost care. The iron itself is very bright, polished to reflect 
a glossy sheen when exposed to light, natural or not. Leather 
and iron strips, layered strategically have been fixed to the 
inside, ensuring reinforced protection and comfort - allowing the 
wearer to articulate their movements without further hassle. 
Inscribed with great detail, on the front chest-piece, several 
ornately designed mountains overlap each other, their snow-capped 
peaks etched in a much darker hue. The engravings are so well 
detailed, it seems impossible for a man's hands to have created 
it.

solid crimson hue, including the tiny eagle stamp on each glove. 
Fingers have been removed from the gloves to allow an archer a

painting snow swept forest BYBONES UNIQUE_PMEERIYA OTHER~
a painting of a snow-swept forest~
A painting of a snow-swept forest is mounted to the wall.~
A great amount of fine detail has gone into this painting, the 
style of the artist distinct in the use of dark against light. 
The snow in the painting has a powdery quality to it, done overly 
soft.

While winter's pure undaunted white provides a soft blanket of 
light in a snow-swept forest, the portrait of a large evergreen 
nearest to the viewer is swathed in deep darkness. A stark 
contrast left to the eyes serves to shatter the flow of white. 
The owner of the shadow is a jet-black fox captured in a moment 
of pause. Muted silver rings the tip of the tail of the 
creature, branding it almost as pale as the landscape itself. 
The Hunter is caught in an alert stance, tufted ears puckered 
attentively and slender paw poised aloft. Ivory snow coats the 
toes of the paw, with the paint dappled and speckled over it in a 
feather-soft overlay that gradually vanishes into a blending of 
darkness further up its leg. While its fur is deep as night, the 
form is obfuscated, sunlight racing in a dim beam to shed 
luminance through the needle- branch above, lighting up its 
forequarters and seeming to tear it out of its hiding, out of the 
shadows.

painting horse rider BYBONES UNIQUE_PMEERIYA OTHER~
a painting of a statue of a horse and rider~
A painting of a statue of a horse and rider is here.~
   Viewed from below, the imposing quality of the statue upon 
this painting is made all the more prominent with the help of 
such an angle. Perched upon a base, which is barely visible with 
the angle chosen, is a warhorse whose form is adorned by 
battlegarb. Its neck arched and legs lifted in mid-trotting 
motion, the size of the hooves emphasized to further aid 
perspective. The stiffness of the mane and tail is brought out 
against the muted shades of the background, which are soft and 
blurred against the cold-coloured, smooth surface of the stone 
itself. Tiny cracks have been painted in at the base of the 
long, rectangular platform upon which it rests, speaking of old 
age. 
   The Rider is a man wearing platemail, his left arm strapped 
with shield that bears a tree painted solely in white. The 
colours of the shield are all paler than that of the rest of the 
statue, off-whites and soft grays. A winged crown resides upon 
his brow, while his face bears a stern expression that goes hand 
in hand with the august, if not regal crown. 
   Breaking the shades of grey, white, and black of the statue is 
a string of paper lanterns above, dangling on a thin rope. 
Colours bold and bright have been chosen for the paper against a 
black night sky. Ever slightly, a glow surrounds each one, 
denoting a candle burning within, just enough to aid with shadows 
and light upon the face of the rider below.

draping wall richly coloured BYBONES UNIQUE_PMEERIYA OTHER~
a richly-coloured wall draping~
A richly-coloured wall draping is here.~
   Sweeping colours saturate the expanse of this large wall 
draping. The subject matter is simplistic, although the use of 
lighting and tone is striking in its design. 
   Above thick clouds tumultuously tumble in a sky laboring with 
the weight of an impending storm. Some shards of light slip free 
from the oppressing heavens, raining down on the subject matter 
that is the focus point of the piece. 
   Collected upon an obfuscated hillside in the foreground which 
is at eyelevel with the viewer is a helm, a shield and a 
flagpole, all reminiscent of Gondorian craftsmanship. This trio 
bears a particular amount of detail that marks them the highlight 
of the piece. The luminance from above that brings it and the 
grasses about it to light is gentle yet strong, small dust mites 
dancing within the path of its fall. 
   Within the very backdrop of the piece, a mountain range looms, 
done so softly it might only be noticeable upon closer 
observation. One can easily take a closer #6look#0 at the detail of 
the #6sky#0, the #6mountain#0, the #6armour#0 or the #6banner#0.

A sultry painting of a nude young woman is here.~
    Soft illumination filters hazily over the focal point of this 
painting: a young woman reclining on her side upon a bed, 
features highlighted in the gentle glow catching her from above. 
The angle of the light makes the nubile curves of her body all 
the more prominent, the symmetric slide of sleek shoulder to 
slender waist and supple hips.
    Swirling strands of fine-spun gold are scattered over her 
shoulder, a single lock swiveling down to crash just over the 
roundness of a breast to strategically cover its center. Her other 
breast is hidden by a limber arm extended to rest exquisitely 
detailed fingertips over a goblet before her. Due to the use of 
perspective, the hand and goblet would appear to be closer to the 
viewer and by definition, larger. A great amount of detail has 
gone into the depiction of both.
   Supported by a propped up elbow, the young woman's head is 
resting within her cupped palm, free falling tendrils pooling 
out from in between her fingertips and chortling midway down to 
the mattress. Her facial features are delicate and shadow holds 
claim to its lower portions, softening the heart-shaped curve of 
her jaw into muted shades. In contrast, her brow and hair is 
caught by the light and due to this, the luminous hue of her eyes 
becomes the center point of attention on her visage, flecks of 
chartreuse and green mingled with each other. Her coral pink 
lips are curved into a small, almost coy smile while her eyes are 
tilted slightly down, as if looking upon the viewer. 
   One can easily take a closer #6look#0 at the detail of the 
woman's #6hand#0 or #6goblet#0.

an octagon. Carefully etched runes have been set into the band 
of the ring, forming a scrollwork.

an opulent clustered-diamond signet ring set in gold~
A band of gold set with six triangular diamonds has been left here.~
   Wrought from pure gold, this hand bears all of the marks of a 
Master Jeweller. The inner band has been gently rounded to give 
an easy fit and removal, while the outer has been slanted 
slightly on either side. Every part of the gold has been finely 
etched, sigils made in an ancient Numenorean mode. The top of 
the ring widens out into a circular platform, perfectly flat. 
Perfect, flawless diamonds have been cut into a triangular shape. 
They have been polished and laid in a hexagonal pattern. In the 
center of the jewels is a single sigil.

While fine linens make up the majority of the massive standard, 
the five pillars of the Houses are made of white silk, and 
stitched to appear seamless in the item.

little more than a few lengths of timber hammered together 
without care. Six unfinished planks make up its surface with a 
seventh and eighth running under it to keep them together. They 
are very rough to the touch and hold a sharp point on each 
corner. The legs themselves have been made in much the same way 
with long nails hammered through the surface of the wood to 
attach them. The chairs that surround it seem to be of better 
qualitiy, a few of them once having been varnished.

A wobbly fighting ring is secured to the ground here.~
   The ring, despite being wobbly and shaky, is of solidly made 
long lengths of wood that make up the corner posts. Thick strips 
of leather run along its sides creating the ring itself. It is 
raised upon legs a couple of feet off the ground. At one corner 
a few rough, uneven steps grant an easy passage inside the ring 
and on to a thick canvas mat. The mat itself is strong and has 
nearly no give to it, and it is smeared in the center with blood, 
beer and a few other unidentified fluids. Despite its ramshackle 
make it is sturdy and strong, though it has seen better times.

wood flaking, varnish fading and splinters rampant.

   This toddler is a chubby, tiny girl. Her smoke-colored eyes 
are bright and filled with wonder. Her head is covered with a 
cap of straight hair in ebon hue, reaching just to the bottom of 
her jaw. Her chubby fingers are quite dexterous and she is often 
caught fiddling with something, be it button, toy or her own 
hair. She is smaller than is perhaps normal, but perfect in her 
petiteness. Her skin is the color of fresh cream, tinged with 
rose across the swell of her cheeks, matching the pale pink of 
her lips. Her features are delicate and achingly sweet, a 
promise of great beauty yet to come.

his face has a thin quality unusual in such a young child. His 
lips, however, are rosy in hue and curve easily into a smile even 
in repose.

a tall obelisk bearing plaques~
A tall obelisk of black marble towers here, plaques flanking its side, etched with the many names of the fallen, picked out in gold.~
   This tall obelisk has been fashioned from black marble, 
polished to a high shine. It is mounted on a wide plinth, 
comprising on each of its sides three wide shallow steps. Below 
its sharply angled point, etched in relief into the stone, and 
whitened, is a carefully carved representation of the Tree of 
Gondor. Two of the monuments' sides are already covered with 
plaques bearing name after name carefully etched in Numenian 
Tengwar. Beside the monolith, aligned with one of its corners is 
a deeply carved round alabaster bowl, an arm's-span in diameter, 
and supported by another stylised representation of the White 
Tree. The smell of oil is present should one come close enough 
to the statue, probably eminating from the lightly golden liquid 
filling the bowl.

an old wreath with dead greenery~
An old wreath with dead greenery has been cast aside here.~
   Formerly a beautiful decoration, this wreath has dried out and 
withered. Made from the twisted boughs of some evergreen, the 
tiny needles now fall apart when pressure or movement acts upon 
it. Several dried and shrunken blossoms dot the wreath and 
rotting berries sag from their stems. A bow of scarlet red hangs 
from the bottom of the wreath and is in much better condition 
than the rest of it, albeit a bit faded.

a tall obelisk bearing plaques~
A tall obelisk of black marble towers here, plaques flanking its side, etched with the many names of the fallen. #9Gold and blue flames#0 flicker in a dish set beside the monument.~
   This tall obelisk has been fashioned from black marble, 
polished to a high shine. It is mounted on a wide plinth, 
comprising on each of its sides three wide shallow steps. Below 
its sharply angled point, etched in relief into the stone, and 
whitened, is a carefully carved representation of the Tree of 
Gondor. Two of the monuments' sides are already covered with 
plaques bearing name after name carefully etched in Numenian 
Tengwar. Beside the monolith, aligned with one of its corners is 
a deeply carved round alabaster bowl, an arm's-span in diameter, 
and supported by another stylised representation of the White 
Tree. The bowl's dish is filled with oil, #9surface alight with 
gold and blue flames#0.

gown delicately embroidered powder-blue blue sleeveless silk PLUCIUN UNIQUE_OLIZIA BySaladin TEXTILE~
a delicately embroidered, powder-blue, sleeveless silk gown~
An embroidered, powder-blue silk gown is left folded here.~
   This gown is of a simple yet elegant design. It has been 
beautifully crafted and well-fitted to the wearer. Powder blue 
silk has been used to fashion the bodice and top layer of the 
skirt. The modest straight neckline of the sleeveless bodice 
flows smoothly into narrow bands crossing the shoulders. The 
material dips slightly in the back and closes with a row of tiny 
silver buttons. Flaring over the hips, the blue silk covers a 
full skirt the reaches just to floor. A slight part down the 
middle of the skirt reveals layers of white silk underskirts. 
Following the hems of the dress is a delicate embroidered pattern 
of the same colored silk thread. The design is composed of 
interweaving lines almost runic in appearance enclosed between 
two borders.

silver thread. On the inside the cloak has been lined with 
silver silk. The garment is, overall, luxurious and exquisitely

A rigid, star-embossed breastplate has been left here.~
   As unique for its herald as for its construct, this masterful 
piece has been fitted with one wearer in mind. The breastplate 
is long and sharply tapers from broad shoulders to a trim waist, 
wrapping some around the ribs and belly. It is crafted of thin, 
rigid steel that has been blued to a color reminiscent of the 
sea. It's emblem dominates the fore of its broad chest, twelve 
stars with eight noble points detailed within a square. The 
stars, and the square, have been blackened to stand prominently 
against their blue background. It is set to be worn with a suit 
of the finest steel maille, its interlocking rings silvered to 
stand in handsome contrast to the breastplate.

sleeves UNIQUE_PGADRIL ByIarwain silvered steel maille METAL~
a pair of silvered-steel sleeves~
Left here lies a pair of silvered-steel sleeves of maille and plate.~
   Woven of a vast-number of small rings, these sleeves represent 
a Master's crafting of armored maille. The steel used in its 
construction has been silvered during forging to lend it a 
lustrous and aesthetically pleasing detail. The rings themselves 
are rigid and fine, forming a sheet of protection that is meant 
to end at the wrist of the wearer.

a thin, rigid vambrace of silvered-steel~
A thin and rigid vambrace of silvered-steel has been laid to rest here.~
   Crafted with a definitive, old world stylization, these pieces 
of armor have been forged by a Master's hand to invoke a spirited 
image of a former age. Thin pieces of strong, rigid steel mold 
to the wearer's forearm to protect from wrist to elbow, seated 
upon the interior with supple leather to ensure comfort. The 
flowing, fluid turns and angles give them a near-seamless 
appearance, adding to an antique aesthetic quality. Their 
expression is one of form meeting function, accented only by 
small emblems upon the backs of the wrists. Twelve stars with 
eight points stand raised from the sloping steel and have been 
darkened boldly with a blackening agent, filling the similarly 
designed borders of a square.

leggings UNIQUE_PGADRIL ByIarwain silvered steel maille METAL~
a pair of silvered-steel leggings~
Rumpled in a heap here lies a pair of silvered-steel leggings.~
   Belted at the top with a black-leather strap, these armored 
leggings are comprised of remarkably fine steel rings woven 
together to form a flexible, lightweight layer of protection. 
The steel has been silvered in the process of forging, lending it 
a particular luster and shine. The leggings are emboldened by 
thin, rigid steel shin-plates, contoured to fit the wearer's 
legs. In a style some make recognize as archaic, their border 
has been marked by a simple, but elegant fluted line designed to 
lend the plates a flowing, non-angular aesthetic value while 
simultaneously helping deflect impacts rather than absorb them.

collar UNIQUE_PGADRIL ByIarwain thin steel collar maille METAL~
a lightweight, thin collar of steel maille~
A thin collar of steel maille has been bundled in a small heap here.~
   Crafted of lightweight steel, this maille collar is formed by 
the woven face of many tiny rings that have been braced upon a 
simple cotton backing to provide a lightweight, breathable pad to 
the wearer's neck. The collar itself flows down to a curtain of 
maille that is designed to tuck into a breastplate or vest of 
some kind. The result assuring a veil of these refined 
steel-rings draping the vulnerable spots of the wearer's neck, 
throat, and collar.

helm UNIQUE_PGADRIL ByIarwain winged barbute steel METAL~
an elegant, winged barbute helm~
Made of radiating steel, an elegant helm with wings sits here.~
   Forged of steel and crafted with masterful precision and care, 
this helm invokes an image of a past age. The crown of the 
helmet is forged of flowing, seamless silvered steel that is 
expressionless save for a thin border of elegantly embossed trim. 
Lined with a soft linen pad for comfort, the helm is designed 
with both the soldier's comfort and protection in mind. At the 
neck the helm's steel flares subtly and elegantly outward. The 
helm's face is a T-Shaped opening, formed by the near joining of 
its broad, rigid cheek pieces. They cover the wearer's features 
almost entirely and stand out from the face, allowing even the 
open nose and eyes adequate protection while ensuring maximum 
visibility. The steel cheek guards are the wings of this helm, 
forged and etched to mimic the elegant spread of a bird of prey. 
The steel lightened, almost invoking the purity of white, and 
curved so that they arc sharply up along the sides of the head to 
peaks above it.

   This elegant weapon has been created through a combination of 
the best of steels mixed with silver during the molten stage. 
The blade is curved gracefully in the leaf blade shape and etched 
with vinery to image the winds. The steel cross-guard is forged 
to look like a flying seagull, the head and beak lie over the 
spine of the blade, the wings form the crosspiece, the body forms 
the hilt, and the tail feathers form the pommel. The body is 
indented in places to give better grip and carved into the steel 
hilt.

a charred bitterroot pendant~
A charred, pink glass bitterroot pendant on a rough cord is here.~
   It is a delicate pendant, lovingly made from clear, 
rose-tinted glass that wavers and twists within the crystal with 
streaks of silver and white. Shaped into a realistic bitterroot 
blossom in full bloom, it's petals are lengthy and slender around 
a gossamery-inspired set of stemen. It likely once hung from a 
similarly exquisite cord, yet has been slipped onto a rough piece 
of twine which is sturdy, if coarse. Most notably, however, this 
delicate flower has been charred and scratched, a taint upon it's 
beauty. Black lines tend to dominate it's extremities, and one 
of the petals bears a deep gash in a angled line down it's 
length. Regardless of this, the item remains structurally sound, 
a testament to it's craft in the making.

A fine cuirass of dragon-emblazoned leather rests here.~
   Obviously a work of great craftsmanship, fine leather has been 
used in a meld of different techniques to form this light yet 
effective body armor. Dyed a deep, ashen grey, the leather has 
been hardened in places of least movement, and left more 
malleable in areas where flexibility is required. Across the 
front, from breast to breast and extending down to the navel, the 
silhouette of a dragon, wings spread to the world, has been 
depicted, in an even darker shade of grey, bordering on black.

   Bastardizing what must have originally been a pair of soft 
workman's gloves, the gauntlets have been formed by affixing 
thick, protective leather scales over the lengths of the fingers. 
Hard plates and ridges of leather meld seamlessly with the soft 
pliability of the gloves to provide a meld of protection and 
flexibility. The plates are jointed over the wrist, where they 
continue to extend towards the forearms. Obviously the works of 
a master craftsman, these gauntlets offer the least amount of 
resistance to work of a dexterous nature.

providing a freedom of movement to the joints while still

of the armor have been patterned, each at a time, to depict 
nothing less than the scales of some great mythical beast.

the forging process. A small fuller runs down the middle of the 
blade, reducing the overall weight considerably. A liquefied 
sheen glistens off the edge of the knife - the scent released 
bitterly bold.

   With a silky tuft of dark hair atop his head, this tiny little 
baby boy is nigh always wriggling or moving. From his little 
feet kicking and shuffling to his wee hands that grasp and reach 
for anything that comes in to sight. His dark grey eyes peer out 
awestruck at the world around him and his mouth is always parted, 
save for when he has something to chew upon. He is in good 
health, albeit a little small.

plenty of room for up to a half-dozen or so occupants. Set into 
the far side of the hall, it has been raised several yards in to

WOOD bellows frame~
a set of large bellows fixed in a frame~
A set of large bellows fixed in a frame sits here.~
   These bellows are likely too large to be effectively worked 
manually by hand, and therefore have been mounted in a simple 
wooden frame. The fore of the folded bellows, with the nozzle 
protruding from the frame forwards, directs the contained 
atmosphere in a controlled direction. The front of the bellows 
is fixed in this position, while the back of the tubular chamber 
is attached to the collapsible back of the frame. When pressure 
is placed on the rear of the frame, the wooden slats slide over 
one another and the bellows condenses forwards, pushing air 
through the nozzle. As the frame is drawn back, the valves of 
the bellows force open to pull in atmosphere in anticipation of 
the next forward thrust of the frame.

hold them together on top and bottom, tying together at the back 
of the neck.

   This magnificent weapon is made of masterfully worked mithril. 
It is incredibly light for such a massive weapon and is covered 
with ancient script etchings along the blade. Extreme care has 
been taken to balance the weight between the blade and hilt. 
This balancing appears to speed up the momentum of the blade as 
it moves through its paces and makes it much easier to slow its 
progress. The hilt is constructed of a crystalline stone that 
exhibits a nearly fluid consistency when pressured.

tanned to a softness beneath the gentle touch, embroidered and 
dyed a proud, royal blue. The front of the book depicts stylized 
pillars rising on either side of the cover, small vines crawling 
up them, with the White Tree of Gondor growing proud, lush, and 
full in between them. Above the Tree, spread in a semicircle 
over it, are the Seven Stars. The Stars, The Tree, and the 
Pillars are all done in white to cast them in sharp, vibrant 
relief against the royal blue of the cover. The book itself 
seems to be composed of hundreds of high quality, vellum pages.

   This worn out robe covers the body, but provides little more 
in the way of protection from the elements. The threads are 
nearly worn through at the knees, shoulders and elbows and is 
unevenly frayed at the cuffs and hemline. The color is horribly 
faded from exposure and whatever the original color was, it is 
now unrecognizable beneath the dirt and sap. The robe is held 
closed with a slightly less worn piece of rope that is also 
frayed at the ends.

   Petrified through years of existence, this hunk of wood is 
straight enough to be used as a walking stick, but just barely. 
It kinks and bends at numerous places along its length, yet still 
retains the shape of a staff. The age of the wood can not be 
determined due to an oddly stained coloration of the entire 
staff. Despite the age and deformities, it does appear sound and 
could possibly be used as a long club if necessary.

   Standing taller than the average Gondorian is a statue of a 
rearing stallion. With a flowing mane, the sculptor has created 
the emotion and strength of an angered horse retaliating against 
some unseen foe. From head to flank, the marble has been 
smoothed to perfection and the smallest details have been seen 
to, down to the smallest nail in the horses hooves. The marble 
gives this majestic beast a salt and pepper coloring that shifts 
as light touches it.

   This small statue is nicely crafted of a lightly colored 
stone. Holding a small basin over her left shoulder, is a woman 
dressed in an overly long robe. The robe drags behind her, 
providing stability to the statuette. Attention to detail has 
been stressed with not only the folds of the dress standing out 
to be viewed, but also small ripples of water clearly represented 
inside the basin. Whether through the wear of time or foresight 
of the artist, even small wrinkles can be seen in the woman's 
dress with close inspection.

   Composed of solid granite is a statue of a warg and a 
Gondorian soldier. The warg gnashes its teeth menacingly over 
the soldier even as a longsword is being pushed into the belly. 
The rough granite does a fine job of maintaining the flowing feel 
of the motion portrayed in the scene. Very thin lines are 
lightly chisled into the hair of the soldier and fur of the warg. 
Even the claws have been outlined, giving credit to the artist's 
talented work.

   This small ceramic cup could almost be overlooked, were it not 
for the incredible detail used to paint it. Elves, dwarves and 
men are remembered as they break bread around a table in some 
outdoor courtyard. In the background, gulls can be seen hovering 
above a busy port. Ships reside in the distance, with sailors 
loading cargo for some historical voyage. The occupants 
surrounding the table are dressed finely in robes and tunics, 
suggesting a peaceful moment in time. The cup itself is of a 
simple ceramic make and the paint used to visualize the scene is 
unremarkable.

for the kill. With arrow knocked and bowstring taught, the 
hooded marksman leans their head slightly behind the arrow. The

feet and a blending of the string to the hunters cheek, but the 
overall quality is very high.

Feathers are carefully and individually carved from the stone 
with clear attention to detail. The rabbit appears to have been 
taken by surprise and the artist has captured this in the small

   Cast from gold and lined with sapphires and diamonds, this

little functionality due to the small carrying space, but the 
artistry employed in its design is exquisite. A mountain and

diamonds and sapphires placed above in an accurate representation 
of the night sky over Minas Tirith. The bowl itself is thicker 
than most and takes on an added bit of weight because of this.

a sculpture of the siege of Osgiliath~
A sculpture of the siege of Osgiliath is here.~
   Worn and weary, the defenders of Osgiliath fought for life and 
death. The scene has been recreated on this piece with three 
Gondorian soldiers fending off orcish ladder teams by hand and 
with bows. With a two handed grip, one soldier appears in the 
process of pushing the enemy ladder away from the wall while 
another stands defensively behind him with sword and shield. To 
the side is the third soldier taking aim with a shortbow, should 
anything come over the walls edge. The stone of the parapet is 
carved with intentionally placed minor flaws to the stonework. 
Each of the soldiers weapons are inlaid with silver and the 
ladder itself is cast from pure gold.

The corpse of a short, wizened, lump-footed gaffer lies here, slouched over.~
The diminuitive body has a broad face, paling quickly from the
onset of death and his advanced age. A bulbous nose set between
amber eyes hold no life to them now, just a calm emptiness. A
scraggly scruff of snow-white hair that might almost constitute
a beard clings to his face, barely disguising sagging cheeks.
Wispy white hair hangs in soft curls down to his shoulders
concealing ears which have begun to take on a deathly pallor.
His slightly paunchy belly rises no more to draw breath, his
spindly legs dangling lifelessly ending at a set of bare feet,
the tops of which are covered in a fine white hair. His right
foot is badly mishappen and even in death shows signs of still
being swollen.

   It is evident at first glance that this poor man was victim to 
a brutal beating prior to his demise. A plethora of abrasions 
and slices adorn his skin, blood from his broken-looking nose 
dried upon his face and chest. Upon closer inspection, one might 
come to understand that he likely drown in his own blood, due to 
someone removing his tongue completely. A black strip of cloth 
has been tied neatly over his eyes.

a pecked to death crow's corpse~
A pecked to death crow's corpse rests here.~
Having tumbled from some great height, many of the bones about the wings
just broken and haphazardly from the bloody wing tissue, feathers
scattered and spread about its body, broken and shredded. The left eye
of the crow hangs out of its socked, pecked and with portions of the
eye missing altogether. The crow's right foot having been torn out of
place and lying a foot away, the bloody stump oozing blood which
quickly begins to congeal. Numerous wounds that appear to be inflicted
by one or multiple birds score the rest of its body.

a finely crafted metalworking hammer~
A glinting steel blacksmith's hammer lays here, engraved along its broad head.~
   Solid steel makes up this metalworking implement. The head is 
large and finely forged, with a broad and flat surface, rather 
than the slight bowl of a normal hammer. The head is slightly 
counterbalanced across the steel haft it is seated on, the 
opposing side a somewhat smaller measure of the glinting metal. 
Carefully assembled, the hammer is well balanced and easily 
hefted. Along the haft an inscription has been set, etched 
deeply into the steel in carefully placed script.

An open grave lay here, containing a rotten, commonly dressed
corpse. The smell emitted from the grave is not severe, causing
great discomfort to those with strong stomachs, and those who
are unfamiliar with the scent of decomposing dead will most
likely be emptying their stomachs onto the ground. The body within
is barely recognizable for any trace of gender or race. If the body
bore any fatal wounds, it is impossible to say, as most of the
flesh has already rotted as maggots and crows continue to feast
upon the body.

A bit of parchment bearing a crest lies here on the ground.~
   This torn bit of parchment has seen better days, one side of 
it jagged in appearance as if it once belongs in a tome or book 
but has since been torn out. The upper edges of it bears ink 
stains of various colors, colors that make up the profoundly 
detailed image this parchment holds. In the center of this paper 
there is the vividly detailed image of a large dark grey and 
black wolf in a resting position, between the fore paws of the 
wolf is a small lynx of cream, pale grey and black color hues 
marking its fur. Both creatures have their heads turned as if 
staring at the viewer. In the background is a field what appears 
to be nothing but a vast field of snow, occasionally marked with 
small hills and trees. Bordering the two animals is a crawling 
vine in a high arc, the color a mix of dark and light greens, 
several roses in various stages of bloom stuck within the twisted 
vines.

leaves, set with slivers of emerald and accented with veins of 
gold adorn the band. Almost lifelike in their detail, the vines 
twist up at the top of the ring, grasping a fat, brilliant blue 
diamond. Catching and reflecting light with its many facets, the 
stone gleams resplendently in its setting.

   This cloak is fashioned of lustrous fine linen dyed a deep and 
vivid forest green. The garment is loose fitting and billows 
easily about the wearer's form when donned but can be closed 
securely with a single golden fox-shaped clasp in the front. The 
edges bear a simple fur trim of soft grey rabbit fur, allowing 
for warmth to be trapped within the fabric of the cloak when 
closed about the form. Upon the back of this cloak, set just 
above where a person's shoulder-blades might be, is an intricate 
frost-white embroidered fox. The fox is a right-facing profile 
image, masterful detail given to its fur and features.

an enruned, lebethron hilted greatsword~
An enruned, lebethron hilted greatsword lies here.~
   This large weapon has seen the turn of many centuries. Its 
lebethron hilt, likely one of the many replacements during the 
life of the weapon, does not show as much age as the blade 
itself. Though the blackened steel shows not a knick or sign of 
wear, the Sindarin script that runs up its fuller hails from a 
previous age . The blade is thickest - moreso than is usual for 
this type of weapon - just above the up angled crosspiece and 
tapers slowly to a point. The first third is blunted and thick, 
for gripping should it be required. The counterweight at the 
weapon's bottom is a great iron snarling wolf's head.

a blackend-steel, cloth-wrapped half-helm~
A blackend-steel, cloth-wrapped half-helm lies here.~
   Made from high quality steel, this half-helm has been 
blackened and covered in black cloth to better conceal its user. 
Its build is sturdy and it offers excellent protection. This 
custom piece has been designed with look curved spikes along its 
top for cloth to be held upon. It is a new spin on an old 
conceit.

elegant embroidered dark brown courbouilli vambrace MASTER_QUALITY BY_BONES PC_ASIRNAITH LEATHER~
an elegantly-embroidered, dark-brown courbouilli vambrace~
An elegantly formed leather bracer has been left here, the rigid form keeping its shape in the dust.~
   Tailored masterfully and artistically for a specific 
individual, this long vambrace is composed of supple, 
high-quality leather. It has been treated with a waxing process 
and boiled to a significant level of rigidity. Dyed a rich 
dark-brown, it begins approximately an inch below the wrist on 
the hand, the bottom area quite straight, and reaches up in an 
oval formation to a point at the wearer's elbow. The edges of 
the piece are lined by layers of weaving scarlet thread that 
twists back and forth in rippling motion just next to the outside 
edge. The entire face of the vambrace is covered with a flowing, 
exquisitely-detailed design of sweeping whorls, waves, and 
interweaving ivy-like scarlet embroidery. It is clear that this 
shows the piece as more a work of art through a master's hand, 
than a mere piece of combat gear.

Dress two-toned purple wool linen UNIQUE_TAYMEEKA XElanor TEXTILE~
a two-toned purple dress of wool and linen~
A two-toned purple dress of wool and linen lies here in a pile of fabric.~
   This dress is sewn by a skillful hand and bears neat stitches 
along its seams. Consisting of two layers of different fabrics, 
this dress offers optimal warmth and comfort when worn. The top 
layer is dyed a deep rich purple and is plain wool that hugs the 
figure nicely and drapes down in a full, gored skirt that gives 
it ample room for movement. The bottom layer of fabric is soft, 
plain linen dyed pale lavender and contrasts vividly against the 
dark purple wool. The sleeves of the dress are that of the linen 
layer and drape down generously in a loose-fitting style, 
embroidered with simple silver diamond stitching that matches the 
diamond pattern along the hem of the skirt of this dress. One of 
the diamonds on the bottom hem of the skirt looks a bit off; one 
side bent a fraction but only noticeable upon close inspection.

longsword Simple badly notched iron BYBONES PC_EMBRAN METAL~
a simple, badly-notched iron longsword~
A heavily notched longsword lays here, the iron of the blade battered and damaged by time and use.~
   Once a functional, if plain-looking weapon, this longsword has 
been severely damaged by the rigours of battle. With an 
unadorned, slightly curved crossguard and a small squared pommel, 
the entire weapon is about three spans long. All a uniform iron 
grey, it tapers to a stabbing point. The blade, however, shows a 
great deal of use, with numerous dents and nicks along its 
length. The weapon's functionality and durability is severely 
impaired by a deep notch, not far up from the hilt. Despite its 
wear, the weapon has been kept in good shape, the edge 
functionally sharp.

Belegant infant pitch-black wavy haired baby boy UNIQUE_SHARLINE xElanor OTHER~
#5a pitch-black wavy haired baby boy#0~
#5A pitch-black wavy haired baby boy#0 lies here.~
   This baby boy has a mane of wavy pitch-black hair. His 
bright, big, round brown eyes peer out at the world, glimmering 
with a quiet sparkle that conveys a feeling of innocent 
curiosity. Smooth skin, light and creamy is drawn over the soft 
plumpness all healthy young babies seem to be gifted with. 
Chubby cheeks add a certain cuteness to this baby's face which, 
when graced with a smile reveals small dimples only adding to the 
affect. Often found within a thoughtful silence this baby can 
still easily be tempted into a happy chuckle or upset cry.

mask steel ornate forged despair BY_BONES UNIQUE_LALLA METAL~
an ornately forged steel mask~
A well-polished mask of steel lays here, its designs reflecting light through the dust.~
   Crafted with obvious care, this mask of fine steel has been 
made to fit a particular face. The inner contours of the object 
have been ground down and polished smooth, preventing any 
possible friction between the wearer and the mask. Its outer 
surface has been created in a particular image. Its features 
have been forged into a solemn rictus, with the only potential 
ostentation the eyes. Just below the slots where the wearer 
looks through, small literal teardrops of iron have been dripped 
carefully across the cheeks. Though without expression, the 
additional metal gives credence to the appearance of weeping.

crude iron mask METAL~
a crude iron mask~
A crude iron mask has been abandoned here.~
   This crude mask is made of thin, hammered iron. Speckled with 
small patches of rust and darkened areas, due to the low quality 
of the crafter and of the metal, this can, nevertheless serve 
fittingly to hide the face of the bearer. A pair of simple holes 
have been made to fit the eyes and a larger one below allows one 
to speak and breathe. A pair of crude leather laces permit this 
to be strapped to the face, although this would be only for 
masking the identity of the bearer, not a protection in combat.

an ornately etched staff~
A fine, hefty staff of fine steel lays here collecting dust.~
     Of considerable heft, this length of steel has been forged into a walking staff. With a clawed base for traction while climbing, the item bears a considerably well-made appearance. Polished to a mirror shine, its surface holds scrolling artwork. Symbols and images ranging from the heraldry of the Greathouse Astirian, to a grand albeit 'curved' scene of a woodland are etched into it. With the attention paid to its construction, it can only have been crafted by a skilled artisan.

#5A baby boy with hair of strawberry#0 is here.~
   This small infant has minimal amounts of red hair growing atop 
his head. His features are chubby, rounded and baby-like, with 
much more room to grow. He's compact and scarcely takes up any 
room. His eyes easily glow like the vibrance of waters, curious 
and large.
