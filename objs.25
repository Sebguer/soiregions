a steel NO_LOAD gladius with a red leather handle byClub METAL~
a steel gladius with a red leather handle~
A steel gladius with a red leather handle has been left on the ground.~
   Made by a masterful hand, the steel on this gladius is 
tempered and sharp enough to pierce through flesh like butter. 
The hilt looks like a half-circle and the handle is wrapped in 
high-quality red leather that provides an excellent grip for its 
user. The pommel at the end balances the rest of this lethal 
weapon. Overall it looks simple, lacking any intricate details, 
but a trained eye can tell that this is not a tool to be reckoned 
with.

BOGGLE NO-LOAD ADMIN-UNIQUE BY_Vaire Trophy-for-frigga silver gold trophy METAL~
a small boggle trophy, framed in gold and silver~
A small boggle trophy, framed in gold and silver rests here.~
It is a game of boggle, brilliantly with four panes of strudy, but
clear glass to form the cover of the base, the intersecting pieces
of glass held firmly together with a silver wire filigree. The
dice within this set are etched with lettering upon carved ivory
pieces, the lettering painted black with masterful precision. The
base of the set itself is forged from gold, little dividers which
allow the dice to rest neatly within, and the square sides of the
base are etched with magnificent figures, such as Readmanu, a
Lhurgoyf, and others. Beneath the base of the tropy, you can see
a little piece of parchment stick out, titled #6help rules#0.

Thick oaken wooden planks are fitted tightly together so as to 
leave no openings for any liquid to escape the container. At 
three locations, the barrel is circumvented by thick iron bands. 
A plain removable lid locks the barrel from the top, while a 
narrow spout allows smaller containers to be filled.
