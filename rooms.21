A Leather-Scented Storeroom~
   Built from simple planks of wood fitted lengthways and painted 
tan, this storeroom is filled with racks and shelves that match 
the well-sanded beechwood floor. With a hand-sized window that 
opens up from a narrow pane of glass, there is plenty of light 
within the room, and a surprising amount of storing space. A 
solid door of iron-banded beechwood leads into the workshop.

A Spartan Sitting Room~
   Made from planks of wood painted tan and fitted lengthways 
together, this sitting room's floor is beechwood sanded to a 
silken smoothness, covered with a practical deep brown rug from 
runs from wall to wall. It is located on the top floor, obvious 
by the neat trapdoor in the far side of the room, and the 
furniture is solid and well-made. On one side of the room is a 
window, easily closed with well-made shutters, and two doors lead 
into other rooms while an open archway reveals the kitchen 
beyond.

A Simple But Comfortable Bedroom~
   Built from wooden planks fitted lengthways and floored with 
smooth-sanded beechwood, this comfortably large bedroom has been 
painted tan and floored with a big plush rug of deep brown wool. 
Its furniture is a cut above the rest of the building, the window 
large enough to give a view of the street outside and well- 
shuttered to keep the weather out. A door that can be locked 
leads into the sitting room, and there is a small tiled area 
which contains a fireplace for those chilly nights.

A Long, Relatively Narrow Room~
   Long but relatively narrow, this room is built from planks of 
lengthways-fitted wood painted tan and a smooth-sanded beechwood 
floor, able to fit a few beds, a couple of chests and a wardrobe 
before becoming crowded. The furniture is well-made, but a 
little battered, and the rug on the floor is a deep brown. The 
window is covered by shutters on the side furthest from the door, 
allowing in plenty of light.

A Beech-Floored Kitchen~
   Built from planks of wood fitted lengthways and floored in 
well-sanded beechwood, this kitchen is small but roomy enough for 
a few people to move around in. An open archway leads into the 
sitting room beyond, but within the kitchen, a hand-sized window 
that opens up from a small pane of glass allows plenty of light 
within. The furniture is well-made and solid, and there is 
enough room at the back end for a fireplace and stove.

A Tidy Cobbler's Shop~
   The raw, earthy smell of leather fills the air of this spare 
and quiet shop, mingling with the faint odor of lamp oil from the 
lanterns along the walls, that are left to burn throughout the 
day. Long pine shelves line the walls, aged to a pale, golden 
color, all manner of shoes and boots arranged upon them, neatly 
displayed in pairs. Opposite the door is a short, sanded 
counter, a few tins of shoe-polish stacked carefully upon it. A 
low hard bench has been placed in the center of the room, the 
soft wood of the unstained floorboards scratched and pitted 
around it.

Colors of the White City~
   The room is filled with the lingering scent of chemicals that 
seem to be coming from the items that were set out upon the 
shelves that line the walls. The shelves were lined with a 
slight bit of colored cloth, helping remove the dullness of the 
small room. The room was seperated by an oak counter that was 
also covered with a richly dyed cloth. Behind the counter there 
are a few strips of red dyed cloth that would hang against the 
walls of the back of the back of the shop, just barely touching 
the ground.

A Smelly, Functionally-Built Butcher Shop~
   There is no nonsense about this decently sized butcher shop. 
Leaving little room for the customer to roam, the room has been 
unevenly split into two sections by a pinewood counter that 
unceremoniously displays heaps of varying forms of bloody meat. 
On both sides of the counter, the wooden floor has been entirely 
covered in sawdust, it cancelling out some of the foul smells. 
In the much larger, cordoned off section of the butchery all 
variants of carcasses, from rat to boar, hang from sharp, 
sporadically positioned hooks. A large, square chopping block 
bluntly sits in the center of the work area, standing higher than 
most men's hips and roughly half the size of a table. Many 
variants of meat are scattered all about its chipped and chopped 
surface and knives, cleavers, saws, hatchets and other vicious 
tools are often found either resting upon it or stabbed into it. 
Noticably, covering much of the rear wall near the door leading 
into the shops innards, a grand, tatty and blood-splotched black 
flag depicting a white tree is nailed into place.

A Square, Moderately-Sized Room~
   The smell of the butchery still lingers in this nicely sized 
area. Despite the odour's presence, the room has been set up as 
a living area, with many distractions that not only trick the 
mind into forgetting the stench but sometimes kill it in its 
entirely. A well-sized table takes center piece, with six chairs 
all neatly tucked underneath when not in use. Along one side of 
the wall a fuctional kitchen has been setup, with cupboards, 
shelves and more holding food ready to be cooked. Opposite the 
kitchen facilities and neatly nestled into the wall is a small 
fireplace with a roomy couch facing it. There are two filthy 
windows in the kitchen area. The sections of this rooms walls 
that are left untouched by necessities have been heavily 
decorated. Black flags of varying sizes depicting white trees 
are found here and there. As well as this, there are several 
paintings nailed into the walls. There are two simple doors, one 
leading into the butchery and the other leading into a locked 
area; a set of rickety stairs and a trapdoor leads upwards.

A Broad, Cozy Room~
   This simple, well-built room has been constructed for 
versatility. Not overly large or awkwardly small, it could serve 
most functions one were to designate it. With one window set in 
its northern wall, it can still be cast into shadow during the 
day depending on the sun's position, and there is a musky air to 
the place. A simple oaken trapdoor at the top of the stairs 
leads back into the living area.

An unused masonry shop~
   This room is free of clutter with a few small garden fountains 
and sculptures set up around the room. At the back of the store 
is a long oak counter that runs the length of the wall. 
Customers come and go looking over the wares or speaking with the 
shop keeper about buildings. The room remains illuminated by 
carefully spaced lamps hung from the ceiling.

Overall, the room is maintained with a sense of military

Sounds of the City~
   The walls and floors of this shop have been closely fitted 
together, the seams of the rich, dark wood smooth and polished. 
Shelves run along the walls, secured tightly to them with metal 
fastenings. Along the back wall, a counter runs the length of 
the store, displaying more of the shop's wares behind a locked 
glass case. Often, the rich sound of instruments being played 
echoes through the room, making it rarely silent even when it is 
nearly empty of customers.

In an Entry Chamber~
   The smooth stone of this building looks to be ancient, but 
well-cared-for, evidenced by the hairline cracks that run here 
and there despite the apparent sturdiness of the walls. The 
entry chamber is large in size, and only two doors have been set 
into the walls. Both doorframes have been carved with images of 
the White Tree, the branches extending along the lines of the 
wood. Along the smooth stone floor, only a few pieces of 
furniture even attempt to fill some of the space.

floor of this large room, however, are made of stunning white 
stone. The ceiling rises high above, a chandelier hanging from 
it to provide the room with light. Regardless of the time of

A Quiet, Richly-Decorated Chamber~
   Smooth, perfectly cut smoky grey blocks of stone comprise the 
walls of this chamber, covered in places by elaborate tapestries 
depicting battle scenes primarily in vivid shades of crimson and 
black. Nearly every color of the room is of a sombre hue--but 
for the shades of scarlet occasionally visible in the wall 
hangings and furnishings. Three doors lead out from here; one 
leads into a garden visible through glass doors, and two others 
open east and north. Regardless of the time of year, a chill 
lingers on the air.

An Elegant Dormitory~
   Unlike most rooms that would be called a dormitory, this one 
is neither small nor cramped; it is rather large, and the spaces 
between the well-crafted beds are large. Each of the beds has 
been neatly arranged in a straight line, headboard against the 
northernmost wall. The colors of the furnishings in the room 
tend towards the darker hues, each item with such colors 
elegantly-crafted and giving the room more of a look of a large 
bedroom than a dormitory. A single door leads out, back into a 
private reception area.

In a Quiet, Stone-Walled Garden~
   Tall, sturdy walls of stone surround this expansive garden, 
seamlessly fitting block after block together. No breaks or 
interruptions are visible, but for the opening where glass doors 
have been set into the eastern stone wall. Along the walls are 
prickly shrubs planted at regular intervals and allowing a small 
amount of space between them. Though the garden is well-kept and 
carefully-trimmed, few colors manage to emerge; the only 
flowering plants are rosebushes with deep crimson petals and 
long, sharp thorns.

   Darkness and cold permeate the area, lingering at all hours of 
the day regardless of the time of year. The walls are of a cool, 
solid stone, carved out to allow steps to wind around in a 
spiraling fashion. They seem to be endless as they wind further 
and further down, and when one is halfway down, both the bottom 
and top are lost in shadows. Only the occasional torch provides 
enough light to see by, making the trip rather precarious.

A Preternaturally Shadowed Altar Room~
   The only visible entrance to this darkened, spherical list 
chamber is the long, ornate spiral staircase that leads down from 
the western wall. The walls of this circular chamber are set of 
a complete, solid stone that, despite their seemingly common 
enough origin, glint strangely whenever the light hits the stone 
at odd intervals. An almost superflous number of wall-sconces, 
some ten spaced evenly along the stone wall, usually illuminate 
this area, the torches placed at such a height, however, as to 
allow them to be easily snuffed. Dominating the center of the 
room, however, is a large, black-steel altar that seems to have 
been inscribed with lines of gold filigree, tracing it in its 
entirety. Sitting atop it is a strangely-high, black-crimson 
candle.

Diamond in the Rough~
   A series of candles set in sconces at equal distances around 
the room provides the light for this modestly-sized shop. With 
the flickering of the flames, reflections are cast from the 
tapestries studded with raw gemstones and a few that seem to be 
polished. The glimmering is nigh-constant, from the tapestries 
to the cloth over the countertop. In cases throughout the room, 
stones have been set up on display. Two doors have been set into 
the walls, one leading north out onto the street, and the other 
to the south remaining locked at all times.

   Made from large blocks of white stone, typical of the 
structures in Minas Tirith, this large room is spacious and 
comfortable. A double-door opens from the south in to the 
establishment, and those entering are greeted with comfort. Hung 
on the walls are old tapestries, representing images of the White 
City and Gondor; many of them have burn marks or holes cut in to 
them, worn and faded. To the north, though an opening between 
rounded columns one would see a small kitchen - off to the side 
is a winding staircase.

surrounded by cupboards and shelves along the otherwise bare 
walls. Cobwebs hang and glint around the edge of the ceiling, 
illuminated by the torches and candles that are positioned in

A Warm, Second-Story Lounge~
   Numerous iron scones surround this room, all bearing lanterns 
of brass; a stone fireplace is set in the southern wall. Comfy 
furniture is spread around the fireplace, a fur rug spread out in 
the centre to give the lounge a feeling of comfort. The walls 
here bear four artistic, tasteful portraits - two male, two 
female. Each portrait has been defaced with a blade or some form 
of sharp object, yet the bodies of each individual is left in 
tact and unspoiled. Plain wooden doors lead to surrounding 
rooms, and to the southern end of the lounge a pair of white 
stone columns rise, marking the beginning of the winding 
staircase downwards.

   Of considerable size, this room would appear to have once been 
comfortable and luxurious. A large window is set in the eastern 
wall, looking down over the lower tiers of the White City, 
offering a view all the way to the black mountains of Ephel 
Duath. The room is bare aside from a single, scratched desk 
which sits before the wide window, surrounded by a multitude of 
wax candles and iron torches. The barren room appears to be 
constantly in light, the corners devoid of cobwebs as they are of 
shadows.

   Ledges and small alcoves in the white stone walls of this room 
are constantly filled with clutters of burning candles, causing 
built up melted wax to drip down toward the floor, cooled in the 
shape of a still waterfall. Lanterns hang all around, casting 
all shadow from the room in twilight hours, though aside from 
that the walls are barren. In the centre of the room, away from 
all the walls, is a single bed, the posts scratched and numerous 
sigils roughly carved into it.

   Appearing to be largely untouched, this room is covered in a 
thin film of dust. Spread over the floor is a dirt-clotted rug 
of fur, seeming for the most part undisturbed. A desk is set on 
the eastern wall, covered in old pieces of parchment and 
leather-bound tomes; an ink well still bares a quill, long dried. 
Hung over a wooden rack near the desk is a set of expensive 
robes, smelling strongly of mothballs and eaten away with time.

A Cold Dormitory and Sitting Area~
   The air in this room, regardless of hour and season, remains 
utterly chilled and slightly damp, the feeling almost oppressive 
to those who pass into it. A staircase spirals upwards from 
here, though the top of it is shrouded in shadows. A single door 
otherwise leads to the north, shelves and storage crates visible 
from here.

A Large Storage Room~
   Masterfully crafted shelves of rich mahogany line the walls, 
giving plenty of space to store supplies and various items. 
These walls, however, seem as though they have been carved from 
stone, providing a contrast to these shelves and to the wood- 
paneled floor. The only visible exit lies to the south, leading 
into a dormitory and sitting area.

An Ovicular Room Lined with Torches~
   Descent into this room seems to be something of a one-way, or 
deadend, venture, as there is no visible exit, save that of the 
entryway of the narrow staircase and above trapdoor. The room 
itself is shaped in a perfect circle, some ten torches spaced 
evenly around the massive altar that dominates the center of the 
room, the light from each torch reflected, refraged from the gold 
glyphs atop the dark place of worship. Regardless of the larger 
number of torches, there is still a rather shadowed feel to the 
room, as if the light was almost unwelcome; an intruder. Were 
one not used to such a place, they'd quick feel a growing sense 
of unease, discomfort.

A Tasteful Dining Room~
   The walls of this room are tastefully paneled with rich 
mahagony. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling on a brass chain, 
candles flickering against etched glass. A heavy wooden door is 
set into the northern wall, the outer edges carved with 
intertwining vines and leaves. White stone tiles the floor in an 
intriguing pattern of hexagons and rectangles. A large fireplace 
formed of masterfully-dressed small white stones is set in the 
center of the eastern wall, topped with a heavy mantle of 
mahagony. North of the fireplace, an opening leads into the 
kitchen.

An Orderly, White-Tiled Kitchen~
   This spacious kitchen is walled with white tiles, one line of 
rich blue running all around, four feet off the floor. The 
immaculate floor is of well-cut, light grey, hexagonal stone, 
mortared with white. In the northeast corner, a staircase of the 
same grey stone, carpeted with a runner that matches the line of 
blue tile around the room, leads upward, a mahogany banister 
providing safely. Ample storage and work space has been provided 
in a tasteful fashion. A large fireplace of masterfully-dressed 
small white stones is set in the western wall. An opening leads 
into the dining room to the west, while a stained oak door is set 
into the northern wall. A window to the east looks out onto a 
narrow strip of grass between two buildings.

into most parts of the room, giving it at least a warm orange hue 
when the light begins to fade outside. Through a window in the 
southern wall one can see a reasonably quiet little street lined 
with tiered housing and citizens going about their daily 
business. Being the attic of a small house, the roof tapers 
upward here into a shadowy cone where cobwebs cling to the wood 
and plaster.

torchlight that illuminates the rest of the bedroom in a firey 
orange glow. The room is roughly square in shape and rough 
wooden boards make up the walls, with little to no decoration of 
their own except a pallid whitewash of paint. There is a small 
fireplace in one corner of the room and other pieces of furniture 
are set back against the walls. A small window peers out onto

brown though a few tapestries and paintings have been hung to 
provide meagre decoration. A number of chairs, tables and 
armchairs have been set around the room and a small rock 
fireplace is set in the southern wall near the window which looks 
out onto the street below. Another small door is set in the 
northern wall, an aromatic smell coming from its confines at

   The hallway bends from north to east here through this 
somewhat archaic house. The beams of the roof are no longer the 
straight-edged pieces they once were and suffer from some kind of 
rot. What it lakes in the ceiling, however, it makes up for with 
recently polished mahogany planks which make the walls of the 
hallway and a soft grey carpet. Torches line the wall, 
flickering quietly in their iron sconces.

some effort is made every once in a while to sweep it to a side. 
Oil lanterns hanging from the ceiling keep the room fairly 
well-lit at all hours of the day and night.

muffles any sound filtering up or down through the floorboards 
underfoot. This utilitarian room is completely devoid of

not ready to start immediately.

with enough eager citizens gathered around reading them out for 
even the illiterate to understand what is on offer.

Once containing the fresh fruits of a grocer's stall, now this 
place is a decaying stone cell. Rough bricks are streaked with 
the slime and fungi brought on by flooding now receded. Dead 
rats lay in corners while beetles and other tiny creatures 
skitter away from any light source. This square storeroom is the

A Cramped Backroom~
   Slightly larger than the shopfront to the east, this box of a 
room has low ceilings. Centered on the eastern wall is a large 
painting of a sailing ship on the rough seas. While somewhat 
dull in color, it is majestic, though streaked with stains. On 
the right side of the painting is a heavy aged door of dark wood. 
The floor is lined with planks that loosely lay upon a stone 
floor, clearly visible in places where the poor workmanship 
failed entirely. Many of the boards along the ground have been 
broken or pulled out completely lending to the patchwork nature 
of the floor. A large trapdoor in the southern half of the room 
offers an iron hoop for purchase.

Block, Stock & Barrel~
   Little light is allowed through the dirty, tiny windows of 
this shopfront. The untreated pine lumber walls are marred with 
various waterstains and the grimy boarded floor is missing pieces 
here and there. The creaking of the floor is eerie against the 
mostly deserted street outside. Tarnished brass lanterns hung by 
rusted chains provide the dim lighting for all but the farthest 
corners. The felted ceiling has veins of cracks that span its 
entirety. Along the walls are many set of rickety shelves, 
containing a miscellany of various shapes and sizes. In the 
center of the eastern wall is a heavy door leading out to the 
street. Partly hidden in the far western corner, opposite the 
entrance, is a small door. While not as heavy as the first, its 
frame is lined with thick wood. Time has not been kind to any 
part of this shopfront, decaying and dirty as it is.

A Large, Dry Storeroom~
   In contrast to the remainder of this squalid place, this is a 
spacious and dry stone storeroom, cold and stretching back a full 
two lengths of the room outside. Lanterns rest along the middle 
of the roof beam and lend constant pools of light to the area.

Shady Arch Under the Southern Section of the Great Market~
   This shadowed section of the ruined Great Market is clearly 
used still, as crates and debris litter the area, along with a 
strong smell of meat and leather. rats scurry around in the 
darkened alcove where the occasional hooded figure pauses and 
hawks goods.

Inside A Magnificent Carriage~
   Smelling slightly of cedar wood that lines the floor, the 
interior of this carriage is beautiful in design. Against the 
far wall, a 'U' of long, comfortable seats have been crafted of 
green and gold velvet, long enough to act as three beds. A 
window for speaking to the driver also sits in this wall, small, 
and covered in green curtains. On both sides, small windows have 
been inset into the wood, allowing fresh air, or in the worst 
case, defense against any who may attack its riders or cargo. 
Against the back wall, an area has been set aside to stack and 
secure crates and chests, large shelves made of thick, hard oak. 
Again, in the back, an exit stands, providing a way to load 
goods, luggage, and people. While riding over any terrain, the 
carriage jostles and bumps a bit, much moreso on rough trails.

A Large Foyer Made of Rough, Dark Ashlars~
   Crafted carefully of rough, dark grey ashlars, this room looks to
almost be some part of a castle or keep. Its walls seem to almost
absorb the light that comes from the sconces around the room,
maintaining a shadowy feel even in the height of the day. High above
the floor, two arches crafted of the same rough stone lead inward to
the house proper. The floor has been created by rather smooth stones,
and in the very center of the floor, two large golden-flecked marble 
coins have been set into the stone.
   To the north, stone changes to a dark, highly polished wood as
it continues into the house proper. Far above, inset above the doorway
is a small stained-glass window that lets in a stream of light in the
day. Southwards, twin, ornate wooden doors stand, carved in a
depection of a bustling market.

A Greatroom of Master Craftsmanship~
   Built of stone, then designed with opulence and rich color, 
this room is indeed what is considered a great room. The floors 
have been finished with supple-mahogany, dark and smooth. The 
freshly-gilded walls rise several feet overhead to an airy 
rotunda whose windows allow warm sunlight to filter in during the 
day, moonglow by night. Furniture sits in the center of the 
room, designed to make use of the wall space surrounding it. 
Sound moves easily in this room, providing an easy place to offer 
entertainment and music.

A Curving Hallway Northward~
   Although wide enough to fit four men abreast down its entire 
length, this hallway has the effect of hiding both ends, due to 
its slightly curved structure. The floor has been carpeted in a 
soft golden color, plush yet resiliant to touch. The walls are 
molded at the bottom with smooth white planks, and lined in a 
similar color dental at the top. 
   Northward the hallway continues, while to the east, mahogany 
double doors offer entry into another part of the house.

An Ornate, Mahogany Floored Office~
   In a beautiful effort to mix comfort with opulence, this study 
functions first and foremost as a study and office. It has been 
floored in darkly stained, rich mahogany planks that run 
diagnally from southwest to northeast. Large shelves of the same 
wood encompass the walls, reaching up twice the height of a 
normal celing to the rafters above. Everything is polished and 
well-organized, although keeping it this way must be a daily 
task. A ladder is attached to the shelves, allowing a rolling 
way to reach even the top tiers of books. 
   To the west, six-paneled double doors offer entry into 
different spaces of the house.

A Cramped Spiral Stone Staircase~
   Twisting downward into darkness this stairway goes, its dark 
stones becoming damp the further they decend. It is a narrow 
passage between the walls, and any suffering from a fear of 
closed spaces would not do well here. When it rains, or snow 
melts, a faint dripping can be heard among the stones. It smells 
musty here, most likely due to a near constant tempature, and the 
humidity of the place.

A Secure, Stone-Walled Vault~
   Very evidently, this room's purpose is to secure valuables. 
The stone that makes up the walls, floors, and ceiling is thick 
and strong. Glittering baubles are everywhere; places for coins, 
weapons, and suits of armor. It is a large room, for a vault, 
but small in comparison to others. About twenty men could fit in 
here, however uncomfortably, if they packed in tight.

The End of A Curving Hallway~
   Capped in white dentals, and bottomed in white moldings, the 
dark burgandy paint of the hall is contrasted sharply. The 
carpet is a soft golden color, resiliant and plush to the touch. 
The hall curves slightly southwards, not allowing for the other 
end to be seen. Ornate sconces have been set along its entire 
length, offering bright light whenever called upon. 
   To the south, the hallway continues its trek. Westwards, an 
archway of riverrock opens up onto an immaculate dining room.

   Large and rectangle, this room could play host to a great 
number of people. It has been floored in dark mahogany, richly 
painted a deep red, and capped at the top and bottom of the walls 
in white dentals and moldings, respectfully. Ornate silver and 
golden lamps have been affixed to the walls about every ten 
hands, offering the ability to use lots of light, or very little. 
   Southwards, a wooden door carved with vines and leaves offers 
passage outside. It is flanked by long, thin windows on both 
sides. To the west, ornate-double-doors give workers a beautiful 
entrance at dinner times.

white stones so as to prevent the spread of any fire. A 
fireplace in matching color has been built into one wall and 
nearby, a stove is placed with a pipe that leads up to the 
ceiling to spread warm air throughout the whole home. Ornate, 
double doors to the east lead to a large dining room while a 
smaller and simpler door of pine to the west leads into the 
worker's quarters.

   While not huge, this cellar stretches out in a square. Its 
stone walls are rough, and damp, kept cool in even the dead heat 
of summer. It has been dug reasonably deep, many feet from the 
surface, allowing meats and wines to stay a good tempature. A 
dirt floor, hard packed though dirty, would need to be leveled 
now and again with a rake. 
   The only exit, in or out of this dank cellar is up, through a 
trap door at the top of a simple wooden staircase.

   Plush carpeting of a pale, gold colour covers the whole of the 
floor here affording soft padding with each step. The walls are 
painted in the same color but of a darker hue while the ceiling 
has been left white, creating an air of spaciousness to this 
already large room. A portion of the room has been sectioned off 
by a silken partition leading into the closet while set off on 
it's own is a richly-detailed, full-length mirror which has been 
set to reflect the whole room. Two windows flank a larger bay 
window with a cushioned ledge for seating that looks into the 
garden outside, gauzy curtains draped in layers around the 
windowframes which can be tied back by golden, linen ropes. 
   A sliding, wooden door to the west leads out onto a private 
balcony that overlooks the garden.

path itself winds past rosebushes and other flowers before 
branching off west towards the stables. The main branch 
continues on towards the center of the garden where a carved, 
garden bench sits beneath the shade of a large tree, the very 
epitome of an idyllic scene. The sweet scent of flora 
perpetually hangs in the air and along with the vibrant colors of 
the many flowers, serve as a delight to ones senses.

An Expansive, Walled Yard East of a Stables~
   Set near the two westward ends of expanses of the house 
proper, and just east of a well-made stables, this yard is big 
enough to accomodate a few carriages. In the direct center of 
the yard is a round, circular arena, fenced in to allow horse 
lunging or fight training. A few small trees keep it well shaded 
in the full sun. The house stands out tall overhead to the east, 
an imposing structure of form that has been undoubtedly, recently 
built. 
   To the west, a large stable is accessable through the large 
stable doors. Eastwards, a garden sits between the frame of the 
house, an open ended courtyard of sorts. Continuing southward, 
the yard reaches a gate in a stone wall.

   A door to the east permits entrance to this open, wood-beamed 
room, lit by a series of lanterns set into its western wall. 
Wooden stalls line either side of the stables, their floors 
padded with freshly-strewn hay. The northwestern corner is 
dominated by sacks, bushels and barrels of varying sizes. 
Troughs run alongside the individual stalls, nailed to their 
borders firmly. 
   A tall ladder has been proppsed up at the back of the stables 
leading up to the hayloft overhead.

A Hayloft Above the Stables~
   With its ceiling over twenty feet above the floor, this large 
loft can hold hay, straw, and feed for a number of horses. The 
loosely fitted floorboards creak a bit when walked upon but 
appear sturdy enough to bear considerable weight. A ladder 
attached to the south wall runs down through a hole in the floor 
to the main level below.

A Large Stall~
   Walled on all sides by large planks, this is a stall for a horse.
The door slides, being made just like the rest of the walls except
for that detail. A few buckets can be hung from hooks, giving the horse
an easy drink. There is a small trough in the corner, large enough
for grain. The entire floor is hard packed dirt, then dried with lime.
Flecks of sawdust are everywhere. Before a horse is placed in this safe
area, a few inches of sawdust would have to be covering the ground, to
protect the feet.
   Iron bars make up the top half of each wall, and the northern door
can be slid to the side.

   This short stone hallway is dank and dimly lit. A single 
lamp, is attatched securely to the wall at the end of the 
passage. There are four sturdy, iron-braced doors, two on each 
side of the corridor, with a tiny barred window in each. A set 
of narrow stone steps leads upstairs.

   The barracks of the guardhouse are never truly quiet; there is 
always some sound or movement, whether from snoring occupants of 
the beds or activity in one of the other rooms of the building. 
Bunks have been arranged in rows along the walls, with lamps set 
between them, held in place near the ceiling by strong iron 
brackets. The air here is somewhat musty, and smells vaguely of 
sweat and burnt oil. A curtain to the east blocks off another 
section of sleeping quarters, and a stone staircase leads down to 
the first floor.

A Curve in the Old Market West and North~
   This narrow street is dank and dark even at the height of day. 
Despite the mostly-clean roadway, the smell of decay and sewage 
lingers faintly in the air, and occasionally unwary passersby are 
splashed as women empty chamberpots from upper windows. There 
are many shadows that even lamplight does not quite penetrate, 
with few who linger near them, most electing to stay to the 
centre of the cobbled road.

who pass. To the west lays a boarded up building, appearing a 
shattered husk of a thing. Shadows do not hold their place here 
as firmly as the streets themselves, though they do infest the 
spaces between the sides of buildings as well as casting deep 
shadows depending on where the sun sits in the sky.

hide here, looking to have been almost cleaned of anything to 
hide in or behind. Bricks form a high wall to the north, a few 
places have been chipped away to allow for footholds to climb 
over. The buildings are tall and overshadowing, but looking worn 
and dirty, the shutters always closed. Few pass here, and those 
that do never speak of what they see going on.

   A small patch of gardens brings a bit of life to this part of 
the road. It sits along the wall on the west side. The plants 
have been carefully planned and have only enough space to grow, 
no dirt being wasted. Many people pass through here during the 
day, some of the women occasionally stopping to check on a part 
of the gardens. On the eastern side, dingy shops and stalls can 
be seen before the road turns and continues off to the east.

A Road Passing a Solitary Well~
   This area's main focus is the single well which sits in the 
center of the road. It looks to be the main focal-point of the 
area, many people gathered around it drawing up buckets. Though 
the cobbles here have been badly worn down by constant traffic, 
they seem to be better kept than the others, just a few shades 
whiter than the stones away. The laughter of children can be 
heard, and clothes have been strung above the street between the 
houses which line the north and south sides of the street. 
Except at night, the shutters remain open, and this area, though 
poor, seems to give a little cheer to the area surrounding it.

   A tall building looms to the east of here, somewhat 
rundown-looking, with a large gap above the doorway from which 
tendrils of smoky haze often escape and curl into the air 
outside. The crumbling chimney is nearly constantly releasing a 
lazy cloud of billowing woodfire smoke, and occasionally figures 
are seen lingering near the eastern side of the road, some 
permitted in while others are turned away. The cobbles here 
appear somewhat newer, and stretch westward toward more shops and 
housing and southward toward a bend in the road.

An Turn in the Road Stretching North and West~
   Newer cobbles pave this section of the winding road, its width 
halving to the west, widening at the depth of its curve to 
meander northward. Small makeshift shelters are dotted here and 
there along the road's edge, out of the way of the doors that 
open into shops and buildings that have been converted into 
multi-story, multi-family homes. Lines stretch overhead between 
the buildings, often laden with laundry in the warmer months. 
Every once in a while a call overhead will sound, heralding the 
splash of some emptied liquid or another falling onto the road 
below and entering the gutters to be carried away to the sewer.

An Elegant Balcony Overlooking the Ballroom~
   This balcony looks to be big enough to let seven people stand 
on it comfortably, looking out over the ballroom below. Marble 
blocks have been laid together to form the floor, with a dark 
grey stone railing rising up from it. The railings are carved 
with ivy and leaves in a grand display. Several tall potted 
vases sit at both ends of the balcony, the vines of the plants 
intertwine the railings. 
   An ornate, brass spiral staircase allows access to and from 
the balcony.

Commons of the Wayside Tavern~
   With a dirt-stained wooded floor under foot, this room expands 
into the tavern commons. The smell of cheap perfume and smoke 
drifts thickly in the air. The stone walls have been plastered a 
dark brown, the surface uneven and rough to the touch. In a few 
places, subtle scratch marks have been etched into the wall. The 
ceiling is tall enough to give even the tallest man room to stand 
comfortably. Scattered about the room are tables and chairs, 
several are occupied by quiet patrons who chat quietly amongst 
themselves. An old well-worn bar stretches along most of the 
eastern wall, but gives allowance for the stairs going up as well 
as the trapdoor below them. Fastened to the wall are a few lamps 
which glow dully, casting large shadows over the tavern. No 
windows can be seen, the only natural light coming from the 
western door.

   This corridor is quite sparse and poorly lit, with thin 
plaster walls and creaking old flooring. Around the stairwell is 
a simple banister, most of the spindles appearing to have been 
replaced at some point more recently than the thing was 
originally built. A few candles give the area a small amount of 
light, casting great shadows over much of the room. At the end 
of the corridor a large, paneless window has been tightly closed 
over with shutters.

   This corridor is in terrible condition with moldy, 
damp-spotted walls and creaking old flooring. The doors on the 
south and east hang loose from some of their hinges, neither 
looking to do much more than cover the entrance to each room. 
Around the stairwell a thoroughly rotted banister hangs, many of 
the spindles missing or smashed. A few candles give the area a 
small amount of light, casting great shadows over much of the 
room. At the end of the corridor a large window has been 
smashed, the glass having been carefully removed. 
   Rain currently sprays through the window, water dripping down 
the walls nearest to it and dampening the weather-spotted 
hardwood floors. The air also smells strongly of rain and must.

A Dimly-Lit Office~
   The thin walls of this room do little to insulate those inside 
from the noise and weather around, though they appear, along with 
the ceiling, to have been repaired and reinforced enough to keep 
out most of the elements. A gentle sand hue has been painted 
around the lower portion of the walls, with a decorative stained 
wooden border at eye level and a clean pearly white coating the 
remainder of the walls and ceiling above. A single window is set 
into the wall overlooking the street below, its glass appearing 
newer but still bearing grime in its corners, circles having been 
rubbed in each of its panes to allow a view below. The floor is 
a bit slanted and creaky, but most of the boards are sturdy and 
sanded enough. The room is dimply lit by a lamp mounted roughly 
into the wall near the door, hanging a bit loose, as well as a 
few stubs of candles dotted about the room.

   Sage green washes the thin plaster walls that comprise this 
decently-sized room, hardly keeping out the din of the surrounds 
or the tempurature of the outdoors. Faint waterstains mark the 
pearl white ceiling, partially hidden by a natural wooden trim 
that lines the top and bottom corners. The floor is made of the 
same wood, unstained and slightly worn planks mostly free of 
splinters and only creaking in a few areas. A pair of small 
windows are set in the outer wall opposite the door, kept mostly 
clean, a small crack marring the windowsill.

Upon a Large, Battered Roof~
   With wooden tiles underfoot, this rather flat roof shows some 
evidence of travel, a few rows of tiles have been reinforced and 
updated, leaving a relatively safe path across the roof. Two 
stories above the ground, this roof is relatively accessible, and 
a person could jump from rooftop to rooftop if nimble enough. On

   This passageway is just large enough for one person to fit

roughly hewn from the surrounding bedrock, and a bit slick with 
moisture. The musty smell is very strong here, and the smell of 
iron is also in the air. The only way to escape this passage 
other than return from the basement to the north, is to climb out

A Small, Deadend Alley~
   This alley lies near completely obscured behind rubble to the 
west, making it altogether invisible from the main street. 
Seeming to have once been a well-used side entrance to the nearby 
tavern, it now screams of neglect. Broken stone and wood and 
other general refuse lie scattered around the blackened cobbles, 
and little squeaks from within them could lead one to the 
assumption this back alley is home to more than a few creatures. 
The rusted grate that lies against the stone wall of the tavern 
is contrasted by a new-looking lock, and behind it there are 
steps that lead downward into blackness no matter the time of 
day. To the west can be seen a hole that would allow a man to 
pass through to the main lanes of the Old Market, as well as spy 
as to what is lies there while remaining unobserved.

Inside a Tinker's Cart~
   The canvas cover filters the sun's rays to give the interior a 
slightly yellowish hue. Any human would have to crouch to avoid 
the many items suspended from above, and stand sideways to avoid 
bumping the items hung from either side. Even the floor is 
slightly irregular: you stand on several inches of lumber of 
varying quality. Shelves and small bins restrain various smaller 
items near your feet, and a large cabinet in the front of the 
cart extends out to double as a seat for the teamster. Any 
movement on your part will set in motion a chain-reaction of 
clinking as all the larger objects for sale hang along cheap hemp 
cords mere inches away from both you and each other.

A Spacious, Cobbled Courtyard~
   This courtyard has been inlaid with many finely paved cobbles. 
While they have not been engraved, an intricate pattern of white 
and off-white cobbles have been set down to show faint ripples 
stemming out from the fountain in the center to where the cobbles 
continue off to the south, west, and north. At the edges of the 
courtyard, there are three small gardens, a single lamp hanging 
from a tall pole in each one. A tall, limestone fence keeps 
those in the courtyard from being seen, except through a grand 
iron wrought gate. A huge manse can be seen off to the south, 
with a much smaller building able to be seen to the northwest off 
another cobbled yard. 
   A pathway up to the southern buildings porch is visible 
southwards, while the gate leading onto the street is visible to 
the north. Westwards, a hedged side-yard is accessible.

these.

The Embassy Stables~
   This stable is large and well-made with many stalls to hold 
animals. The ground is covered in hay, but the stable is well 
ventilated and does not small overly bad. The stones beneath the 
hay have been set flat and even with each other so as not to 
allow dirt and other things to become caught between the cracks. 
Small windows have been set in the western and eastern walls, 
high on the walls. Occasionally, straw and hay falls through the 
cracks in the high roof above. A wooden ladder leads up to the 
second floor, which looks to be merely a hay loft. 
   To the south, a heavy door leads to the side-yard.

A Beautiful, Fenced-In Riding Yard~
   The grass here has been trampled and is rather brown in spots, 
and bare patches of dirt are also seen clumped about the field. 
The hedge to the east comes to an end at the edge of the yard, 
curling off to the north and south. There are several piles of 
hay and bars set up, as well as a low stone fence which butts up 
against the limestone wall to the north and the west, surrounding 
the property. Off to the north east, a large, dark building can 
be seen though another building farther to the south east looms 
over the entire area. 
   A small gate can be seen at the southwest corner of the yard, 
not large enough to take a horse through it. To the east, a 
hedged in side-yard can be accessed.

A Dirt Pathway Leading to the City Gardens~
   This path is made of packed down dirt, and tall, decorative 
grasses have been set upon both sides of it and look to be 
carefully tended. It is a narrow path, only wide enough for two 
people to walk side by side down it. Looking to the east, the 
stone-grey embassy can be spotted over the hedge-wall standing in 
that direction. No illumination save the natural light of Arda 
grace this pathway, leaving it quite dark on most nights. 
   The path comes from the northern gate, and ends to the west at 
a gate embedded in the wall of the city gardens.

The Embassy Gardens~
   This elegant garden borders the embassy on the eastern and 
southern side of the building, existing in the space in-between 
the building and the limestone walls around it. The plants are 
well tended, and look to be mostly Gondorian, though a few 
examples of more exotic vegetation are visible.

A Serene, Tranquil Garden~
   The area has no cobbles, but a soft, lush grassy bed with 
flowers bordering the area to create a circular pattern of grass. 
Butterflies and other such insects are often seen buzzing around 
through the different flower beds, except in the winter when 
things are tranquil and quiet. a high hedge prevents looking to 
the west and gives the area a serene, closed-off feel. A number 
of subtle, tree-colored lamp posts can be spotted, lighting the 
garden during the night. 
   To the north, an intersection can be seen. To the south, two 
glass-paned doors can be seen at the end of the huge 
white-grey-stone building.

A Marbled Porch Before a Manse~
   The faintly rippled cobbles continue from the north until they 
come to a halt at the edge of the porch. Three dark stoned 
stairs rise up to the level of the grand marble porch, marble 
railings lining the porch's perimeter. The porch itself is large 
enough to let twenty-some people stand comfortably, and four 
stone columns of the ionic have been set up in the center of the 
porch, two on each side. A pair of red-oak doors are embedded in 
the southern wall. On either side of the doors, a large, 
cobra-shaped iron knocker has been affixed to the stone wall. 
   To the south, the giant stone building may be entered, and a 
cobbled pathway leads away to the north.

The Grand Foyer of the Embassy~
   This grand, expansive foyer is made of light-grey stone 
bricks, the ceilings high above arched. Two sets of stairs curl 
down from the second floor, acting as a mirror image of each 
other as they frame the southern doorway. From the top of the 
stairs, many people can look down on the foyer from the walkway 
above. The floor of the foyer is made of marble, and has been 
shined to a glossy finish, expanding northwards towards the 
porch. 
   Large, glass-paned doors head off to the east, a glimpse of 
massive bookshelves visible through them, and opposite them to 
the west are is a finely engraved lebethron door, leading to an 
office. Thick, red oak doors in the northern direction allow 
entrance and exit from the embassy.

A Carpeted Library~
   Though still large, this room is noticeable smaller than the 
foyer to the north-west of it. It expands for a good length in 
the southern direction. A plush, thick carpet has been laid down 
on top of the marble floors here. It is a pale cream carpet, 
contrasting nicely with the rich, mahogany bookshelves which line 
the walls. In the center of the room, four large desks sit 
head-to-head in a circle. The wood on them looking to be the 
same as the bookshelves. On the eastern end of the room, the 
bookshelves part around a large, marble fireplace. Windows are 
abundant on the eastern and northern walls of this room. 
   Towards the north-west of the library, glass doors lead 
towards the expansive foyer.

A Cramped Storage Closet on a Tinker's Cart~
With barely enough room for one to turn about, this storage
closet affords a multitude of shelves, nooks, crannies and
hooks for one to place raw materials, tools and various other
items.  A very narrow door opens to the main room of the
Tinker's Cart to the west. On the northern wall, a very tight
shutter has been placed smartly with a heavy lock.

The Grand Hall~
   This hall is simple massive, easily large enough to hold a 
hundred people, and opulently decorated. The walls are made of 
finely polished stone, and they extend high into the air to meet 
a set of angled glass panels made of glass on all sides, except 
the north. These glass panels hold up the ceiling, which is 
gold-foiled and has an intricately design image of the night sky 
imprinted upon it. The floor is made of gold-swirled marble, 
which has been polished to a fine shine. On the southern wall, a 
tapestry bearing an imposing man's image can be seen. 
   To the east, a set of curtains leads towards the sitting room, 
while the dining room can be seen through an archway in the 
southern wall. Northwards, another archway leads towards the 
foyer, and a servant's entrance is visible to the west.

tapestry~
Depicted in this tapestry is a tall man with a powerful, 
solidly muscular build. His skin is darkly tanned and it 
contributes to the sight of his muscular tone. Dark hair is 
slicked back neatly, and organised hanging to his shoulders. A 
square jaw is lined with a well kept thin line of facial hair. 
The man is armored in finely crafted brigandine, and decorated 
with fine jewelry and an elegant cloak. His expression is stolid 
and stern, giving a feel of his severity and royalty.

A Fancy Dining Room~
   This room extends far in the eastern and western directions, 
but is not too terribly expansive to the south. The walls are 
made of pale-stone bricks, and the floor of polished marble, with 
a long, gold-trimmed rug of crimson draped upon it. A lengthy 
glass window to the south overlooks the gardens around the 
embassy, and allies with numerous fancy lanterns and a fine, gold 
chandelier to provide light to this room. The ceiling is tall 
enough to allow even the tallest beings to stand up fully, but 
extends only a short ways above that clearance. 
   An arch towards the north leads towards the grand hall, while 
a set of large doors to the west allows servers to enter and 
exit.

A Plain, Narrow Hallway~
   The hallway here is only as wide as the opening to the kitchen 
to the west. The ceilings are not as high, though they are 
spacious enough to let people walk easily. The floor is made of 
a low quality marble, and the light-grey stone walls are 
unadorned, and lit only by spartan, bronze lanterns. Servants 
use this as a walkway, and the smell of cooking often wafts out 
from the western direction. 
   At the eastern end of the hallway two large doors can be seen, 
and to the north, another hallway branches off of this one. 
Through the two curtains to the west, an immense kitchen lies.

A Narrow Hallway with a Staircase~
   The walls of this hallway are made of plain, grey stones, held 
together by a white mortar. It is a narrow passage, with a 
ceiling level with the second floor. The floor is set with 
marble of a lower quality, and has been left bare. Servants 
frequent the hall at all hours, though it would not be unheard of 
for one of the dignitaries to use this pathway. It is lit by a 
number of simple bronze lanterns, and by two small windows on the 
western wall, positioned towards the north end of the hallway. 
   Stone stairs on the eastern wall allow access up to the second 
floor, rising upwards towards the north. Next to them, on the 
ground level, a simple door leads to the servant's dormitory. 
The eastern wall has been set with two maroon doors that allow 
servants access to the grand hall to the east. The hallway 
continues to the south where it intersects another hall, heading 
in the east-west direction.

An Immense, Well-Prepared Kitchen~
   This kitchen is immense, both wide and long, with high, arched 
ceilings. An intricate tiled pattern of grey circles amongst a 
sea of white tiles has been laid as the floor and is kept 
immaculately clean. The walls are of bare stone, and in several 
places the walls and ceiling have been blackened and stained with 
soot from fires in the great stoves and fireplaces. Many shelves 
and counters line the sides of the room, creating great 
workspaces for the stoves and ovens which sit between them. Four 
small windows on both the northern and southern walls, as well as 
numerous wall-lamps keep the kitchen well lit. 
   Off to the west, through an arch, a large pantry is able to be 
seen. Large, scarlet curtains separates the kitchen from the 
hallway to the east. A pair glass-paned doors interrupt the wall 
to the north, a small garden is able to be seen through the 
panes.

A Wide, Spacious Pantry~
   This room expands north and south for a good ways, and only a 
short distance westwards, making a rather expansive space. The 
floor is covered in tightly set tiles, which create small grey 
circles on the white floor. The walls are bare stone with 
multiple shelves set in them, with bins set underneath. The 
ceiling is high and hooks hang from the ceiling to facilitate the 
hanging of objects and sacks. Four lanterns, hanging from the 
ceiling, provide light. 
   To the east, an arch gives passage to the main kitchen; while, 
in the center of the room is a trapdoor on the floor. This 
allows access to the cellar.

A Cool, Musty Cellar~
   This cellar has a low ceiling but is otherwise rather large. 
The floor is made of roughly carved stone blocks, with the walls 
made of the same material. The air here is musty and damp, 
though colder than the air in the pantry above. Various shelves, 
racks, and crates have been placed around the room. A single 
lantern hangs from a rope near the center of the room here. 
   A small set of stairs lead up to a iron-banded trapdoor in the 
ceiling, allowing for things to be handed in and out of the 
cellar.

A Fancy Sitting Room~
   The marble floor of this room has been covered with numerous 
bearskins, save for a break around the fireplace, which has been 
set into the northern-western wall. Opposite the fireplace, on 
the southern wall, a tapestry depicts a tense meeting between two 
groups of soldiers. Starting about halfway down the northern and 
southern walls, long panels of glass extend until they meet the 
corners of the eastern wall, where they turn and continue, 
allowing inhabitants to obtain a panoramic view of the gardens 
around the embassy. 
   To the west, an archway filled with crimson curtains leads 
towards the grand hallway.

tapestry~
This finely crafted tapestry depicts a number of 
chainmail-clad Gondorian soldiers facing off a Haradaic army, 
though neither side appears to be readying for battle. A 
campground has been set in-between them, but no one lingers in it 
now. Mumak are present on the Haradaic side, and horses can be 
found in both parties. The background is a road, set just north 
of a bridge.

The Ambassador's Office~
   This room is not too expansive, but it is certainly not small. 
Red-oak paneling has been set into the floor, and the walls have 
been plastered and painted a delicate crimson color. A desk, 
made of lebethron, sits near the western wall. A number of 
windows can be seen on the northern and western wall, and on the 
southwestern a fireplace has been installed, to provide warmth. 
Two fine glass lamps are mounted behind the desk, allowing the 
room to remain lit at night. Between the lamps, a painting 
depicts four figures standing between two groups of soldiers, 
conversing. 
   A exceptionally-crafted door to the east leads towards the 
foyer of the embassy.

painting~
   This image depicts four people meeting between two separate 
gatherings of soldiers, one Gondorian, one Haradaic. On the 
Haradaic side, an imposing, powerfully-built man stands with an 
air of royalty to him, a sloe-eyed woman flaking him to the left. 
Both are armored, though the man's armor is clearly of a finer 
make. On the Gondorian side, two Dunedain, also in armor, stand, 
one, a platinum-eyed man with black hair, in the front, and the 
other, a slender, flint eyed man, stands deferentially behind the 
first man. A table is visible nearby the men, and the sun is 
high in the air - the meeting is occurring north of a bridge, in 
the middle of a road. The armies behind the group of four are 
depicted as tense, and well armed, some narrowed eyes visible.

At the Top of a Grand Staircase~
   Two beautifully designed staircases extend from the foyer up 
to the walkway, each curving slightly so the do not block the 
southern exit of the foyer below. The steps are made from 
marble, and a crimson silken rug with a golden trim has been 
draped over them. The guardrails are carved into a smooth, 
complex design. The walkway itself has marble flooring, with 
another crimson rug with golden fringe running down it's length. 
An iron fence has been installed at the edge of the walk, to 
prevent accidents. Stolid, ionic columns interrupt the fencing 
at even intervals, supporting the building. 
   A masterfully crafted doorway leads to a suite in the southern 
direction, and the walkway continues in both the eastern and 
western directions.

Approaching a Room Near the Southeastern Corner of the Walkway~
   The marble walkway overlooking the foyer turns from north to 
west here. Two rugs, crimson trimmed with gold in color, overlap 
at the intersection, one extending northwards, and the other 
westwards. Sturdy stone columns of the ionic design stand at the 
edge of the walkway, coupled with iron fencing to prevent anyone 
from falling off into the foyer below. 
   To the west, the grand staircase can be found, while to the 
north, the walkway continues. Eastwards, a door in the stone 
wall leads to a small suite.

Along an Open Walkway, Looking Down on the Foyer~
   Even spaced ionic columns made of a pale grey, linked with 
polished iron fencing, form a perimeter at the edge of the 
walkway. The eastern wall, constructed from a similar stone as 
the one used for the columns, has a strong door set into it. The 
flooring is made from a fine marble, and a golden trimmed rug of 
crimson has been draped over it, leading in the north-south 
direction. 
   A reinforced door embedded in the eastern wall leads towards 
the suite of a military man.

The Northeast Corner of the Walkway, Before a Suite~
   The marble walkway turns to the south here, and a small 
doorway is visible in the stone wall to the east. Two crimson 
rugs, trimmed in gold, converge in the corner, one of the rugs 
heading from north to south, and the other from east to south. 
Along the end of walkway, partitions of fencing are connected by 
ionic column of stone. 
   The walkway around the foyer continues to the south and the 
west, and to the east, a doorway leads to a single room suite.

On the Walkway, Before a Pair of Suites~
   The walkway straightens now as it approaches a break in the 
stone-brick wall to the north. To the south, upon the edge of 
the walkway, polished iron guard rails and beautiful ionic 
columns made of a light grey stone form a defensive barrier, 
protecting those who traverse the walkway from falling accidents. 
On the floor, a gold trimmed rug, colored crimson, lays upon the 
marble flooring. 
   To the north, a corridor grants access to two small suites. 
Eastwards and westwards the walkway turns to the south.

At the Northwestern Corner of the Walkway~
   Well-built columns of stone, designed in the ionic order, line 
the perimeter of the walkway, with lengths of fencing set in 
between each pillar. The floor of the walkway is made of a fine 
marble. On top of the marble, two rugs have been placed, one 
running from north to south, and one from east to west, 
overlapping in the corner. Each is crimson in color, and trimmed 
with gold. 
   The walkway extends towards the south and east, and the foyer 
is visible across the guard rail.

Nearing an Elegant Room Alongside the Walkway~
   A finely crafted iron fence, with elegant ionic columns made 
of stone inserted in-between, stands at the tip of the walkway, 
preventing calamity. On the marble floor of the walkway, a 
crimson rug, trimmed with gold, has been placed. The rug runs in 
the south-north direction, and continues the entire length of the 
walkway, towards the turns to the north and south. 
   Towards the west, a masterfully made doorway leads towards a 
suite of rooms, and the walkway continues in the northern and 
southern directions.

Close to the Servant's Stairway Along the Walkway~
   As the corner approaches, the gold-trimmed scarlet rug laid 
upon the marble floor of this walkway ends, and is replaced by a 
new rug, this one running from south to north around the corner. 
Standing between the end of the walkway and the foyer below, a 
sturdy iron fence guards against falls. Beautifully crafted 
columns, of the ionic order, divide the fence in even intervals, 
bearing the weight of this building. 
   To the north the walkway expands around the foyer, while to 
the east, the grand stairway can be found. A small set of stairs 
can be found in the depths of the corner, leading towards the 
ground floor.

A Large, Cozy Dormitory~
   This dormitory is large enough to fit a number of bunk beds, 
and is constructed from simple stone bricks. The ceiling is high 
and undecorated, as are the walls. The floor is made of a simple 
marble, and rugs have been laid out to give it a bit of warmth. 
It is clean and well-kept, though a bit of dust can be found 
swept under one of the rugs. A chandelier with a visible fault 
in its side hangs from the ceiling, providing light. The 
chandelier is joined by two small windows on the western wall. 
Two tables have been set in the middle of the room, chairs 
circled around them. 
   To the south, a simple, carved door has been put in place to 
allow entrance and exit.

An Oppulant Anteroom~
   This elegant anteroom is encased in stone walls, and carpeted 
with an exotic, red-fox-fur rug, the first hint to its wealth. 
No windows can be found in this chamber, but in each corner, a 
finely formed glass lamp is mounted, providing light to the room. 
A fireplace also can be located in this room, slight to the 
northern side of the western wall, a buffer zone of bare marble 
flooring surrounding it. Various pieces of cushy furniture have 
been arrayed in this room for entertaining. 
   To the north, a small office is accessible by a door, and to 
the south, another door lead to the bedroom. A little ways south 
of the fireplace, a set of scarlet curtains lead to the bathing 
room.

An Eloquent Private Office~
   This private office has stone walls like the rest of the 
embassy, but it is floored with well-polished oak panels, upon 
which a lambskin rug has been set. Towards the northern end of 
the room, a desk and some chairs are placed, and behind them, on 
the northern wall, a bookshelf of fine wood has been set. To the 
east and west of the bookshelf, small windows allow the light to 
enter the room, joined by another pair of windows on the western 
side of the room. 
   To the south, a sturdy wooden door leads to the anteroom of 
the suite.

An Elegant Bathing Room~
   A porcelain tub has been set in the center of this bathing 
room. Its walls are stone in material, with no windows visible. 
The only light provided to the room is the illumination of dim, 
crimson-glass lanterns, numbering twelve. The floor has been 
laid with maroon tiles, each seeming to have been placed very 
neatly. 
   To the east, scarlet curtains allow access to the center of 
the suite.

A Luxurious Bedroom~
   This bedroom is adorned well, made of masterfully-polished oak 
floorboards and white-grey stone bricks. Four windows, two to 
the western wall, and two to southern wall, provide light during 
the hours of the sun; when the moon reigns, wall-lamps give their 
light to the room. A lambskin rug has been laid just west of the 
center of the room, making space for the bed, which rests against 
the eastern wall. A sizable closet can be seen in the 
northeastern corner of the room. 
   To the north, a doorway allows one to pass back into the 
anteroom of this suite.

A Leather-Padded Private Gym~
   This expansive room was built from pale grey stone bricks, 
like the rest of the embassy, but they not readily visible, for 
the entire room, walls, floor, and ceiling included, have been 
covered in thick, soft leather padding. No furniture or 
obstacles can be found in the center of the room, though a number 
of armor stands and weapon racks have been set upon the northern 
and southern walls. On top of the leather padding on the floor, 
a large circle has been marked with a thick line of crimson 
paint. No windows light this room, but a fleet of bright lamps 
has been mounted to the walls to provide illumination. 
   To the west, a stolid door leads to the walkway, while 
curtains lead eastwards to a bedroom.

and a wide pathway leads through the garden to a few seating

   Rows of plants line this small garden off to the western side. 
A large white-washed stone wall butts up against the western wall 
leading to the Second Circle. A few trees provide some shade in 
the garden. A cellar door is set against the base of the 
northern wall of the building. Wide paths lead through the lines 
of the garden plots, making it easier to tend. Along the 
white-washed gate to the east grow various shrubs and flowers, 
partly to decorate, partly to provide added privacy.

A Dingy Hovel~
   This decrepit dwelling is suitable for only the most desperate 
of people. Thick layers of filth and grime cover nearly every 
surface of this room, giving the distinct impression that none 
have lived here in a very long time. Mold clings to the walls, 
almost seeping out of the cracks in the material. While odd bits 
and pieces of furniture and debris cover the floor, a distinctly 
travelled path has been made towards the back end of the room. 
Though the ceiling is caked nearly as bad with dirt, there is a 
faintly visible outline.

been banded with a thin layer of steel, and almost perfectly 
recessed into the ceiling. In the dim, usually non-existent 
lighting of the room it is very hard to see. One edge of the 
trapdoor is a bit more exposed than the others, allowing a person 
to slip their fingers inside.

A Hidden Room above a Hovel~
   Although in a semi-broken state, this small room is far better 
off than the dwelling below. Repairs have been clearly made and 
set into place along the walls, and even the ceiling boasts newer 
looking birchwood boards. The windows set into the eastern wall 
are boarded up. Despite this, there is a set of strategically 
seperated boards allowing a somewhat reduced view of the streets

BONES Rooftop~
   As with the surrounding buildings this rooftop slants 
downwards at a semi-steep angle, allowing rainfall to be siphoned 
away. With the old roofing material all but worn away, one can 
see the newer lumber below, used to effect repairs. Carefully 
recessed handholds have been set into the roof, allowing one to 
keep themselves in place. Partially hidden by the roofing, a 
small hatch is set into place, painted carefully to match the 
surroundings. Other portions of the roof are in good repair, 
some even allowing passage to nearby buildings if one can make 
it.

A Curve in the Slums South and West~
   Standing before a rather new looking portcullis, this stretch 
of slums is lit by the lanterns set upon the portal. At least 
some effort has been made to renew the cobblestone surface, 
evidence of portions being pried away and replaced made apparent 
by small piles of stone. Trash and debris are kept to a minimum 
here, no doubt maintained as best as possible by those of the 
Cityworkers. Passing west through the gateway moves into the 
remains of the old Great Market. Moving southwards is the road 
further into the slums, where the quality shown here degrades 
rapidly.

A Partially Blocked Alley Entrance~
   Connected to the main road to the west by a barely noticeable 
break in the masonry, the entrance to this back alley is in a far 
worse state than the slums it is near to. Garbage ranging from 
simple scrap material, to even molded remains of food lay strewn 
about in random clumps. With a narrow passage to the west, the 
easier path for most would be further into the alley. Overhead 
the rooftops of the surrounding buildings press close to the 
southern wall, limiting the light in the alley even during the

A Color-Stained Length of Alley~
   Although the windows to the north remain tightly bolted, this 
back alley is most often lit by the singular lamp hanging from 
the second level. With a dim glow unveiling the surroundings, 
lack of care is made evident. The cobblestone of the alleyway is 
broken, and in in some places stained a multitude of colors. 
There is even a small mark upon the southern wall, randomly 
placed waist level. Bits of broken glass lay scattered about, 
oriented mainly near the stained rock.

   This portion of the alley is actually quite well kept. For 
roughly the length of the building to the north, the cobblestones 
remain swept and free of debris. The windows on the building 
posess a set of iron bars, and the door into the shop is well 
made. Two lanterns hang from the face of the building, keeping 
the area illuminated at all times. To the west stretches a short 
length of alley, while an elbow in the 'road' east might guide

A Darkened Path Through the Alley~
   This stretch of cobblestone is set between the city wall to 
the east, and the sheer unbroken wall of a building to the west. 
No windows or access are visible on the wall, and the only 
illumination comes from the city walls above. What light does 
reach the stones of the path underfoot is broken and flickering, 
potentially limiting visibility. Being so concealed from the 
city proper, most sound is muted in this alleyway.

Between Two Walls, Heading North and South~
   Hidden from view by a stone wall to the west and the city wall 
to the east, there is little present in this stretch of alleyway. 
Debris litters the ground ranging from burned out torches, to 
remnants of now rotted foodstuffs. Light is unreliably provided 
from above, leaving this part of the alley quite often dark at 
night. The path stretches north a short ways, while to the south 
the cobblestones cut sharply west.

Next to a Well-Built Building~
   A smattering of light drowns the area, casting odd shadows on 
the rubble and remains of various stones. This narrow alleyway 
is kept out of the way, sealed off from the streat proper. To 
the west, the stone foundation meets wooden frame of a large 
structure. Metallic footsteps can often be heard far above, from 
atop the wall. 
   To the north, the alleyway curves west and south. To the 
south the alleyway continues, stopping at a sharp corner.

A Section of Alley Going West and South~
   The sharp, elbow-shaped turn is well lit. From above, a 
lantern shines down from the wall, a guard post in place those 
many meters up. Bits of refuse and rubble cover the ground, the 
former being from careless guards on duty. The latter is simply 
time. Time has worn the wall smooth here, giving no purchase to 
those seeking the perilous task of climbing. 
   To the west, the alley turns into another sharp elbow, the 
area littered with chunks of misshappen rock. To the south the 
alleyway stretches on briefly before turning the same.

A Rubblestrewn Curve Stretching North and East~
   The entire alleyway is covered with rubble and pieces of 
stone. Though no door exists on the building to the south, there 
is a window on the second story. A bit of light is able to be 
seen at night, provided by the guardpost high above the alley 
corner to the east. Sounds of metal on stone are often echoing 
about the area. Mixed in with the hunks of rock are blunted 
pieces of metal, and scrapped handles of wood. 
   To the north, the alley stretches a short while. To the east, 
another curve in the alleyway is visible.

A Slightly Widened Section of the Alley~
   As wide as a man and then half again, this alleyway provides 
exactly what it was created for; passage. With a clear, straight 
path along eld, worn cobblestones it leads behind shops and 
homes. Though the echo of boots above can often be heard, no 
lantern shines doen on this area at night. Enclosed as it is, 
the sounds other side of the buildings to the west are muted and 
hidden. Any noise made in this area however, will resound easily 
in such tight quarters. 
   To the north, the alley stretches on a little further before 
coming to an apparent end. To the south is an S-curve in the 
alley.

Amid Piles of Garbage~
   Ensconced by high buildings to the west, and the massive wall 
of the city to the east, this stretch of alley lays close to the 
mouth to the north. The only things that are out of place here 
are broken boards and sodden bits of garbage that sully the 
otherwise clean alleyway. Muted bootsteps can often be heard 
from above, due to the secluded nature of the alley. 
   To the north, the alleyway continues on, leading eventually to 
the entrance. To the south the cobblestones lead further into 
it.

A Poorly Maintained Stretch of Cobblestone~
   As with the rest of the alley, this section is muted and cut 
off from the city proper by the high wall to the east and the 
buildings to the west. Shards of broken glass and brick chips 
spatter the cobblestones. The windows to the west have been 
heavily boarded up, and no light shines out from behind them. 
   The alleyway continues briefly north, while to the south an S 
curve is faintly visible.

Passing a Decrepit Building~
   In heavy disrepair, this stretch of secluded cobblestone is 
covered with rotten boards and misshapen bricks. Small, 
partially paned window frames lay against the western building, 
signifying ongoing construction. Though it is very much an often 
deserted area, lanterns hang down from the Wall above, light for 
the guards whom patrol it shining down occasionally. 
   To the north, the alleyway comes to an abrupt end. The 
southern path leads into the alley further.

The Closed Mouth of the Alley~
   The sharp scent of freshly tanned leather floats from this 
section of the alleyway. Scraps of hide and broken bits of 
thread are heaped in a pile here and there. Though sounds of 
daily traffic can be heard to the north, there is no clear way to 
pass through. Lit from above by a hanging lantern, this section 
of the alleyway remains visible at all times of the day. High 
windows are marked near the top of the first level, to the west. 
Higher up still, more openings are presnt, paned by thick glass. 
   To the north, the mouth of the alleyway remains closed off. 
To the south leads further into the narrow passageway.

A Spacious, Rectangular Training Room~
   Light, grey stones make up the smooth floor and walls of this 
spacious, rectangular-shaped room. The ceilings are high-vaulted 
enough so that climbing ropes may be attached onto the walls with 
a climbing wall dominating the eastern side. Sturdy, wooden 
racks filled with weapons of various types, training targets, and 
dummies have been arranged throughout this training room while 
bins of padded armor have been piled into a corner. A corner of 
the room has been curtained, allowing for people to change in 
privacy.
   Westwards, through the open double archway can be seen a 
long archery hall. Eastwards, the doors allow access back into 
the lobby.

A Medium-Sized Stone Bedroom~
   Walls of stone define the boundaries of this bedroom, with two 
windows in each wall, saving the western one, which instead has a 
doorway. Wolfskin rugs cover the entirety of the floor, all of 
them shades of grey or white. A well made bed has been placed 
against the northern wall, in between the windows, and a closet 
stands opposite it on the southern wall. On the eastern wall, a 
break in the wolfskin carpeting surrounds a small fireplace. 
   To the west, a doorway with scarlet curtains leads towards the 
private gym, and eventually the walkway.

The Suite Off the Southeastern Walkway~
   This small suite has walls of a light grey stone, and 
floorboards made of skillfully prepared oak. A simple lambskin 
rug lays on top of the floor in the center of the room, and north 
of it, a small stove has been installed to keep it's occupants 
warm. Four windows, two on the eastern wall, and two on the 
southern, provide light while the sun lingers in the sky, and two 
glass lamps keep the room lit at night. A single bed rests 
against the southern wall, opposite the stove, with a chest at 
its foot. 
   A doorway to the west leads towards the walkway overlooking 
the foyer.

A Corridor Off the Walkway~
   This corridor is made of grey stone bricks, held together by a 
smoothed, white mortar. A single window spans about two-thirds 
the length of the northern wall, overlooking the path leading up 
to the embassy. A rug leading from the walkway to the south, 
crimson in color with a gold trim, overlaps a similar rug running 
from the eastern end of this corridor to the western end. 
   At both ends of the corridor, sturdy engraved doors lead to 
small suites.

The Western Suite off the Corridor~
   This room has walls made of a grayish stone, and fine oak 
floorboards are set in place under feet. A lambskin rug lays in 
the center of the room, a stove standing north of it, and a bed 
and chest south of it. To the west, two windows allow one to 
look upon the City Gardens, while to the north, another two 
windows provide a view of the pathway leading up to the embassy. 
A pair of glass lamps are mounted upon the walls to ensure that 
the room does not fall dark during the hours when the sun rests. 
   To the east, an oak door leads towards the corridor.

wall, shine light into this room, and allow one to see the Moon 
Plaza to the east, and the path leading up to the embassy to the

source of light. The walls themselves are constructed from 
stone, and the floor is made of oaken panels, with a lambskin rug 
lying in the center of the room. A small stove has been set 
against the northern wall, and opposite it, a bed and chest lay 
against the northern wall. 
   A door in the western wall leads towards the corridor

A Sand-Filled Sunroom~
   A sloped glass done curves from the western stone walls of the 
building down towards the eastern edge, held up by a fine, steel 
frame. The sunlight pours easily into this room, lighting it 
quite brightly during the day. A number of small, bronze lamp 
posts are arrayed across the large room, providing a soft light 
during the night time. The entire floor of this room has been 
filled with a layer of sand, except for a small, elevated marble 
platform near the door. 
   In the northwestern corner, a curtain of the same color as the 
sand on the floor leads towards the antechamber.

A Splendid Dining Room~
   This private dining room is defined by sturdy, grayish-white 
stone walls. Its floor is made of well-polished wooden planks, 
left unadorned by any rugs or carpets. No windows can be found 
within this room, but each doorway is flanked by two lanterns, 
and a very large, masterfully crafted chandelier hangs from the 
center of the room, filled with a small army of candles. A large 
tapestry displayed on the southern wall depicts two men in the 
wilderness. 
   A door leads eastwards towards a small bedroom, and westwards 
to the master bedroom.

tapestry~
Two men are captured in this image, both of about equal 
height. The man on the right is of an imposing build, with tan 
skin and dark eyes. He wears well-adorned bronze platemail, and 
his expression is stern and unrevealing. The other figure is 
more slender, and wears a suit of leather-wrapped chainmail. His 
eyes are grey, indicating his Numenorean heritage. The two 
figures are standing near a road, and visible in the background 
are two armies, standing at attention.

A Luxurious Private Bathing Room~
   This small room off of the master bedroom houses a porcelain 
tub within its stone walls. Scarlet tiles have been laid onto 
the floor of this bathing room, not a single one appearing to be 
out of place in the least. A dozen red-glass lanterns keep the 
room lit with a dim, maroon light. 
   Scarlet curtains allows passage to the bedroom south of here.

An Exquisite Master Bedroom~
   Clearly, an excessive amount of wealth has been poured into 
this bedroom. The walls are made of a pale-grey stone, held 
together by a neatly spread mortar. The western and southern 
walls have eight windows, split equally between them, 
complimented by a large, finely-made lantern, which hangs from 
the ceiling. The floor is made of finely polished lebethron 
planks, covered by an intricately patterned rug. In the very 
center of the room is a four-poster bed constructed of mahogany, 
facing the northern wall. A small partition has been closed off 
in the north-eastern corner, leading towards a bathing room. 
   A small hallway in the southeast corner of the room leads 
towards the closet to the south, and allows exit to the dining 
hall to the east.

A Long and Spacious Closet~
   Constructed from off-white stone, and extending a good ways to 
the south, this closet is quite extravagant. The closet has no 
windows, but it is well lit by a set of lanterns that hang from 
the roof. A thick, furry rug covers the ground, and shoe racks 
line both the eastern and western walls. Above them, pegs and 
racks can be found for the storage of all sorts of garments. 
   To the north, a door made of rosewood leads back to the 
bedroom. One might notice another doorway, covered in curtains, 
embedded into the eastern wall towards the southern end of the 
room.

The Suite Off the Northeastern Walkway~
   Made of white-grey stone bricks and polished oak floorboards, 
this small room is equipped for residence. A small stove has 
been set on the southern wall for the purpose of heating, and a 
bed with a chest at its foot opposes it on the northern wall. 
Two pairs of windows, one set on the eastern wall and one on the 
northern wall, work with twin glass-lamps to constantly 
illuminate this suite. On the center of the floor, a rug of 
lambskin has been laid. 
   To the west, a door leads to the walkway around the foyer.

The Antechamber to an Extravagant Suite~
   This antechamber is walled with stone, and carpeted with a 
finely crafted rug. A fireplace has been built into the western 
wall, with a small partition of porcelain tiles surrounding it, 
forming a small buffer. Four small windows, two on the western 
wall, and two on the eastern wall, allow light to flow in during 
the day. A number of chairs and couches are arranged around a 
small table in this antechamber, and the walls are decorated with 
various pieces of art. 
   An exquisite, gold-inlaid door to the north allows exit from 
the suite back onto the walkway. A southern arch leads further 
into the suite, and a small, sand-hued silk curtain in the 
south-east corner leads towards the sun room.

Before a Large, Two-Story Manse~
   A short, but wide path leads up to the steps of a two-story 
manse and though it looks to be a new structure, already little 
vines creep up the sides of the home. The path winds westwards 
around the house, lined with small, grey stones separating it 
from the green grass that grows here. This area is rather bare 
in comparison to the grand home to the north, carved, double 
doors allowing one access within while to the south, a 
wrought-iron gate leads back out to the Plaza of the Moon.

A Stone-Lined Path Around the Manse~
   The path leads north and east here around the corner of the 
manse, walled in by neatly-trimmed hedges planted before a stone 
wall that rises in to enclose the whole of the manse. The path 
itself is hard-packed dirt lined with grey stones to separate it 
from the lush, green grass that grows closer to the wall. Vines 
work their way up the stone of the enclosure behind the hedges 
and the sounds of the Moon Plaza beyond it drift in with the 
breeze. 
   North, the path leads to a stable while east leads to the 
front of the home.

A Clothing-Lined Closet~
   Upon entering this closet, one's senses are nearly overwhelmed 
with color as hooks, shelves, and other containers for clothing 
and accessories line every inch of the walls of this room from 
floor to ceiling. Dresses, pants, and other clothing in fabrics 
ranging from cotton to silk have been delicately hung or folded 
in proper place while along the bottom portion of one of the 
walls, a shoe rack has been built. There is enough room here to 
maneuver about and try on clothing and tucked in the corner near 
the entrance is a little vanity table and chair, an oval mirror 
hanging above it affixed to the wall. 
   A silken partition separates this closet from the master 
bedroom.

A Plain Bedroom~
   This small room is furnished spartanly, unlike the rest of the 
suite. The walls are made of a white-grey stone, and have been 
left unadorned. A large, bearskin rug has been laid in the 
center of this room, covering a decent portion of the polished 
wooden planks that the floor is made of. The southern wall has 
been left completely bare, but one of the stone bricks has no 
mortar bordering it, though it remains in alignment with the 
other stones. 
   To the west, a door leads towards the suite's private dining 
room.

A Curved, Stone Passage~
   Windowless and narrow, this stone passage is only large enough 
for one person to pass at a time. The stone blocks that form the 
passage are thick, and grey-white in color. The small ceiling 
forms a curved arch, and hangs just low enough to force those of 
a taller stature to cower down some. 
   As the passage bends northwards, it comes to an abrupt stop 
before a thick wooden door in a stone wall. A lever can be seen 
at chest height on the western side of the door.

At the Top of the Stairs~
   This small common area sits at the top of a set of wood and 
stone steps. Though large enough for multiple individuals to 
pass through at once, it is designed for passage and not 
dwelling. To the east and west are large rooms, each able to 
hold several individuals. Below, a large stone floor stretches 
out over the entirety of the building.

There is room for perhaps half a dozen beds, and complimentary 
furniture. There is little adornment in the room, other than the

A Small Dormitory~
   Roughly twenty paces by ten, this dormitory has been 
constructed from sturdy birchwood and stone. A single support of 
oak wood stands in the center of the room, no more than a 
handspread broad. The roof is well insulated and well made. 
Little marks this room other than the image of a trade cart on 
the empty doorframe.

A Large Warehouse~
   This large open space takes up the majority of the warehouse 
floor. Newly built, or perhaps simply newly repaired, the stone 
floors of the area are quite solid. Birch supports enclose the 
structure, with the same again as their walls. Though not all 
together impressive by itself, the warehouse is large enough that 
it can hold a number of individual, or items. In the back of the 
room, a set of stairs leads upwards to rooms above.

A Small, Rebuilt Shelter~
   A large open area comprised this newly repaired shelter. For 
those sitting about, it can hold a dozen or so individuals at a 
time. The walls have been repaired and the place has been swept 
clean. To the north and west are dormitories and to the east is 
a door that leads to the clinic. A small trapdoor near the 
northwest corner of the room leads down into a cellar.

A Formal Entryway~
   The stone walls of this formal corridor are lined, floor to 
ceiling, with cherry-wood panelling and a small crest embellished 
with the stylized image of a single rose, framed on either side 
by a curved laurel branch, has been carved into the single, stone 
block left visible in the wall above the arched, ebonwood door. 
The words FAITH - TRIUMPH - LOYALTY are scribed in curving 
Numenian-Tengwar script that follows the curve of the laurel 
branches. The burgundy-hued carpet that runs the length of the 
entryway muffles the sound of footsteps when people pass through 
while a circular, ironwork chandelier embellished with decorative 
spirals and colourful-glass beads is suspended from the ceiling 
and illuminates the space with a warm, golden light. A stairwell 
provides egress to the upper floor of the manor.

A Sedate, Wood-Panelled Study~
   The cherrywood panelling and floor-to-ceiling bookcases of the 
same wood that line the stone walls lend to the solemn atmosphere 
of this room. Aside from the myriad of books, tomes, and folios 
that line the shelves, the walls bear little decoration. A 
single glass-paned window, strategically reinforced on the inside 
with ironwork bars, allows a small amount of natural light into 
the room during daylight hours when its burgandy-hued drapes are 
left open. Several, well-placed pieces of furniture provide 
ample comfort to the room's occupants, encouraging long periods 
of study and reflection.

A Bright, Bay-Windowed Solar~
   Numerous glass-paned windows, completely devoid of curtains, 
line the white-stone walls of this airy space. A plush-cushioned 
divan strategically built out from the wall beneath the large, 
bay window overlooking the gardens provides the room's occupants 
with a place to lounge in comfort while enjoying the view. Aside 
from a few potted plants situated here and there throughout the 
space, the room seems noticeably devoid of actual plantlife. In 
its place, a large mural of a lush garden scene has been painted 
on the wall opposite the bay window, complete with a pond dotted 
with small, tangled-clumps of stylized blue water lilies.

A Sensuously-Appointed Sitting Room~
   Great attention to detail has been paid to the decoration and 
furnishing of this softly-lit room whose stone walls bear no 
windows, its illumination provided by several glass-beaded 
lanterns affixed to the cherry-wood panelling. Plush carpeting 
of a deep-umber hue covers the floor and complements the 
richly-coloured panelling that stretches from floor to ceiling. 
The large fireplace, which provides warmth on cool days, and the 
richly-coloured fabrics of the plush cushions and upholstery, 
speak to the senses and lend themselves to the inviting 
atmosphere of the space.

A Well-Appointed Kitchen~
   More functional than decorative, this modest-sized kitchen's 
white stone walls have been left bare aside from the 
strategically placed racks and shelves which display all manner 
of cooking implements and foodstuffs. A pair of wood-shuttered 
windows, their glass-panes reinforced from the inside with 
ironwork bars, provide the workspace with fresh air and ample 
light during the daylight hours. In spite of the room's spartan 
appearance, the large fireplace situated in one of the corners 
helps to create a welcoming atmosphere when its hearth blazes 
with a crackling fire. No attention to detail has been spared 
when furnishing the room; its counters, cupboards and other 
pieces of equipment have been arranged for easy access and 
efficiency.

A High-walled Garden~
   This small greenspace is completely walled off from the 
outside world; the sounds of the hustle and bustle of the nearby 
plaza are muffled by the high, stonework walls. The shrubs and 
greenery of the modest-sized garden appear to have been chosen 
for their hardiness and ability to flourish without constant 
tending. Dense shrubbery borders the space completely save for 
the wide gap providing egress to the back of the manor and 
another less obtrusive gap. A rectangular patch of grass 
situated in the midst of the verdant plantlife provides a 
welcoming spot to lounge or picnic when weather permits.

shrubbery. The sounds and sights of the rest of the garden are 
veiled and muffled by the verdant greenery, save for a very

easily overlooked by those on the outside. A solitary, 
colourful-glass-beaded lantern affixed to an iron pole

   A narrow, umber-hued carpet runs the length of the corridor 
and muffles the sound of footsteps whenever anyone passes through 
on their way to or from the private chambers situated here on the 
top floor of the manor. Several well-placed lanterns affixed to 
the cherry-panelled walls illuminate the space with a soft, 
golden light. The somber-hued decor and spartan furnishings lend 
to the sober atmosphere of the upstairs hallway that has been 
carried up from the formal entry hall situated at the bottom of 
the stairwell.

   Plush, burgundy-hued carpeting covers the floor of this 
spacious sleeping chamber and complements the rich-umber-painted, 
stone walls. The somber-hued decor and fine-fabric upholstery of 
the room's furnishings speaks to the occupant's taste for 
understated elegance. Umber-hued drapes cover a large, 
glass-paned window that has been strategically reinforced from 
the inside with decorative ironwork bars. Floor-length swaths of 
burgundy-hued fabric, affixed to the iron ring suspended from the 
ceiling, cascade and drape about the bed creating an intimate 
nook when drawn shut.

A Grand Entry-hall~
   With five great pillars of white stone and floors of polished 
granite, the entry hall to this large structure is truly massive 
in size. Nearly thirty paces from the door to the rising 
stairwell, and two thirds of that wide, there is ample room for a 
great number of people to stand in place. Iron sconces and hooks 
have been tastefully put into place in the recesses of the hall. 
The high ceiling opens along its outer edge, allowing fresh air 
and light to enter, whilst the slight hood of stone over each 
alcove prevents preciptation from entering overmuch. The five 
pillars have been set so that four form a square, and one is laid 
in the center of the hall. At the far end of the hall, the wide 
steps stretch from nearly one side of the room to the other, and 
lead up to a grande chamber.

A Grand, Tree-lined Courtyard~
   Made of the same fine white cobblestone found elsewhere in the 
city, this courtyard is of reasonable size to accomodate most 
group sizes. In one corner, almost immediately after the western 
gates, a fair-sized stable has been constructed of the finest 
oak. The stone near it has worn down from repeated travel, but 
the entire area remains in good repair. A small number of 
youthful trees have been planted, spaced out as a sort of pathway 
leading through the courtyard. Walls nearly half again the 
height of a man surround the courtyard, ridged iron spines set at 
regular intervals to discourage unwanted visitors. The hall to 
the east is large, masterfully rebuilt from the ruin that was an 
eld Fellowship hall. 
   To the east, a grand pair of lebethron-wood doors leads into 
the entry hall of the building. To the west, a steel-barred gate 
sections this area off from the Moon Plaza.

A Sturdy Oak Stable~
   Solid oak beams support this stable, each one carved plain. 
With stalls enough for perhaps a dozen horses, it is not the 
largest of structures, yet large enough for a small party. Hay, 
both old and new, can be seen covering the insides of each stall, 
as well as the bales of hay found often at the far end of the 
stables. The surface beneath the golden straw is white 
cobblestone, each one worn nearly smooth by time and the 
elements. 
   At the far end of the stable, an opening leads to the 
courtyard of the premises.

An Opulent, Massive Entry Hall~
   The walls and pillars of this entry hall are made from large 
white stones. Each has been shaped individually to provide a 
smooth and pitless surface. Stretching at least ten paces each 
way from the sides of the massive lebethron doors, the hall 
covers nearly three times that end to end. Above the west-most 
doorway, a broad scene of colored glass has been set into the 
stone. Six figures are set into portions of black-tinted glass, 
their details lost to any casual gaze. Set at regular intervals, 
three pairs of white pillars line the entry hall, each hung with 
their own banners. The stone of the floor has been carefully 
chiseled and carved, a deep-set rendering of the White Tree open 
for all to see. 
   To the west, a pair of lebethron doors lead out of the entry 
hall, whilst a wide set of stairs leads upwards into another part 
of the structure.

glass~
   This broad stained-glass scene stretches across the top of 
western wall of the entry hall. The main color is a vibrant 
blue, light taking on a gentle hue as it is filtered through. 
Side by side, depicted in black-tinted glass are six tall 
figures. Though nothing can be seen of their features, in the 
center of each one is a symbol formed of pure white glass. There 
is no order or favored position of any figure. The one on the 
left, bears a culumalda tree beneath a star. To its right, the 
next figure bears a broad shield symbol, encased by a moon. 
Following this is the figure with a half sun beneath a horizontal 
sun, in the centre of its chest. The symbol on the fourth is the 
opposing symbo, a half son above a horizontal blade. The fifth 
figure posesses a symbol of a a blade beneath a curving bridge. 
Final in line, the sixth has only a single vertical rectangle of 
white glass.

A Grand Events Hall~
   Plush carpet lines the entirety of this great events hall. 
With numerous tables of all shapes and sizes set in tasteful 
patterns, this area is fit to hold large numbers of people at a 
single time. As with the rest of the building, massive white 
stones have been shaped and set into place, giving a pristine 
appearance. Set permanently into a clustered semi-circle at the 
far end of the hall are six stone seats, each etched with its own 
symbol. 
   Near the centre of the hall, heading north is a small oak 
door. To the south is one carved of lebethron.

   Though considerably smaller than the rest of the structure, 
this small sitting room has been made much more luxurious. Plush 
black rugs have been laid across most of its entirety, including 
near the rather large river-stone fireplace set into the eastern 
wall. The western wall has several pairs of semi-large shutters 
set into it, each opening to reveal movable panes of glass in the 
windows. 
   To the south, the single oak door leads back into the main 
portion of the Hall.

A Comfortable Sitting Room~
   Broad enough for comfortable seating of roughly a dozen or so, 
this seating room has been covered with rugs and drapings to make 
it rather more accomodating than the rest of the Hall. A fine 
stone fireplace is set into the southern wall, flanked on the 
east and western walls by large windows set with shutters. Into 
the fireplace, etchings have been made of seven different 
symbols, none taking precedence or particular value over another. 
The ceiling is a gentle dome shape, arching upward for a few feet 
before beginning its descent. 
   To the north, a door carved of lebethron leads back into the 
Hall.

A Large, Statue-filled Courtyard~
   Guarded on its western flank by a massive steel-barred gate, 
the courtyard of the eastbound structure has been set in function 
rather than form. Though trees do line the pathway directly east 
to west, there are large statues spaced every so often down the 
center. Depicting a large, aggressive bird with quite a long 
neck, each one of the carvings holds inscriptions etched into the 
very rock beneath. White flagstones make up the surface of the 
outdoor area, and great blocks of stone create the high walls 
around it. Nestled in the north-west corner of the courtyard is 
a stable of medium size, hidden partially by extensive and well 
cared for plant life. 
   To the east, a pair of large oak doors are set into the entry 
way of a large stone building. To the west, bars of steel 
provide aegis over the courtyard.

A Large Oak Stable~
   Eight secondary support beams, and two primary supports have 
been carved out of fine oak logs. With enough space for eight 
horses, and the room for two to move side by side down the 
centre, the stable is of reasonable size. Sindarin characters 
have been carved into each support beam, below a single swan. 
The area at all times holds the smell of horses, and the faint 
odour of manure. Scattered in thick layers across each stall, 
golden straw is often found, with bales of it piled at the far 
end of the small area. Hooks and rings for tack and saddles are 
present inside of each stall, polished iron glimmering in 
torchlight. 
   There is a single exit to the courtyard, near the south end of 
the stables.

A Spartan Entry Hall~
   Barren of many adornments expected in a hall of such size, 
this great stone-walled entrance is graced with but a single long 
black carpet. Stretching from the doors of oak to the west, 
towards the wide stairs leading up into the rest of the Hall, the 
material is laid out between many pairs of white stone columns. 
Each individual pillar has been carefully shaped and carved to 
depict small images of the White Tree. Hanging to either side of 
the stairwell leading upwards, great banners of deep blue are 
touched with grand images a sinister swan facing to the left. 
The rest of the Hall is rather spartan. 
   To the west, a pair of doors carved from solid oak bar 
passage. Stairs at the opposite end of the hall lead up into the 
remainder of the building.

A Grand Meeting Hall~
   Of immense size and length, this grand hall stretches over one 
hundred paces from the stairs, to the other side of the area. 
With a width of roughly half that, it is capable of holding a 
very great many people, even if it is taken up mostly by tables. 
One long stone table, stretching almost the entirety of the hall, 
dominates the centre of the room. Within the confines of the 
table's surface, a pair of great swans are set in the middle of 
the table. Reversals of one another, so that each may face the 
left on whichever side of the table they are properly facing, 
their sinister features offer note to who the table belongs. 
Smaller tables are set up about the area, though they all avoid 
the great white pillars which line the hall. At the far end of 
the building, opposite the stairs, a great hearth has been set 
into the eastern wall. Within its vaulted ceilings, alcoves have 
been cut to allow air to pass, each one guarded from 
precipitation by the hoods of stone covering each. 
   To the north, a small oak door leads into a lounge area. To 
the south, a similar door leads to an office.

black rug that stretches from the door, to the opposing wall. No 
ornamentation is present in the office, the spartan appearance 
deliberate by its builders.

mid-sized hearth has been cut into the very rock of the wall. 
The floor holds the only embellishment, a sinister looking swan 
facing left when looked upon from the doorway.

A Courtyard Filled with Plant Life~
   Shaded by the boughs of large-limbed trees, this courtyard has 
been practically filled with plant life. A single path of white 
stone leads from the gates to the west, to the entry hall to the 
east. Wide enough for two horses to move abreast, it is 
surrounded on either side by dirt and grasses. Ivy clings to the 
surfaces about the area, mostly concentrated on the structure to 
the east. The walls of the couryard, easily half again taller 
than any man, or rider for that matter, have been cleared of all 
ivy. No trees are near to the walls, keeping them clear of any 
easy infiltration. 
   To the west; a large gate of steel rises up and blocks egress. 
To the east; great carved doors of oak bars entry to the great 
hall. A stable of average size rests in the north-west corner of 
the courtyard.

this structure has taken on a more wild appearance. Vines have 
weaved their way through the supports of the stable, almost 
blocking away some of the openings in the walls. Across the dirt 
floor, pieces of golden hay are strewn about. With fresh bales 
kept on wooden shelves in the far end of the area, there is 
little else to be considered neat and tidy.

A Grand Entry Hall~
   Stretching a hundred paces from the grand oaken doors to the 
west, to the hall-width stairs to the east, great care has been 
taken to disguise as much of the stone as possible. Each of the 
support columns has been squared off and panelled with fine oak, 
each carved carefully to resemble a different image of a woodland 
area. The stone floors have been covered by great leaf-green 
rugs, the fibers and threads sticking up like stalks of grass. 
Set deep into the north and south wall, alcoves bearing 
permanently fixed iron lamps are placed, a half dozen on each 
wall. When lit at night, they produce just enough light to give 
a soft glow to the area. 
   To the west, tall doors of carved oak lead out into the 
courtyard. The stairs to the east lead up into the rest of the 
structure.

A Banner-Filled Meeting Hall~
   The white stone of this grand hall has been covered in its 
entirety by oak panelling, save for the grand hearths at the far 
end of the area. Each wall is taken up by a great etching of a 
woodland scene, a unique take on the forests depicted on each 
one. Three long tables dominate the hall, set side by side. No 
seat is particularly different from the others. Hung over each 
of the great hearths, trophies of distant past and the present 
are displayed proudly. Hung from the ceilings over each of the 
long tables, banners displaying a sword set upon a seven pointed 
star move in the breeze from above. 
   To the north, a small door of birch leads into an office. A 
similar door is set in the southern wall, leading into a lounge 
area. The stairs at the western end of the hall lead down into 
the entry hall.

the very rock.

A Grassy Yard~
   This large yard is enclosed by a dingy grey stone wall, 
blocking outsiders seeing in, but still allowing the sun to shine 
onto the many different plants and flowers growing here. A few 
small trees sit nestled in a corner, providing shade during the 
day. A stone path winds its way through the grass towards the 
northern side of the yard, where it leads to a wooden building. 
A solid door leads back into the two-story building to the west 
while a iron gate leads south to the street.

Tiled Bathing Chamber~
   The floor of this room is tiled with alternating white and 
blue tiles and the walls are paneled wood, polished to a high 
shine. A large bath tub sits in the center of the room, steaming 
water inside it. A stone stove sits in the corner, a large pot 
of water heating upon it at all times. Several barrels further 
clutter the room, each holding clean water that can be used in 
the bath. The room is lit by several wall lamps. A door set in 
the western wall leads out into the hallway.

Small Servant Quarters~
   This common bunk room is sparse of furnishings and has a 
somewhat military feel to it due to the bunkbeds and spartan 
appearance of things. The walls are painted a fresh beige color, 
with a fireplace built in the eastern wall to illuminate and heat 
the quarters. On each side of the door are windows with 
curtains, that let in fresh air and light during the day. A door 
set in the southern wall leads out into the yard.

Continuing Along a Narrow Side Street~
   The side street here wends its way through the alabaster city 
of Minas Tirith. Traffic is sparse as there are no shops or 
peddlers found in the area, only a few citizens venturing this 
far down the road. Bordering the white cobblestones that line 
the street are buildings of varying sizes. To the north a dingy 
grey stone fence encloses a yard beside a two-story building, a 
sturdy iron gate marks a entrance inside.

A Dilapidated Backroom~
   This reasonably large backroom from the storefront boasts 
stained dark panels of pinewood lining the walls around a 
south-facing door that has clearly been repaired several times 
and a set of bare stone steps leading down from the northeastern 
corner of the room. A small fireplace offers some comfort but 
little else here does, especially the smell of damp and the low 
ceiling.

A Damp, Cold Basement~
   Set under the butcher shop, this storeroom is nothing more 
than a square room of bricks, carelessly plastered many decades 
ago. The floor is a series of smooth slabs of rock, with old 
bloodstains and detritus scattered about.

   Relatively sparse in luxuries compared to the other offices, 
this large storeroom is filled with the scent of foodstuffs. A 
provider of raw shipped goods for the Fellowships of Cooks, 
Bakers, Glassblowers and Potters, Herenyand can supply hops, 
sand, flour, clay, vegetables and fruit. Due to the mass of 
competition from villeins, Herenyand tends to trade directly with 
taverns and hostelers.

A Fallow Field with a Firepit in the Centre~
   The fields here lie right against the walls of the city which 
tower overhead, casting a shadow across the rolling hills when 
the end of the day draws near. In the middle of this field is 
set a massive and ancient ring of large round river rocks, 
charred on the inside and weathered all about. White wood ash 
and dark gray charcoal form a pile in the center of the circle 
and around it lie various stone benches and felled logs, all 
placed at a comfortable distance from the campfire. To the west, 
one may see the walls merge into the rough, white stone that 
makes up Mount Mindolluin and far to the north spans the Rammas 
Echor, the great and ancient wall that surrounds the Pelennor.

   With just enough room for a couple of people to stand abreast, 
this alleyway gets little light as the high walls of the building 
on each side stop all but the midday light shining upon it. To 
the east the faint murmur of passing citizens can be heard while 
to the west a grim building building takes up all room. The

Within An Old Warehouse~
   Large and wide and with a high ceiling, this warehouse could 
hold ample stock or any number of people. Stone walls make up 
the building itself with untreated wood pannels giving some 
decoration to the floor and walls, though many of them have been 
vandalised, some in the north-eastern most corner black and 
charred in places. Every half dozen strides a thick wooden 
upright has been placed, holding the floor above up on eight 
sturdy legs. Light is provided by several glass lamps hanging 
from the walls, some missing, casting the odd corner in darkness. 
In the far corner of the room a spiral staircase leads upwards to 
the room above.

An Old Musty Office~
   Built into a small annex from the main storage room outside, 
this office once served a purpose. Kept in little better state 
than the rest of the warehouse, it has the same decoration of 
rough floor and wall boards though these have little vandalism. 
Where the door lies on the eastern wall the wooden floor has been 
worn smooth by the tread of feet. The room is lit by a single 
lamp that hangs from the low ceiling.

A Dark Attic~
   High up in the roof of the warehouse, this attic provides just 
enough room for an average man to stand upright, though the spars 
that keep the ceiling above hang low. Running along the eastern 
edge of the building, the attic is narrow though still large 
enough to hold plenty of space. Musty and dark, light is given 
by the dim lamp that hangs from the roof and a loosely boarded 
window that gives a limited view of the street below.

Upon A Deep Narrow Ledge~
   The smooth stone floor of this ledge is made up from the 
building under it. Either side, the high buildings streets of 
Minas Tirith give solid protection from the elements. The gap 
between them is wide enough to give a couple of men space to walk 
side by side though its length easily runs deep enough to allow 
plenty of space. At the far side of the passage a smooth wall of 
strong stone rises, higher than most in the south or the borough. 
At its base an arched window has been set, the glass tinted a 
smokey grey.

A Dark, Forgotten Building~
   Built from the same heavy stone as the rest of the city, this 
building is old. Cobwebs hang like curtains at the rear of the 
room and a thin sheen of dust covers the cold, stone floor. At 
one side of the room an old wooden door once stood, though now 
its hinges have rusted solid and thick beams of lumber have been 
used to nail it shut. The room itself is small but with a high 
arched ceiling, to the south a small hinged window has been set 
midway up the wall, though the glass stained from age.

A Curtained Off Corner of the Gym~
   This corner of the gym has been curtained off allowing people 
to change in privacy. Two iron bars have been mounted in the 
walls here forming a continuous rectangle allowing a tall, dingy 
red curtain to be hung high enough so that it reaches well above 
the heads of even the tallest of people and falls all the way to 
the floor. The curtain is split in the middle so that it may be 
parted for entry and exit but still overlaps amply for privacy. 
The light grey stones which make up the floor of the gym offer a 
cold surface to the bare feet of changing gym goers.

A Crumbling Stone Antechamber~
   Entirely devoid of windows or any similar device, the walls of 
this room are cracked and aged, the grey-white of the stone 
seamed in many places by irregular black fissures, leaving the 
unplastered surfaces rough and uneven. While the floor itself, 
once a pattern of mosaic stones, now merely a grey expanse 
littered with the occasional glint of blue, green or yellow, is 
kept largely free of dust and debris, the corners of the room and 
the surface of the walls remain coated in a fine powder of grey 
dust, the residue of the years gone by without a mending hand. 
Reminiscent of days of majesty, the ceiling bears upon its face 
intricate carvings and features, of noble men, and fields of war. 
The depictions somehow convey a sense of loss, as if those 
portrayed bemoan their fall from greatness. Appropriately, the 
air here bears a musty, stale scent, as if hearkening from some 
lost place, and thick wooden beams make up the frames for the 
passages east, west, and north of here.

A Large Square Cooking Space~
   A large crack in the southern wall has been mortared in, 
marking the chamber like a darker scar on the grey skin that 
makes up the walls of this square chamber. An item evidently 
added onto the room rather than something that was planned into 
its inception, a sturdily built wooden shelf extends from the 
walls at around waist height to wind its way intermittently 
around the perimeter. A small, rounded hole can be spied on the 
far wall, letting in fresh air, and on bright days, a strong beam 
of light that sets the motes on fire, weaving patterns of nothing 
in the air. In addition, several other small shelves have been 
littered against the walls at various heights. In the far 
northern corner, there is golden mess of wood curls and chips, 
presumably from bundles of firewood that find themselves dumped 
in this chamber.

Lion's Head Chamber~
   Possibly a fountain at some earlier date, the most distinctive 
feature of this rectangular room is the bas relief of a lions 
head, carved in painstaking detail, on the far wall, with a semi 
circular basin, grey and green, protruding from the stone below 
its jaws. The great beast is depicted with flared mane, its open 
maw a deep, foreboding darkness in the stone of the wall. The 
entire right side of the face from the eye to the corner of the 
jaw has fallen off on some long ago day, leaving the beast one, 
almost frighteningly lifelike eye with which to glare upon the 
occupants of the room. Wooden bunks of a much later design have 
been added onto the crumbling walls, still firm despite the 
decay, on either side, and the room is littered with bits and 
pieces of furniture and the refuse of years uncounted, manifested 
by cracks along the walls, and a faint skittering can sometimes 
be heard from behind the lions head.

A Passage Deeper into the Stone~
   The ancient stone grows more worn as one ventures deeper into
this place. On the left, it has given way entirely on some
bygone day and has been replaced by more recent work of brick and
mortar, in which a wooden doorway has been set, and narrow beams
of bright light escape through the holes in the mortar on sunny
days. The passage itself is relatively wide, but rubble still
litters the faded floor in places, pressing upon the visitor that
this is a place not lived in, and perhaps, visited but briefly.
The air here bears a distinct chill, and an unrecognizable odor
tinges at ones senses. The short passage may be exited through
the open way to the south, towards a larger, square chamber, or
through the doors that line the walls in all other directions.

A Yard and the Remnants of a Gate~
   This small, open space speaks nothing if not of the power of 
ruin. To the east, a large stone structure rises several stories 
above the ground, though the upper levels seem to have collapsed 
entirely in mounds of stone and rubble. The passage into the 
structure is blocked by a sturdy wooden doorway, which itself has 
been set into a more recent work of brick and mortar, likely to 
replace older stone that has given way. The ground here is 
grassy in places, and otherwise littered by rocks and stones of 
various sizes, and the oddest shapes. Bits and pieces of 
carvings and statues lie ignored amid the refuse of centuries. 
To the west, the remnants of a gate of stone and iron can be 
barely made out from what is otherwise a tall, seemingly 
impregnable wall of rubble. A single iron spire, rusted now 
though in places still bearing the black paint of its better 
days, rises like a memory from the grave of days gone by. 
Against the southern wall, still secure, a stone encircled cellar 
has been capped by a sturdy, recently added, wooden trapdoor, and 
at the northern corner, a single window set high in the wall 
still retains a barrier of glass.

A Ruined Chamber~
   This chamber extends from south to north, and perhaps once 
served as a grand hallway leading to other areas of the building. 
However, the destruction is strongest here, likely because of the 
grand stairwell that can even now be spied peeking its head above 
the great mountain of rubble that has fallen atop it in the 
northern end of the chamber, preventing all egress into the 
higher levels of the ruined structure. The collapsed stone forms 
a diagonal cut across the chamber, starting from the northwest, 
encasing the stairwell, and ending somewhere along the middle of 
the eastern wall. Where they remain undisturbed by the long ago 
falling of the rubble, both walls on either side of the chamber 
bear a long, intricate carving in bas relief, both depicting a 
beast that can only be a dragon, with a figure's sword struck 
into its underbelly. The floor space that remains has been 
cleared of debris and dust, revealing aged and cracked marble 
tiling, and obvious efforts have been made to bring this space 
into the realm of the inhabitable. A window can be spied on the 
western wall, its twin on the east now long lost to the realm of 
collapsed stone and lost memories.

   Possibly a servants quarters in happier days, this chamber is 
small, though not so much that it becomes confining. The walls 
are unadorned, and the cobweb of cracks and fissures in its walls 
make only minimal appearances. There is a single, barred window, 
high on the eastern wall, to let in the sun and the air. A 
yellowish stain has seeped across the intersection of the eastern 
and southern walls, and a vague and unrecognizable scent pervades 
the air. The door to the west, and the lock prominently 
displayed upon it both suggest more recent construction.

A Narrow Alley Against the Second Circle Wall~
   Little light escapes the shadow of the towering Circle Wall, 
demarking the boundary between the First and the Second Circles 
of Minas Tirith. This small cul de sac might once have been wide 
enough to comfortably travel, but the collapsing of a large stone 
structure to the east has caused stone, wood, and debris to spill 
over into the alley, likely from the destruction of a gatehouse, 
whose barest structure can still be hinted at amidst the refuse. 
Broken crates, discarded bottles, and the general trash of a 
place long ignored has accumulated here, and some fairly 
unpleasant smells permeate the area.

An Ancient Wine Cellar~
   A steep flight of stone steps lead into the dank depths of 
this stone encased cellar. The underground space has largely 
escaped the destruction that fell upon rooms higher up in the 
building, and many of the surfaces here remain as smooth as when 
they were first laid. On either side of the stair, the walls 
bear a uniformity of holes at regular intervals, where the bolts 
held up the wooden shelves in which wine may be stored. These 
are evidenced by the few scant wooden structures, now rotted 
beyond all recognition, that still remain attached to the walls. 
However, four sets of manacles, new and well forged, gleam 
ominously in the dimness, brought to life by the power of 
whatever light source the beholder might be carrying. There is a 
grim air to the place, and the scent occasionally found above 
culminates here, bringing with a disquiet. Upon the opposite 
wall, the incomplete word N I M R O D - has been etched deeply 
into the stone, while the last two letters have been purposefully 
destroyed by someone in ages past. Beneath the blazon, a doorway 
once existed, but has now been sealed shut.

echoes off of the large wall to the west. A thin, darker

follow it to wherever it ends. Along the northeastern corner of

itself is gloomy in most parts, the lamps not giving much in the 
way of an extensive view of the narrow strip of road. Broken 
cobblestones pave the way eastward and westward, several large 
chunks of rock and other debris lining the streets. Unpleasant 
odors waft from the corners of the road and perhaps the building 
which looms before you, and the scurrying of small animals can 
easily be heard.

strewn the ground, amidst living and dead animals and garbage.

sign representing their function. The south is marked by a 
picture of shelves and the north with various crafting materials. 
The west door is marked by a cooked turkey and the east shows two 
people shaking hands. Undecorated, this hallway is lit by 
staggered brass lamps.

Crafter's Supply Room~
   Almost as large as the workshops, this supply room is 
carefully organized to separate the supplies of each trade. 
Wood, cloth, leather and dyes are all stored in the shelves along 
the east wall while ingots, small gems, stone and clay are kept 
in the shelves along the west. The shelves themselves are set 
perpendicular to the walls with a modest walk space between them.

   Rows of shelves are set perpendicular to the east and west 
walls. Held stored in these shelves are finished items that have 
been accepted as worth being put up for sale. The room is 
without windows and the only exit is the northern door. The only 
other decoration present are lamps set between each set of 
shelves.

Crafter's Dining Hall~
   With an academy atmosphere, tables and benches are set 
throughout the room precisely in line with each other and evenly 
spaced. Young men and women come and go, eating meals and having 
conversations throughout the room. The hall is well lit by 
hanging candelabra and mounted wall sconces that provide a warmer 
feeling than the rest of the complex. Near the west wall is a 
serving station.

   Food preparation stations are placed against the southern 
wall, directly opposite two massive ovens. Between stands three 
long tables running east to west occasionally occupied by young 
men or women putting together the final displays of their meals. 
While it is obvious that this kitchen is used to feed the young 
workers, it is equally obvious that practice is done here as 
well.

There are doors centered on the east and west wall with pictured

the north are a set of double doors with brass handles.

decorated better than any other. The center of the room is 
occupied by a large oak desk. The walls have been decorated with 
plaques representing each of the fellowships. Centered on the 
northern wall is a window made of stained glass. The brass 
lanterns, used to provide the rooms light, are etched with the 
seals of the fellowships. Placed in front of the desk is a thick 
red and brown rug.

   This small shop's walls are lined with shelves. A counter 
curves across the southern wall, behind which is a door which 
allows access into the private back area. To one side of the 
counter stands a locked, glass-topped display case, carefully 
lined with black velvet, upon which gold and jewels glow and 
glint in the uncertain light. The entire shop, whilst unadorned 
and plain, is striking in its cleanliness and order.

Inside A Decrepit, Collapsed Room.~
   Only a faint stink of the outside permeates this dark, dank 
room. While once this room may have been in good condition, it 
has since fallen into a state of disrepair. The roof is half 
collapsed in at one corner, the wooden floorboards are rotten and 
the wooden walls have mould on them at some places. All over the 
remaining floor there is a layer of filth and grime which 
multiple small bugs and rodents have made their home. There is a 
large crack in the southern wall, where some of the rotten timber 
has caved in.

at while being tended. There is an operating table in the 
northwest corner that stands behind a discreet white linen 
curtain to give the patient behind it privacy while being 
treated. A few shelves line the northwest corner as well as a

Fellowship Comfortable Sitting Room~
   This room has been designed for relaxation, and is spacious 
yet simple, with an elegant decor. The floor and walls have been 
fashioned from white marble much like the ones down the stairs. 
Light is provided by several lanterns that hang from the walls 
when the sun has set. A few bookshelves line the walls, while 
comfortable furnishings have been placed nearby for those that 
wish to sit and read, or just to relax. 
   The grand staircase that leads back down is in the southwest 
corner, while a large door leads to the north with another 
fancier door leading to the east.

Fellowship Meeting room~
   The floor and walls of this rather large meeting room have 
been fashioned from white marble, while the vaulted ceiling has 
been created from a bluish-gray marble. Obvious care has gone 
into this room's architecture to create a light and airy 
atmosphere. The windows are unique in that they are placed at 
the top of the high walls and are iron-barred to prevent entry. 
A chain has been attached to the wooden shutters so that they can 
be opened for light and air, or closed against colder drafts. 
Nearly every inch of the walls have been decorated by the fifteen 
banners of the Fellowships, their bright colors and symbols 
proudly displayed. This room is almost an exact duplicate from 
the office downstairs, except it is much larger and more 
spacious. It has one big table at the front of the room and 
several small meeting tables throughout. The door back out is to 
the south.

refreshments can be brought in and placed on it without too much 
disturbance of what goes on in here. The exit to this room is to

A Bedroom East of an Office~
   Plain, unpainted wood makes up the walls and floor of this 
humble bedroom though the wood is stained darker in some places 
from use than others. The room itself is of moderate size, 
appearing just large enough to accommodate two occupants. A 
single window is set in the northern wall, covered by a 
threadbare grey curtain and the door to the west leads back out 
into the hallway.

cast on the shelf-lined walls dancing. Unlike the rest of the 
building, it appears relatively untouched by age. A solid wooden 
door leads back into the office to the east.

A Massive, Precisely Carved Yard~
   At least thirty paces by thirty paces, the dimensions of this 
yard have been carefully dug and carved out into the side of the 
mountain. Sinking in four feet below the ground level of the 
tower to the south, the area has been carefully smoothed out for 
work. Sturdy wooden supports and cross-braces have been applied 
around the entire yard, a methodical and steady pattern that is 
reflected on the opposing sides. The walls of the yard are 
indeed made up of the untouched mountain side surrounding it, the 
yard set so deep as to provide high aegis. 
   To the south, the looming iron-shod oaken door stands, the 
shining rivets and bands a testament to their recent addition. 
To all other directions, the stoney side of the mountain prevents 
passage.

lies another door. A large window covers much of the northern 
wall, faded black threadbare curtains hanging around it.

it becomes purely houses. Few venture this far down the road 
,only a few citizens passing through. The white cobblestones 
continue here east and west along the street. A bell beside each 
door allows those passing to ring north or ring south to alert 
those within of the presence of someone outside.

free of cracks or weeds. One or two of the houses sport gaily 
painted window boxes and tubs, which spill a riot of pretty 
flowers across the stones in the summer-time.

cobblestones that line the street are buildings of varying sizes.

   The ceiling of this massive chamber arches high overhead. 
Artistically rendered marble supports rib upwards from the 
corners of the room's vaguely squared shape and loft overhead, 
crowning it in a vaulted geodesic economy. It appears that the 
ceiling is twice the height of the base. The floor has been 
constructed with white stones whose dimensions appear to be the 
arm's span of a grown man. Seamless white walls gently curve in 
toward their tops as they form the ceiling in one line. The door 
allowing ingress and egress is large and made of an old, rich 
wood, the top of which supports a large half moon of a 
multi-paned window which allows light to flow into the room.

A Fenced Pasture with a Paddock~
   This section of the farm has been set aside as a pasture, with 
a worn, weather beaten wooden fence enclosing this acre of grassy 
terrain of the Anorien countryside. A number of sheep can be 
seen bleating around in a fenced paddock during the day while at 
night they gather under a thatched wall-less shed, built around 
one of the few trees in the field. A path leads east into the 
adjacent fields, with the farm buildings visible distantly to the

A Spacious Barn~
   Made from the wood of strong birch most likely cut from the 
nearby Anorien forests this spacious barn has one window facing 
south, providing abundant light during daytime. A wide double 
door is able to welcome the largest of crates. While the door is 
tall it doesn't match the height of the thatch roof, supported by 
wide, angled beams.

A Small, Stone Walled Garden~
   This very small space is enclosed by a mid-height, grey stone 
wall. The stones appear weathered and have a lush growth of moss 
across their faces. The enclosure itself is just large enough 
for the rich, dark churnings of soil that have been worked into 
rows where vegetation could grow. An assortment of small 
flowering bushes have been spaced carefully up against the stone 
wall with the greatest exposure to sunlight. A door, with two 
windows on either side of it, leads back inside the structure.

A Small Antechamber~
   While not as grand as the main hall this small room boasts the 
same fine stonework if only on a smaller scale. Its walls arch 
into the primary building's wall, mimicking the same angles and 
proportions. The craftsmanship and fine materials accentuate the 
more dominant structure.

A Dimly Lit Chamber~
   This dimly lit chamber sounds as if it is built close to some 
source of running water. The bricks making up the walls and 
ceiling are crudely hewn though they do form monolithic effigies 
which preclude stain or mark. The passageway back to the main 
storeroom remains open.

A Comfortable Living Room~
   This living room is modest in size though large enough for an 
ample amount of people to gather in relative comfort. The floor 
is made of wooden planks sanded smooth though slightly worn from 
time, atop which rests a stark black rug. A sturdy door is set 
in the northen wall, leading back out to the street with a large 
window set beside it to allow light to filter in during the 
daytime. To the west, a smaller door leads into a private 
bedchamber while through an open archway to the east, a kitchen 
can be seen.

the front wall on either side of the door. The curtains over the 
window are a dark blue, and the walls a paler version of the same 
hue. On the floor is a green rug atop plain wood planks. Large 
enough to hold a good number of people, sparse furniture makes 
the room seem almost empty. To the east is an archway that leads 
into the kitchen, and to the west, and south, doors bar the way.

A Comfortable Living Room~
   The thick oak door mutes all noise from the quiet street 
outside, so that this square room has a pleasant sense of 
stillness. The walls are washed with sunny yellow paint, which 
reflect light either from the window looking onto the street or 
from the wall-lamps. A fireplace offers warmth during the winter 
months, and the floor is laid with lovingly polished pale wood 
boards. A curtained arch leads toward a compact kitchen to the 
east.

runs across the tops and bottoms of the walls. A single, 
curtained window allows fresh air and light to stream in through 
the day and a glass lamp set upon the wall allows for lighting in 
the evening. The room itself is comfortable in feel but not very 
large, only allowing for a few pieces of furniture.

   It is a big working area, with machinery loaded against the

sprouts the occasional weed, defiant against the heat. Resting 
close against the City's Walls it allows its vapors to drift 
slowly eastwards.

A Cluttered Sitting Room: ~
   Upon entering this modest sitting room, an overwhelming sense 
of clutter and cramped space overtakes you. The wood-plank 
floorboards nearest the entrance leading outside are visibly 
scuff-marked and discolored. A set of wooden stairs rise several 
paces from the front door and lead to the upper floor of this 
two-story home. The plaster-coated walls are painted a drab 
shade of beige and appear to have been recently redone. Spanning 
one wall is a double-sided stone fireplace with a small wooden 
door set off to one side. Nestled beneath the staircase is a set 
of overstuffed shelves.

A Cramped Kitchen: ~
   A clear sense of order pervades this cramped room with every 
object tightly bound in its space. Along the wall opposite the 
door, in a shallow nook, a narrow stove is tucked in beside a 
polished counter with a grouping of short cabinets hung above. 
Further into the room sit the large doors to a modest pantry; the 
floorboards in front of it appear more noticeably worn than the 
rest. The double-sided fireplace standing out from the near wall 
offers a clear view into the next room and lets sound drift 
freely between.

the hall stands out in contrast to the recently re-plastered wall 
opposite. The wood-plank floorboards appear age worn but clean 
with a small, undersized rug placed on the landing.

A Spacious, Beige-Painted Bedroom: ~
   A pair of large, arched windows with white-painted sills are 
the focal point of the wall opposite the door that leads out into 
the hallway. An exposed stone chimney built into one of the 
beige-painted walls emanates heat when the fireplace in the room 
below is being used which keeps the space warm during cold 
months. The wood-plank floorboards in this room appear to have 
been refinished and bear an even gloss where exposed. Despite 
the high ceiling and large windows, this ample-sized room appears 
to be at risk of being overtaken by a collection of organized 
clutter stored atop any flat surface available.

A Drafty Spare Room~
   Upon stepping into this room one would likely notice the six, 
large, arched windows paired up on each of three three external 
walls. Unlike those throughout the rest of the home, the windows 
are covered in a layer of grime and dirt that turns their panes 
nearly opaque, allowing only slim shafts of light to pass 
through. A large patch of water-stained plaster on the ceiling 
has begun to crack and fall away in small flakes to the 
floorboards below. The plaster walls are in a similar state as 
the ceiling but without any evidence of water damage.

The Interior of a Sturdy Shed~
   The interior of the shed gives enough room for a couple of 
people to work in comfortably, and is fashioned out of simple, 
unstained pine lumber. One side of the room is taken up by a 
long, sturdy workbench with a number of deep, wall-to-wall 
shelves built over the wide work space. Long hooks hang from the 
ceiling at the other side of the space, set up to store whole 
carcasses of larger wild game like deer, bear, and boar. Each 
length of work station inside is stained with blood. Though it 
looks like this area is cleaned frequently, there is a perpetual 
copper-tint to the boards along the long, narrow gutter trench 
that is carved into the center of the floor.

stone chests for tools and fuel minimize the fire hazard in this 
workshop. Glass shards glitter from the the floor joints as well 
as other nooks and crannies within the room.

cobbles pristine wind their way upwards in a series of switch

decreasing as the architecture gradually changes, the streets 
slowly narrow, the intimacy of the structures increasing in spite 
of the continued splendor revealed in their ancient 
craftsmanship.

The Entrance of the Crescent Plaza~
   White cobblestones have been layered across the entrance to 
the Crescent Plaza, stopping as they mate with a pattern of grey 
stones. The grey rocks have been laid in such a fashion that 
they form a great and smooth crescent shaped moon, with its apex 
facing the north east. Shoppers, wealthy and middle-class bustle 
over the pattern at all times of the day. Light is provided by 
the bronze streetlamps on the surrounding buildings. 
   To the north is the northwestern corner of the Crescent Plaza. 
To the south is the southwestern corner of the Crescent Plaza. 
To the east is the center of the Crescent Plaza. To the west the 
cobblestones join with Rath Celerdain.

   White cobblestones have been laid very carefully across the 
surface of this plaza. Newly cut from whatever quarry they have 
come from, they are bright and well cleaned. They have been 
patterened near perfectly across the expanse of the plaza, broken 
up by the occasional bench of white marble. Bronze street lamps 
line the north west corner of this portion of the Crescent Plaza, 
providing constant light during the dark of the evening. 
   To the east is the northeastern corner of the Plaza. To the 
north and west are sturdy doors, leading to unmarked buildings. 
To the south is the entrance to the Crescent Plaza.

   Newly refurbished, this section of the Crescent Plaza has been 
'floored' with a patterning of freshly quarried white 
cobblestones. Relatively smooth in shape, their surfaces are all 
canted at an angle to divert water somewhat away from the 
surrounding shops. Middle-class and wealthier shoppers move 
about the area, with the recent expansions providing enough room 
for an occasional wagon as well. Bronze street lamps line this 
corner of the Plaza, providing light at all hours of the day. 
   To the the east is an unmarked doors, locked and secure. To 
the west is the northwestern corner of the Crescent Plaza. To 
the south is the proverbial center of the Plaza. Northwards, 
bottles and dried herbs can be seen through a small window.

this that a large number of shoppers, both wealthy and middle 
class move about, the occasional wagon accompanying some of them 
due to the recent expansion. Bronze street lamps lining the 
buildings on this corner of the Plaza provide light in the 
evening hours. 
   To the north is the entrance to the Crescent Plaza. To the

black rug bearing the image of the White Tree has been laid out 
upon the floor. The panels of the floor are made up of fine oak 
planks sanded smooth. Sturdy doors rest at the center of the 
walls, each one smooth white brick. Although it bares no 
windows, a number of sturdy iron lanterns hang from the walls 
casting a dim light. A few pieces of comfortable furniture have 
been arrayed in this room for entertaining. 
   An ornately carved door leads north into a small weapons shop. 
Similarly carved, the door heading westward leads into a Sage's 
supply shop. A small stairwell leads upwards, a door blocking 
passage to the upper floor of the building. Heading through the 
southern doorway leads out into the Crescent Plaza.

A Sweltering Forge Yard~
   Moderately sized, this work yard has been carefully 
constructed to house the forgeworks it currently holds. The 
'courtyard' styled area has flagstones of smooth grey stone set 
down in the dirt, giving the area a relatively level, sturdy. 
Approximately fifteen paces by ten paces, it is lit by four iron 
lamps, one in each corner of the area. This lighting is rarely 
needed however, considering the forge in the center. 
   To the south, a sturdy oak door leads into the shop proper. A 
well-built trap door leads down into the stockroom of the shop.

noticeable or special, merely a room for storage. Holding a 
bland and austere appearance, it bears little in the way of

a small pedestal keeping due account of goods coming in and good 
going out. It makes for a cozy, albeit small storage area. 
   A stout oak ladder leads up into the forge yard.

tools. White stone walls sit uninterrupted, aside from a quaint

fireplace. A thick black rug bearing the image of the White Tree 
sits before the desk upon the smooth wooden floor.

The Honeyed Hand Apothecary~
   Slender planks of wood fashion the thick, even flooring which 
stretches between four walls and is wrought out of oak, pine, 
cedar and the pale timbers of elm and willow. Similar planks of 
mismatched wood have been expertly mounted across two walls to 
either side of the shopfront, fashioning a variety of shelves to 
display a myriad of wares. The walls themselves are built of 
wooden planks, their origin in nature not easily defined as each 
have been thickly coated in a warm, creamy-white hue. The wall 
opposite the entrance door is bare of shelves and instead 
possesses a slender yellow-painted door on the right and a 
counter that stretches before it. The entrance door itself is 
painted a rich, lapis-blue and is set between two slim, 
shutter-adorned windows that look out over the street.

   Thick slats of willow, elm and oak fashion the floorboards, 
pieced together with delicate seams. The walls are equally 
wrought of timber planks, their origin harder to decipher due to 
the rich, sunny-yellow color of the paint evenly covering them. 
A single window adorns the wall, slender and tall, bearing wooden 
shutters and a view of a small garden beyond it. A 
yellow-painted door leads into the shopfront while to the right 
of it, upon the neighboring wall is a set of pale-green doors 
that lead into a workshop. Another yellow-painted door sits 
opposite the other, instead leading into the rest of the house.

stocking and storage space. A work table is secured to one wall 
for preparation. Rising along the wall of the sitting room is a 
sturdy, wooden staircase. A yellow-painted door leads into a

Fen Hollin~
   The wall of the Sixth Tier rises high above here, only the 
mountain itself appears over its edge. The barrier of the white 
wall is pierced by a door, ornate in design. Seeming to have 
weathered many ages it is none the less beautiful for its 
artistic detail. The pattern draws the looker's eye to its 
center where a large key hole can be espied. The road ends at 
this sealed portal and the area around it is widened, allowing 
for the gathering of a large number of people.

The Sumptuous Ornament~
   Elegant simplicity seems to be the proper term for this 
shopfront. The furnishings are unassuming but of fine quality 
with an eye towards comfort. The floor has been formed from 
slats of different kinds of wood artfully pieced into patterns 
and forming star-like patterns of dark rich brown and pale golden 
wood. Tapestries chosen for their warm coloring have been hung 
upon the walls and the display cases along with the chairs 
precisely placed near the wall are of a rich, dark-brown stain 
and delicately carved. The glass on the cases has been cleaned 
to spotlessness to provide an uninterrupted view to the fineries 
set within. Upon one of the cases near the front stands a bell. 
The outer door matches the floor, thick and solid and faced in a 
two-toned wood design. 
   A solid oak door set into the western wall leads into the 
shop's back area. The door to the east heads back out into the 
Crescent Plaza.

pale golden wood. The walls have been painted a pale blue hue, 
delicate and subtle. A single tapestry claims the wall: an 
outdoor scene with deep blue skies, golden woods and varying 
brilliant colors. In one corner, a set of stairs climbs, the 
risers themselves of golden wood and the banister painted a pure 
white. 
   To the north, an ornately-carved door leads into the workshop.

A Forest Green Bedroom~
   Rich and enveloping the dark forest green color that the 
wooden walls have been painted embraces rather than smothers. 
Countered by the golden-stained wooden floors, softened by a pale 
sea green rug and with not one. Two windows to bring light into 
the room, the sills the same golden wood as the floors, the dark 
green has no chance to become excessive. The room itself is 
fairly small, but of cozy rather than cramped nature. The 
furniture inside is simple and kept neat. 
   A small doorway in the corner of the room leads down a set of 
stairs into a sitting room.

beams from which oil lanterns have been set keep this region lit 
even when daylight is absent. The windows are set high in the 
walls but are wide, permitting streaming beams of sunlight most 
of the day and skylights have even been placed in two locations 
ensuring this workshop sees the best of light at all times. A 
similarly stained and glass-paned door leads outside to a small 
walled-in forge area. 
   To the west, the glass-paned door leads out to the forge. A 
door set in the southern wall leads into a sitting room.

A Small Walled-In Forge~
   A thick river-rock patio is made from the same multi-colored 
stones as the wall surrounding the small yard. Covered with a 
slanted and shingled roof, the forge which takes up most of the 
space is hidden from the worst of the elements. A tall chimney 
of bricks filters the smoke up and out of the small yard, set up 
against the walls that surround this garden from the rest of the 
city. The outskirts not encased in stone have been cultivated 
with green grass, blossoming bushes and seasonal flowers, 
well-tended and bringing a domestic touch to the workspace. 
   A stained glass door leads east into the workshop.

Rook takes Pawnshop~
   Rather than having lines of shelves on the aged walls, past 
their prime, this shop has numerous scattered crates and barrels 
across the floor. They are grouped in twos and threes upon which 
the most diverse wares are displayed, from useless trinkets, to 
musical instruments. That, coupled with dim lightning, offers a 
couple of unobtrusive places in the room. An old counter is set 
in middle of the room, unconnected to any of the walls. 
   There is a door set in the wall opposite from the shop 
entrance which leads further inside the establishment.

An Exquisitely Furnished Events Hall~
   Well over one hundred paces long, this ornate hall has been 
crafted using a blending of many hands. Stone floors of solid, 
white-marble, tiles have been set into the foundation seamlessly. 
Across the center of the floor is the only place where the white 
has been broken. Polished black tiles have been formed into a 
grand ring, approximately twenty paces across. Spaced rather 
carefully are the symbols of every single Fellowship in the 
Kingdom of Gondor. A sword. Shield. Hammer, candle, leaf. The 
list goes on. The ring is completed perfectly, and at its center 
the White Tree has been done flawlessly, with seven glimmering 
stars of crystal set about its boughs. 
   The walls have been panelled in oak and cherry, the patterning 
done rather smoothly across the entirety of the walls. Banners 
representing the Fellowships at large hang from their heights, 
draped down between great iron sconces. From the ceiling, 
several chandeliers of glass hang. Their crafting is by that of 
a Master's hand, the crystals of glass without a single flaw. 
Set into the walls of the room are giant river-stone fireplaces, 
the iron grates set across them to keep in the stacked wood 
required to heat such a grand hall. 
   A set of ornately carved oaken doors lead eastward, into the 
Offices of the Fellowship.

the tidy, shelf-lined walls. A large array of items ranging from 
glassware to stoneworking tools can be seen neatly decorating the 
shelves and a long 'L' shaped counter adorns the back-wall. In 
the center of this storefront is a massive grizzly bear pelt that 
has been cut into a square rug, the head still intact with the 
mouth open in a perminant snarl. A doorway stands erected along 
the back wall, closed off by the counter marked with a 
wolf's-head crest.

mortared making up the foundation. In each corner of this 
chamber, lanterns have been mounted to the wall to provide ample 
illumination. To the east a double-door blocks the passage back

connected by a large brass ring. The walls are lined with the 
same fir-lumber that adorns the storefront, shaped in half-moon 
crescents and pressed closely together. Three doorways mark the 
length, one on each side and a third at the far end, each adorned 
with a wolf's head crest. A long, dark crimson carpet extends 
the length of the hallway made of thick stained furs, and 
seamlessly connected.

   This greenhouse has obviously served its purpose for a steady 
stream of City Hortilculturists over the years. The pale paint 
peels somewhat from the wooden structure here and there, and the 
benching arranged along one side of the structure is old and 
quite stained in places. Even so, the glass is all unbroken, if 
a little murky at the corners in some places; and the soil 
filling the rich beds opposite the benching is rich and fertile.
