Base Room for Ruined Osgiliath~
   This is the base room for the ruined city of Osgiliath. 
   Original Room Allotments:' 
   Rooms 2100 - 2350 is the range of the city. Kept small 
because it burns down eventually. 
   The rest of the allotments are way outdated.

Before A Toppled Gatehouse~
   The road of Lond Caras-Mir approaches from the west, sloping 
upwards as it runs to the base of a pile of rubble and broken 
gates, the remnants of Osgiliath's western fortifications. The 
black and white cobblestones of the roadside have been marred and 
shattered. Two scorched towers, ruined and unstable, overlook 
the ramp, bordering it to the north and south. A tattered flag 
hangs from one of the towers, bearing the faded image of a Dome 
and twelve stars. Osgiliath's ruins can be sighted through a 
path in the rubble eastwards.

Beneath Worn Walls~
   A large section of the gatehouse has collapsed here, rendering 
the portcullis and main gate useless. Limestone walls that once 
marked the western border of the city of Osgiliath are now rubble 
and a wide gaping hole in the city's defences has been opened. A 
narrow path through the wreckage has been cleared and fallen 
braziers have been broken and smashed.

Crossing of Roads East of the City Gates~
   An enlarged square of black and white cobblestones has been 
placed here with roads joining from the north, south and east, an 
iron portcullis set in the city wall westwards. Farmers, lower 
class merchants and vagrants all mill about here, heading to and 
from the streets leading off. Dirt can be seen in places where 
paving stones are missing, and this is far from an uncommon 
occurrence. Four cast-iron lamp posts, rusted with old age but 
still able to bear light in the darkness, have been set in each 
of the four corners of this crossroads.

Rath Gil North of a Market~
   Rath Gil, the main street of the ancient city of Osgiliath, 
leads to the east and west here, passing by double story 
buildings of mediocre wooden construction. Twin rows of battered 
street lamps run parallel to the street as it cuts its way 
through the heart of the city, providing yellow lamp light in the 
darkness of night. A light flow of poorly dressed people move 
along Rath Gil, yet the occasional finely attired merchant can be 
seen moving among them.

North of The Coach and Hall Tavern~
   Following the route of Rath Gil here as it heads east and west 
are the common citizens of the western half of the city 
Osgiliath, passing by houses and buildings in poor condition. 
The street was at one point paved with black and white 
cobblestones, but now numerous potholes and a thick layer of dirt 
force a close inspection to reveal them at all. In the distance 
to the east a large, dome-shaped building can be seen, while 
immediately to the south a cedar-wood tavern borders the street.

West of a Large Intersection on Rath Gil~
   White-washed buildings line the street of Rath Gil as it heads 
from the city gates to the Star Dome that lays at the heart of 
the city of Osgiliath. Commoners mill about the area here, 
consisting mostly of farmers bringing in their products to sell 
in the markets as well as citizens of the sparsely populated 
city. Underfoot runs a packed dirt road, the occasional basalt 
or limestone flagstone cropping out from it. An intersection of 
two streets lies to the east, while a blacksmith store sits upon 
the northern edge of Rath Gil here. 

To the south lies a pile of charred timber and refuse.

Intersection of Rath Gil and Rath Earendil~
   Through this area two streets of Osgiliath meet in a slightly 
enlarged area. With routes leading to this small square from the 
north, east, south and west it sees a good flow of traffic, 
mostly ill-dressed citizens of the city but also a number of 
wagons and farmers. Cobblestones and hard-packed dirt vie for 
dominance throughout the square here, the flagstones long past 
any organised attempt at maintenance. The white walls of the city 
can be seen rising over the wooden buildings in all directions 
save to the east, where a large domed structure cut from stone 
can be seen.

Rath Gil Before the Dome of Stars~
   Rising up high above the rooftops of the slightly dilapidated 
housing of Osgiliath to the east is the Star Dome, once the 
palace of the Kings of Gondor, yet such times are no more. Built 
from square blocks of limestone, the weather has taken its toll 
upon the walls and dome of the building, with large holes into 
the stone visible from street level. The remnants of what may 
have once been a balcony out of the dome juts out from a hole in 
the side, and below it lies a set of tall doors made from oak. 
   A small, wooden store lies southwards, while an intersection 
of streets can be seen to the west.

Crushed Entry Hall of the Dome of Stars~
   Once a great entrance hall, now the stone walls of this foyer 
are warped and crushed by boulders and the weight of the collapse 
above, large pieces of the masonry laying broken all around. 
What might have once been fine tapestries and ancient banners of 
war now lay amidst boulders and fingers of iron and pillars 
stretching up to hold off the mass of rock above. The entry hall 
remains are large enough to house many still and perhaps three 
times the height of a man. 
   Splintered remains of a set of large doors of dark-grained 
maple wood lay discarded some distance from the archway that 
leads out of the entry hall to the west. A large tunnel least 
sharply upwards to the east.

Pillared Corridor Through the Dome of Stars~
   Pillars of fluted stonework raise up to support the high roof 
of this corridor. While they may have once been impressive
displays of skill and craftsmanship, now the columns show many 
signs of damage, large sections of the masonry smashed out from 
the structures. The floor has been designed with an intricate 
pattern of white, grey and black stones, yet, like the pillars,
bears the signs of neglect. Few people move through the area;
those who do are dressed in clothing that is mediocre in cut and
fabric, contrasting against the regal nature of the passageway. 
   Eastwards the corridor approaches a large bridge spanning 
a wide river, while to the west a spacious foyer to the building
can be seen.

Crouched Within Debris~
   Little more than a low chamber stretching before a huge gap to 
the east, this space under the groaning weight of the Great 
Dome's wreckage threatens to close at any moment. Held up by 
awkwardly balanced boulders, segments of roofing and pillars, 
this is no stable part of the ruins. 
   The roaring of the waters of the Anduin can be heard to the 
east, where more collapsed ruins break up a broad gashing view 
out across the river. 
   A gaping hole seems to have been dug out of the westernmost 
section of the rubble leading downwards.

The River Anduin Over Wreckage~
   Broken iron rails stick up out of the water, while the fast

lay broken beneath here. The west bank stretches some distance

massive broken stone remains, reflecting up from under the deep

Ruined Plaza Before a Gaping Hole~
   Great sections of limestone blocks have collapsed to the north 
and south of this rubble-strewn plaza. The River Anduin can be 
heard to the west, rushing past a large hole wide enough for 
three wagons to pass through, though they would swiftly disappear 
under the depths of the fast-flowing water. Huge piles of stone 
and twisted iron railings have shattered almost all of the black 
and white chequered flagstones underfoot. Among broken statues 
of kings and queens of Gondor, many pyres of burnt skeletal 
remains are scattered, with twisted charred equipment and barely 
recognisable Vanguard armor among them. The whole area smells 
worse than a charnal pit, the only relief granted by the winds 
flooding in from the western breach. 
   Many huge boulders lay amongst the ruins, evidence of the 
earlier siege of the city and the havoc caused. Overhead great 
holes in the high ceilings let in the elements, only some of the 
marble pillars supports still standing. High above some remnants 
of the ceiling and higher floors remain, held together 
precariously by leaning walls and rubble.

   Fluted stonework makes up the broad pillars that support the 
stone ceiling enclosing the corridor. A chequered pattern of 
black and white tiles runs underfoot, heading from east to west 
in the broad passageway large enough to allow the progression of 
a trade caravan. Dust and spider webs occupy the upper arches 
where the pillars meet the roof work, surprisingly intact though 
many are daubed in dark blood murals and painted figures. The 
entire corridor is undamaged except for at the eastern end where 
a huge boulder blocks further passage. Rubble and dust cover the 
area, as do burnt remains of what appears to have been an attempt 
to barricade this area at some time in the past.

Entry Hall to the Dome of Stars~
   Easily wide enough to allow a dozen soldiers abreast to march 
through without great hindrance, the days of such displays seem 
long gone in this entry hall to the Dome of Stars, the building 
that in ancient times served as the palace to the Kings of 
Gondor. Circular in shape, numerous small iron hooks ring around 
the room, perhaps once holding fine tapestries and adornments but 
now they carry no burden. 
   A long, straight-set corridor bordered by stone pillars leads 
off to the west, cutting through the heart of the Star Dome, 
whilst a pair of large oak doors, twice as tall as a man, rest in 
the eastern wall. A wide staircase set on the northern edge of 
the room leads up to another pair of smaller, yet equally stout 
doors.

An Ancient Street, Before the Ruined Dome of Stars~
   This broad, rubble-strewn street progresses no further to the 
west, where it meets with the sunken edge of a massive, limestone 
dome, the timber frame burnt and terribly splintered. A pair of 
massive oak doors, once hinged to the arching entryway of the 
dome, have been blasted from their former position, and now lay 
flat against a pile of loose stone rubble. High above, remnants 
of the old floors and roof remain, with many gaping holes and 
jutting wreckage. Eastward, the street stretches on, meeting 
another at a bleak intersection.

A Bleak Intersection of Roads~
   A wide square of demolished flagstone is created here, where 
bleak streets from the south, west and east intersect. The 
streets, once paved with an alternating pattern of cobbles, have 
lost their decoration, and are now uneven and marred. To the 
north buildings have collapsed to all but block travel in that 
direction, leaving mounds of rubble in their wake. The 
intersection clearly sees little traffic, the debris that divides 
it not cleared or shifted. A huge, collapsed dome built from 
hewn limestone lies destroyed to the west, a short distance along 
the road.

A Road of Black Basalt, Running East to West~
   This road of blackened basalt cobbles was once known as Rath 
Gil. Devoid of life and flanked by the ruin of abandoned 
buildings, the atmosphere is normally one of unsettling quiet. 
Many of the ruined houses lining the street to the north and 
south have been pulled down. Those fashioned of wood have been 
singed to soot and ash, their shutters shattered. 
   To the east, a series of trenches and palisades can been seen 
before the broken form of the stone wall and shattered iron gate 
which once held this street. A bridge of planks is here, able to 
be laid across the killing zones edge to the north up to an 
archers platform along the length of the wall to the east.

A Black Basalt Road, Cutting Through the Ruin~
   This road, once wide enough to acommodate the breadth of two 
wagons, has become a twisting path through piles of debris. The 
road is rarely travelled, the ruin undisturbed. To the north and 
south the road is flanked by structures of stone and plaster, 
their facades cracked and worn. Far to the west the broken bulk 
of a fallen Dome marks the end of the roadway, visible across the 
flat horizon of crumbling buildings. A rubble-choked alleyway is 
visible to the south.

Following a Road of Black Basalt~
   Square flagstones of cracked basalt and darkened limestone 
comprise the bulk of the street here, the road worn, littered 
with potholes, damage and debris. Bordering the roadside to the 
north and south, past lines of rusting, twisted lampposts, are 
twin rows of abandoned residences, the old Gondorian architecture 
ancient and quickly fading with erosion. Those few buildings of 
wood are splintered and charred, some rotting in scattered piles 
along the roadway. The bleak street stretches west and east.

Dismal Intersection Before a Shattered Portcullis~
   A pair of bleak roads meet here before an eastward facing 
wall, the street cutting north and south blocked by fallen 
debris. The junction is shadowed by the height of the wall, the 
crenellations of the parapets clearly terriblly damaged. The 
lampposts that border the square have been shattered and rusted, 
as has a meshed frame of a portcullis laying to one side of the 
entrance into a tunnel through the wall. A trail of debris lays 
upon the ground, not impeding movement.

A Black Tunnel Through the Wall~
   This limestone tunnel shows the signs of recent damage. The 
tunnel cuts a passageway through a stone wall. On the northern 
and southern walls a series of torch sconces are freshly painted 
and set at precise intervals along the length of the tunnel. 
Dark-stained, iron-braced double doors sit firmly between 
newly-varnished oak frames, bearing black heavy iron hinges into 
the northern wall 
   Remains of a portcullis lays scattered about the tunnel. 
Scrapes and marks litter the walls, the signs of battle evident 
everywhere. To the east a newly constructed gate has been 
erected upon repaired hinges.

   The bank of the river here is mostly barren with only the 
occasional bush or shrub brightening it up. The water of the 
river laps over pebbles and rocks immediately by the waters edge 
and as the bank leaves the water it slopes upward quite quickly. 
Few animals can be heard and even fewer can be seen, travellers

Rath Earnil North of an Intersection~
   Winding north and south alongside the limestone city wall that 
lies to the west, Rath Earnil takes its name after one of the 
many ancient Kings of Gondor, that line now passed and the 
Stewards ruling in their place. This section of the city of 
Osgiliath has fallen into a rather derelict state, with many of 
the buildings bordering the eastern side of the street in near 
ruin, or nothing more then an ancient heap of rock, some so old 
that vines have begun to snake through the rubble. A guard tower 
lies to the west, while progress south leads to a crossing of 
streets.

Rath Earnil Leads North and South by the City Wall~
   The gloom of dusk comes early to the street of Rath Earnil, 
brought upon by the twenty-foot high white stone wall that rises 
up from the packed dirt of the road to the west. The occasional 
odd cobblestone, varying in make from limestone to basalt, pokes 
out underfoot in the street, for the most part hard, brown dirt 
leading the way north and south. Bordering the street on the 
east is a row of ramshackle buildings built from scrap wood, 
climbing upward from age-old stone remains scattered around 
before them.

A Turn East to South on Rath Earnil~
   The normal straight progression of Rath Earnil is forced to 
shift here as the Osgiliath city wall turns from the east to the 
south here. Set in perpetual twilight during the day due to the 
passage of the wall, and near pitch blackness at night, the 
street here is not made of cobblestones, instead composed of 
hard-packed dirt that quickly turns to mud in wet weather. Few 
people move by here, those that do raggedly clothed and attired.

   A corner is created in the walls of Osgiliath as the northern 
and western walls meet, indenting slightly before continuing 
their straight set path marking the perimeter of the city. Rath 
Earnil leads by at the base of the battlements, following the 
path dictated by them. Ramshackle shanties built from scavenged 
material border the packed dirt street, the occasional old ruin 
of stone nestled between the closely packed residences. 
Northwards Rath Earnil ends, becoming Rath Cemendur as the dirt 
road leads east to west by the wall.

as it meets with another street at a corner in the city walls of

houses in poor condition, many looking to be scant inches away 
from collapsing. Large, squared blocks of limestone sit heavily 
to the north and west of Rath Cemendur, a constant patrol of 
guardsmen moving past along them. Down on the street few people 
can be seen moving by, those that do dressed in little more then 
rags.

North of a Rundown Shop on Rath Cemendur~
   Rath Cemendur, like many streets in the semi-deserted city of 
Osgiliath, is named after one of the ancient Gonodorian kings, 
that line now sadly passed from the face of Arda. Despite its 
royal name, the buildings that lie on the southern edge of packed 
earth road are in ruinous conditions, many of the makeshift 
wooden and daub-and-wattle structures built up from a carpet of 
limestone rubble. Opposite them is the towering city wall, 
though it to is in far from a pristine condition. A small shop, 
a battered wooden sign without any markings hanging above it, 
lies to the south.

   From east to west the street of Rath Cemendur runs here, no 
cobblestones marking its way, instead dirt packed by the tread of 
feet guiding the course of the road as it runs parallel to the 
city wall that borders to the north. Only the occasional vagrant 
or lower class citizen of the west side of Osgiliath travels down 
this way, all intent on their own business and keeping a distance 
from the irregular patrol of guardsmen passing through. Climbing 
up from the ruins of age-old buildings to the south, much like a 
growth of mushrooms, are the dinghy shanties and shacks that 
house many of the population of Osgiliath.

number of cast iron street lamps, long ago succumbed to rust,

Dirt Path to the East of a Junction~
   Large, derelict double-story buildings loom up meanceingly 
over this thin dirt path as it leads east and west. Perhaps once 
bustling warehouses full of goods and laborers, now they stand 
abandoned, their dark wooden walls contrasting bleakly against 
the limestone city wall that rises up to the north behind them. 
A still silence holds over this area here, the only sounds being 
the pattering footsteps of the lone wanderer through this area 
played upon a backdrop of the noises of the near deserted city of 
Osgiliath. A junction lies to the west, while to the east white 
stoned rubble accumulates up to a large mound.

   Cropping out of the dirt road of Rath Earendil are the 
fragments and remains of the black and white cobblestones once 
used to pave the road. Now encrusted by the dust of the earth, 
they are unheeded by the slight trickle of people that walk from 
north to south, following the progression of the street. On 
either side of Rath Earendil an odd assortment of buildings scale 
up, constructed from daub-and-wattle and wooden timbers, to 
misfitting and scavenged stone. More often then not, they seem 
abandoned, with collapsed roofs and rotting wood.

North and South on Rath Earendil~
   Through day and night, a light movement of human traffic walks 
upon the street of Rath Earendil as it leads north and south 
through West Osgiliath. Named so after a king of Gondor of days 
long gone past, there is little of the splendour traditionally 
associated with royalty upon the street, the packed dirt of the 
road often rising up dust to light coat the clothing of 
passer-by's and in wet weather quickly turning to mud. The 
shanty-like buildings that house the populace of this section of 
the city line the street to the west and a recently replaced, 
pale cedar fence borders the road to the east.

Through the Slums of Osgiliath on Rath Earendil~
   The gentle sounds of the city of Osgiliath float lazily past 
one's ears here, the quiet steps of passerbys upon the dirt road, 
the distant striking of metal, a faint rumbling progress of a 
wagon and other slight noises. Buildings in slum conditions are 
set either side of the unpaved street of Rath Earendil as it 
leads north and south, little noise emerging from those either. 
The white city walls can be seen afar to the north, and the 
curved top of the Dome of Stars is barely visible above the 
rooftops to the east. 
   An intersection of this street and a slightly broader road 
lies to the south, and a ramshackle shop stands just to the east.

Rath Earendil South of a Meeting of Streets~
   Black and white cobblestones have been laid down on the road 
of Rath Earendil as it leads north and south through the west 
side of the city of Osgiliath. Brown dirt potholes are common 
throughout the street, as is a layer of hard packed dirt over the 
cobblestones in some places. A row of tall lampposts run 
parallel to Rath Earendil's progression here, and though many of 
them are damaged and rusted, some are still capable of shining 
out to provide light to the sparse citizens of the city during 
the hours of night.

Between Decrepit Buildings Alongside Rath Earendil~
   Following the irregular paved street as it cuts a path north 
and south through the city are a number of roughly attired and 
ill kept commoners native to Osgiliath. The occasional wagon 
drawn by horse or donkey rattles over the cobblestones of Rath 
Earendil, taking goods to and from the docks of the city that lay 
to the south-east. Buildings of wildly varying quality, from 
scrap shanties to daub and wattle cottages to ancient wooden 
townhouses look down at the light traffic that treks on below 
them, viewed past the row of lamp posts that burn brightly at 
night. To the west a sign hangs out from a shopfront, a hammer 
and chisel painted upon it.

Rath Earendil Meets a Junction to the South~
   A quiet hush has settled into place in the street of Rath 
Earendil, as well as much of the western half of the city of 
Osgiliath. The patter of boots and rumble of wagons on the 
sparse cobblestones of the road, quiet conversations of people 
about their business and the occasional shout of a child is all 
the noise encountered through this quiet section of what was once 
the royal capital of Gondor. Towering above the dilapidated 
houses at the end of the street a distance to the north and 
nearby to the south are the city walls of Osgiliath, constructed 
from large blocks of limestone cut to size and placed atop one 
another with remarkable engineering. A doorway leading into a 
shop lies to the east and southwards Rath Earendil leads into 
another street.

Approaching an Intersection to the North on Rath Earnil~
   Rath Earnil leads to the south from here, following the 
limestone walls of the city as they to dictate a straight path in 
the southwards direction. A rough city square lies to the east 
and north, white and black cobblestones laid down over the area 
as it bears the feet and wheels of farmers and their carts 
entering the city of Osgiliath to trade in the market stalls set 
up throughout the area. The street here however quickly sheds 
its cobbles for packed dirt as it continues to the south. To the 
west a narrow stone staircase leads up to a tower jutting out 
from the city walls.

Rath Earnil Between the Battlements and Market~
   Large blocks of grainy white limestone squared off to near 
perfection are placed atop of each other to form a towering wall 
that lies to the west, more than twice the height of the tallest 
man. Though still mighty in terms of height and width, faint 
cracks and other minor damage to the wall is visible from the 
dirt street of Rath Earnil that runs at the base of it as it 
heads north and south. Few people pass along the road, those 
that do almost to a man dressed in poor quality clothing, yet a 
short distance to the east a crowded market can be seen, the 
shouts and sounds of commerce echoing off the stone wall.

Rath Earnil Turns North and East With the Wall~
   Poorly dressed and ill-kept citizens of the western side of 
Osgiliath funnel through the narrow dirt road of Rath Earnil, 
squeezed between the stalwart city walls that lie to the west and 
south as they turn here and the collection of amateurly made 
dwellings opposite the limestone structure. An oppressive 
silence lingers here, heavy with the history of the once mighty 
capital of the nation of Gondor, broken by the occasional burst 
of sound somewhere from the farmer markets of the city that lay 
to the north.

Rath Earnil Merges With Rath Anardil~
   As the western and southern sections of the city wall meet 
here, so do the streets of Rath Earnil and Rath Anardil. Both 
are littered with the fragmented remains of black and white 
cobblestones, and they lead to the south and to the west in a 
near perpetual gloom during the day, the shadow cast over them 
project by the towering stone blocks of the city wall. A light 
scattering of garbage and refuse left by even the most ardent of 
scavengers litters the path as it nears the wall, the sign of 
poverty mirrored by the shanties and shacks that border the two 
streets to the north and south. Rath Earnil leads off here west, 
and Rath Anardil south.

Western End of Rath Anardil~
   Rath Anardil, so named in honour of one of the many past kings 
of Gondor, is nothing more then a road of dirt and sometimes mud 
that runs at the base of the southern city wall of Osgiliath. It 
narrows slightly as it heads to the west here before turning off 
to the north where it merges with another street, the edges of 
the street pushed closer together by the row of dilapidated and 
decrepit buildings that scrabble up from the ground on the north 
side of the road. The occasional methodical plod of a patrolling 
guardsmen or slow step of a busy commoner are indications of the 
slight flow of human traffic through the area.

Rath Anardil Runs East and West~
   A very slight upwards climb can be observed here on street of 
Rath Anardil as it heads further eastwards, the reverse being 
true to those who progress to the west. The dirt trail that 
makes up the road is free of any debris or obstacle, more likely 
due to the few people that inhabit this section of the city of 
Osgiliath then any conscious effort on their behalf to keep it 
clean. Calm and quiet rule over this section of western 
Osgiliath, the occasional shout or voice breaking the silence, 
but otherwise the complacent atmosphere hangs heavy in the air.

Rath Anardil Alongside the City Wall~
   This stretch of Rath Anardil runs the east to west in a 
straight course, its road composed of a thick layer of dirt under 
which the occasional odd flagstone can be seen. On the northern 
edge of the road runs a row of double story houses constructed 
from timber of all sorts, pine, cedar and oak being the dominant 
styles. Some of the buildings have been built up from older 
stone structures that from the first half of the bottom floor, 
more often then not covered in vines and other noxious weeds. 
Opposite the houses is the southern wall of the city of 
Osgiliath, rising twenty feet high in the air and constructed 
from squared blocks of white, grainy limestone.

Junction of Rath Earendil and Rath Anardil~
   The two streets of Rath Earendil and Rath Anardil meet here, 
the former continuing at the base of the colossal city walls 
heading east and west while the latter branching out to cut 
through to the north past the decrepit buildings of the city of 
Osgiliath. Hard dirt, packed down by the constant trampling of 
feet, is the medium of the road here, yet a few remaining 
flagstones of basalt or limestone rock can be seen jutting out 
defiantly from the road. A faint murmur of voices and passer-bys 
rings through the area, the increased traffic and noise in the 
city due to the proximity of the docks at the end of Rath 
Earendil to the east.

By Whitewashed Buildings on Rath Anardil~
   On the northern side of the street of Rath Anardil numerous 
dilapidated and decrepit houses lie, providing shelter for 
citizens of the west side of Osgiliath. Many of the aging wooden 
townhouses have been coated with white wash, but a significant 
number bear ancient layers of flaking paint or simply showing 
plain wooden timbers. People walk from east to west here along 
the dirt road of Rath Anardil, weaving in and out of the numerous 
wagons that head up from the docks at the end of the street to 
the east. Opposite the row of shanties, shacks and under 
substandard dwellings is the south city wall, rising twenty feet 
into the air and towering above all below it.

River Anduin that flows some dozen feet below. Across the fast 
flowing water of the river the eastern side of the city of 
Osgiliath can be seen, and bridging the two halves to the 
northeast is the gigantic Star Dome and the mighty bridge that 
runs through it. A portcullis is set in the limestone wall to 
the south, allowing access to the south down to the docks of 
Osgiliath.

dispel the darkness to the corners of the low ceiling of the

portcullis' have been placed over the entrances and exits that 
lead out of this space, allowing access to either the inner city 
of Osgiliath or its southern docks.

Anduin as it flows from north to south. A stone fence ravaged by

providing some deterrence against the drop into the cold waters 
below. Eastwards a flattened path of dirt descends alongside the 
limestone wall down to the docks of the city. A pair of banners 
of the colors gold upon royal blue hang from iron posts set in 
two turrets jutting out from the limestone wall to the north.

Dirt Path Leading Down to the Docks~
   Leading with a moderate slope to the east and west at the base 
of the Southern Wall of the city of Osgiliath, the path is not so 
difficult that the frequent wagons that travel along it can't 
move at a fair speed. It is wide enough to just allow a wagon to 
squeeze past people walking on the packed dirt of the path. The 
remnants of an ancient stone fence run along the southern side of 
it, designed to stop utterly careless people from walking over 
the edge of the rocky outcrop of the city walls and into the 
waters of the swift river below.

The Osgiliath Docks Near the City Wall~
   Oak planks have been laid down over larger beams to form the 
wooden boardwalk of the Osgiliath Docks built at the base of the 
limestone city walls of the city itself. Held above the waters 
of the River Anduin that flows past to the south and east, 
activity is never far away on the docks, with barges and other 
river craft tying up and casting off, bringing goods to and from 
the city for trade along other cities located along the river. A 
dirt path leads down to the docks from the west, where it quickly 
climbs up a rocky formation. A pier lies to the south, and the 
boardwalk continues to the east.

piers. Barges, skiffs, dinghies and other river craft engage in 
the continuous activity of mooring up to and casting off from the 
docks here, sailors and porters loading and unloading goods and 
cargo at all hours of the day and night. The waters of the 
Anduin are visible between slight gaps in the planking and over 
the side-rails, and the south wall of Osgiliath rises a slight 
distance away to the northwest. 
   The boardwalk continues to the west and east.

traffic casts off and ties up to the various beams of its length, 
sailors and merchants clustering about the docks hauling and

ferry back and forth across its waters. To the north the tall 
city walls can be seen, the various warehouses and buildings of 
the docks cluttered around the base of that limestone structure.

below, out seeking whatever luck they can find in the way of 
fish. Small dinghies and other vessels occasionally pull up to 
moor on the pier before heading off down stream. Further 
westwards the western shore of the river can be seen, and the 
lands of Anorien beyond. In the opposite direction the docks 
stretch out a short distance, then the broad expanses of the 
Anduin.

leads out from the main platform of the Osgiliath docks. Moss 
grows abundantly at the base of the large beams of wood set on 
the north and south sides of the pier, and overhead birds soar 
looking out for the discards of the numerous fishermen here. A 
ways to the northwest the great walls of Osgiliath loom into the

Passageway Through the Dome of Stars Above the River Anduin~
   A cool draft, chill even in the warmest moments of summer, 
blows off from the surface of the River Anduin that flows a dozen 
feet below the base of this corridor that leads through the Dome 
of Stars. Once the palace to the Kings of Gondor, those time of 
glory and splendour have long faded, with the westward set stone 
columns that support the overhanging stone structure chipped in 
many places, spider webs growing abundantly in the upper corners. 
Few people walk through this passageway now, the occasional 
jiggling sound of an armoured guardsman breaking through the 
oppressive silences settled over the area. 
   To the north, the corridor ends at a white stone wall, whilst 
an archway to the west provides access to a desolate room.

now this dusty and oppressive chamber is nothing more than one of 
numerous sections allowing crawl space within the ruins. 
   The ceiling hangs lower than most men, stone blocks hanging as 
if by will alone, while some iron bars stick out here and there,

A Small Exposed Section of Dome Roof~
   All around is carnage and wreckage, as the fortress over the 
east bank of the Anduin lays destroyed. While below a hole in 
the middle of this precarious section of roof offers sure 
footing, all other directions lead to steep drops out of sight 
below. 
   Eastwards the top of a rim of Great Dome rooftop can be seen, 
perhaps thirty feet away. Westwards, many sections of expertly 
constructed pillar supports remain, some at precarious angles as 
they lay toppled against each other. As Anduin surges below and 
the entire Bel-iant bridge lays beneath the waters, these pillars 
stick out almost as if they were stepping stones stretching 
westwards across to the distant Great Dome on the western shore, 
far away.

Northern End of the Hallway~
   A row of lanterns rise up from the rail guard set along the 
western edge of this passageway as it leads one path through the 
Dome of Stars. Oil-garnered light is cast down onto the black 
and white stone pattern that makes up the floor, yet few people 
walk past to receive the benefits, those that do being mainly 
heavily armoured guardsmen on patrol. Dust and spider webs have 
claimed much of this area, snaking around the fluted stonework 
pillars heading north and south at the eastern edge of the 
corridor. No further progress can be made to the north along 
this route, the limestone wall of the Star Dome rising up, yet to 
the south the passageway continues, the Great Bridge of Osgiliath 
visible a small distance away.

Above the River Anduin on a Collapsing Corridor~
   Bordering the passageway to the west is a stone guardrail, 
dangerously bent downwards towards the river gaping below, where 
the remains of twisted iron lamposts descend out of sight under 
the Anduin. The eastern wall is mostly collapsed, an entire 
section gaping above the waters. Ahead a large building has been 
shorn away from this corridor, access barred by a collapsed roof 
overhead.

   As the corridor that leads through this section of the Dome of 
Stars ends to the south here, a set of double-doors is set 
between the fluted stonework pillars that run along the eastern 
edge of the passageway. Two banners have been set before the 
door, the flags each bearing the Tree of Gondor, the symbol of 
the Steward, in golden embroidery. The River Anduin flows by at 
the base of the corridor, some twenty feet below, moving through 
the Star Dome though a great series of arches carved with amazing 
ingenuity and set in the central northern and southern sections 
of the old palace.

Rath Ostoher is Skewered by Another Street to the South~
   Several large buildings line this street. However, even 
though they are large and rather fancy, they have entered a state 
of disrepair. The stones of the buildings in several places have 
been chipped and broken, and much of the paint on the walls has 
peeled off. The broad street is paved with black and white 
cobblestones, and although they may have been perfectly aligned 
at one time, they certainly aren't now. Many have become loose 
and broken, and several are missing. The building on the west 
side of the road appears to be a store. Rath Gil intersects this 
street a small distance to the south.

Upon the Patterned Cobblestones of Rath Ostoher~
   Black and white cobblestones pave this broad street, called 
Rath Ostoher. While they are arranged in a checkered fashion on 
most of the street, in some places they have been arranged to 
form different signs and symbols. Lampposts stand at small 
intervals to give light to the street during the nighttime. A 
few benches have also been set up in the street for people to sit 
and rest. This street looks like it may have looked very nice at 
one time, but now it is in need of some new paint and perhaps 
someone to repair the road. The smells of freshly baked bread 
and other food drifts lazily on the breeze, apparently coming 
from the bakery to the east.

Among The Ruins of Various Buildings~
   What at one time seems to have been a street is now a massive 
carpet of rubble. Buildings appear to have succumbed to some 
sort of force, be it time, weather or other, and lay strewn 
amongst others who have similarly shared their fate. To pick 
one's way through this carpet is hazardous to say the least, 
sharp corners and supports full of nails interspersed randomly. 
A few metal spines, lampposts whose upper body have managed to 
push through the debris, stand askew, their lamps nowhere to be 
found. 
   A fallen building, apparently unmovable, impedes passage 
south.

Ancient, Crumbling Buildings Border a Black Basalt Road~
   This uneven road is comprised of basalt cobbles, the stones, 
once grey and white in hue, fully blackened with grime and soot. 
Bordering the street to the east and west are two rows of 
decaying wooden townhouses, their stone foundations cracked, the 
paint faded and flaking away. The residences have since been 
abandoned, windows broken, and enclosures eerily empty. In the 
street's centre sits a large depression, a great boulder of worn 
stone occupying the hole, surrounded by chipped tiles and dust. 
The road carries on northward, where it joins with another at an 
intersection.

A Deserted Street, Running North to South~
   North and south, this street of blackened basalt cobblestone, 
once known as Rath Ostoher, cuts through deserted buildings and 
dilapidated structures. The roadway is devoid of life, the burnt 
husks of trees and soot-swept vegetation slowly dying on either 
side of the street. The lampposts here have fully rusted, most 
overturned, the glass broken. The street presses on, the 
flagstones uneven and difficult to traverse.

An Uneven Street, Surrounded by Rubble~
   Perhaps the most noticeable feature of this stretch of road is 
the heavy silence that has settled over the area, the dead quiet 
almost palpable. The black basalt cobblestones of the roadway 
have been shattered, fallen timbers crossing the otherwise clear 
pathway that it cuts to the north. To the east, a once-imposing 
circular stone building has collapsed on its own supports, fresh 
repairs revealing new stonework and a doorway amidst the ruins. 
Southward, the path is blocked by a pair of fallen columns, while 
to the west the road narrows into a tight alleyway, ending at an 
iron gate.

Perhaps the most noticeable of features along the path of Rath
Ostoher, and indeed the entire eastern section of Osgiliath, is
the dead quiet which rules over the area throughout most of the
day and night. Broken occasionally by the shouts of a child or
the haggling of a merchant, for the best part the respectful
noiselessness hangs heavy in the air. The limestone and basalt
cobblestones of the street run past the slightly run down
buildings, only a few, moderately dressed people gracing them
with their footsteps. To the east, two large windows provide a
view inside a Cookshop.

Street Running By Flattened Buildings~
   The building to the west seem literally flattened. Supports, 
roofs, walls all have collapsed inwards, the top of this mess of 
debris pitted and scarred with old, broken arrows, large rocks 
and soot-streaked logs. It spills into the street, rendering the 
street slimmer than it once was, the grey cobblestones beneath 
only visible at intervals, churned dirt and mud in their place. 
A smell of cold ash wafts through here, lending the area even 
more of a dismal, forgotten atmosphere. A wall, newly 
constructed, rises to the east, the foundations of an old wall 
crumbled at its base. A small wooden sign bearing a horse is 
splayed atop one of the ruined buildings. To the west, a new 
construction has risen up. It is rather squat, the roof fairly 
low, but the doors are wide and high.

Upon the Tower Battlements North of the Gates~
   This fortified tower makes up the first of Osgiliath's eastern 
defenses, facing towards the windswept plains of Northern 
Ithilien. Crenellations run about the borders of its stone 
structure, beyond them a view of the sparsely grassed lands 
available as they run up to the base of the tower from the north 
and east. Southwards one can espy on the trail of traffic into 
and out of the city, as well as another watch tower set a short 
distance away, and glancing to the west a view of the city is 
granted, the Dome of Stars rising up in the center of the 
venerable settlement. The battlements run southwards above the 
gate housing, and a stout door is set to the north.

A Rubble-Strewn Street~
   Lampposts, set at random intervals, run north and south here, 
rather large gaps in between each occupied with twisted, stricken 
heaps of metal which may at one time been copies of their 
still-standin brethren. The lanterns have all long expired, some 
with shattered panes and others with twisted bodies. Heading 
parallel to the lanterns is a large, confused jumble of rubble, 
only a few buildings peeking their grimy walls through. Those 
few buildings visible are mostly one-story, made of a 
greyish-brown stone, though the couple of two-story buildings who 
have survived hold wooden walls, the paint long chipped with only 
remnants remaining. A new wall is opposite these, its bright, 
hopeful, carefully laid stones a sharp and ruinous contrast to 
the western misery.

Debris-Filled Street Following A Wall~
   A new wall, grey stones laid with care, turns to the west 
here, the street following faithfully. Its grey cobblestones are 
strewn with logs and rocks of all shapes and sizes, ruined 
buildings to the west and south giving off odors of mold and 
ruin. At the corner a skeleton slumps, rusted armor holding 
several arrows, its helmet still in place. The cobblestones here 
seems splattered with a black and brown stain, the shade provided 
by the wall doing little to dispel the gloom of the area. A 
stone structure is wedged against the wall, collapsed gates 
giving access to a burned and destroyed area within.

After a quick look around, the only entrance to be seen is that of a sturdy, reinforced wooden door in the front, which is guarded by a large, armour clad soldiers wearing a black cloak with the white tree.  Above the door way is a sign, and for those that inquire the guard says much the same as the sign.  "No Entry!".

here, strewn about the turn, an obstacle. The sharp scent of 
cold ash permeates the air here, a large building to the west 
having been reduced to a pile of cinder and ash, charred supports 
rising up like hands clawing for life. An oppressive, eery 
silence hangs heavy in the air.

At a Sharp Turn Before Collapsed City Walls~
   The road here takes a sharp turn, following the original 
stones of the wall. Buildings have been turned into rubble here, 
mold and vermin clinging upon their carcasses. The occasional 
rat darts out from within a pile of debris, though the road 
itself seems surprisingly clear of it. The foundations of an old 
wall lay in a single pile in the corner, moss grown over their 
jumbled surface. 
   To the north a huge section of city wall has collapsed and 
been left exposed. Boulders and blocks are scattered ahead as 
the way leads directly to Ithilien.

A Silent, Narrow Street~
   This old street is littered with the remains of once-grand 
buildings, its narrow path made even narrower. Beneath the ruin 
are visible hexagonal shaped cobblestones, a dull black in color, 
their surfaces coated with all manner of dirt, dust and filth. 
The northern wall looms heavy, its newly furnished stones running 
east and west along the street. Shadows inhabit this street 
during most of the day, a heavy darkness at night. The air is 
heavy and silent, some of the rubble along the street seeming to 
have grown some sort of mold or moss.

another, older wall, the foundations visible through a cover of 
moss. To the west, the black cobblestones of this street make a 
turn to the south, following the damaged and destroyed buildings 
which litter its path. What seems to have at one time been a 
wall is strewn across the path here, the stones a cairn for all

been sealed off by large stones, mortared in place though the job 
is sloppy, as if done in a hurry.

   A wide set of stone steps rise up at the eastern edge of this 
street, leading up to a watch tower set upon the battlements of 
the walls of Osgiliath. Guardsmen are abound in noticeable 
numbers, visible walking along upon the limestone wall or 
patrolling either up and down Rath Romendacil. Few civilians can 
be seen, yet those that do walk along the road are clothed in 
finer dyes and cuts then one would expect to see on an average 
commoner. To the north, the street expands as it approaches an 
intersection before the gates of the city, whilst southward it 
narrows considerably. Westwards lies the remenants of a building,
now collapsed into random fragments of burnt timber.

A Wide, Rock-Strewn Path~
   This path seems oddly free of rubble, though the probable 
cause lie in great number upon the road. Large stones pit the 
ground and the ruins to the west, seeming to have dragged walls, 
roofs and cobblestones with them. A few odd houses have luckily 
been spared, though one's wall and door seem to be splashed with 
a brownish color, a rock sitting a few feet away. The path leads 
in a fairly straight manner northwards and southwards, 
complacently following the wall.

A Wide, Abandoned Path~
   Leading away from the narrow corner to the west, the path 
broadens to regular size and then even bigger, caused by the 
simply lack of buildings on its western side. Rubble, stones, 
timber, and other byproducts of destruction lay in a heap, 
creating almost a plaza. Some houses still seem to be standing, 
gateguards to the ruin. They are both two stories tall, and loom 
over the street, watching sternly below. The path continues to 
the north, following along the wall.

Narrow, Sharp Corner~
   This entire section of street seems to have been destroyed. 
The few buildings still standing are barely so, their roofs 
entirely collapsed, doors hanging ajar, windows destroyed and 
walls fallen in. The cobblestones of this street are nowhere to 
be found, leaving the ground, or what's visible of it through the 
massive amounts of rubble which turn this once fairly-wide turn 
into a narrow corner, a muddy, grimy trail. The newly built wall 
casts a shadow over this turn, the bright stones odd against the 
ruin surrounding them.

Debris-Littered Turn in the Street~
   The city wall seems to have collapsed here, covering the 
ground up to the newly laid stones of the wall. Dull grey 
cobblestones, grimy with dirt and age, are visible beneath the 
large, jagged stones. The houses on the side of the street seem 
to all have been destroyed, some blackened and others with large 
rocks in their midst, while a few seem to simply have collapsed. 
This area is silent, some of the stones littering the ground 
bearing a brownish-black coloring.

A Narrow, Debris-Filled Path~
   This narrow street forces one to literally clamber over 
debris, the path filled by the fallen stones of what seems to 
have been a tower upon the ancient walls. North lies abandoned 
houses, most of them long descended into ruin and collapse. The 
street is eerily silent, save for the occasional clatter of stone 
as vermin scamper through the rubble. The wall itself is 
obscured nearly to the halfway point by the stone debris, and to 
the north what seems to have been a building is now a single pit 
bearing an immense rock, a single wall still standing to give 
homage to the fallen residence. The path to the north is blocked 
by rubble, seeming a pile at least as tall as the house to its 
side.

A Corridor of Derelict Townhouses~
   This street is a corridor of ancient, derelict townhouses and 
the wall. The wall is an odd contrast to the townhouses, its 
newly laid stones bright compared to the grimy ruins that were 
once fashionable residences. Windows seem to have been 
shattered, and a few houses lay in complete ruins, having simply 
collapsed into mounds of rubble and soot. Most other buildings 
are damaged, though it seems as if one tan building has been 
relatively spared from the damage.

A Deserted Junction~
   This old street is now a mess of rubble and destroyed 
cobblestones. Blackened, destroyed buildings line the street, 
wooden timbers and stones lying on the road below in memory of 
damage done. A low wall has been brought down to the south, 
turned into rubble, the rusted gate hanging lopsidedly from its 
remains. The street itself is littered with debris, beneath 
which a jumble of black, white and grey cobblestones pave the way 
in a haphazard manner, empty pits where stones once resided 
threatening to trip any who step in them. The ruined street 
continues to the east and west, a few rusted lampposts lending a 
desolate air, their shattered, twisted lanterns doing nothing to 
light the way.

An Abandoned Street Through Burnt Husks of Trees~
   The burnt husks of trees line the sides of this old street, 
their naked limbs clawing at the sky in a vain attempt to flee 
their doom. On both sides of the street lay ruins, derelict 
buildings with shattered windows and collapsed roofs. The street 
itself is of grey cobblestones, though they litter the ground 
only sparsely, seemingly shattered by the large amount of massive 
rocks pitting the ground here. An old lantern hangs, rusted, its 
panes broken, from a wooden post that seems to have escaped the 
damage, the only survivor among the destruction present. A small 
building stands to the north, windows shattered and the wall 
seems to have collapsed onto the street, creating a mound of 
rubble obscuring the interior. The gate to the south lays on its 
hinges, rusted to the point of uselessness.

   This plaza seems to have been the site of a fierce battle. 
Doors hang ajar from the buildings lining it. The stumps of 
trees and a few burnt husks give silent testimony to the 
viciousness employed. Ragged flags, torn to shreds, hang from 
the upper story windows of the northern building. It seems like 
that particular building was torched, its stones blackened. The 
cobblestones which make up the ground are a dirty, grimy grey, 
some of them holding a brownish hue. A building has completely 
collapsed to the south, the stones littering the plaza. To the 
west it seems like buildings have collapsed onto the street, 
rendering passage impossible.

Crenellated Tower Overlooking Northern Ithilien~
   Set in the eastern walls of Osgiliath, this watchtower 
provides a sweeping view of the barren, wind-blasted terrain of 
Northern Ithilien. Peasant villages and farming homesteads are 
visible in the distance, as well as a long road stretching out to 
a distant range of mountains visible upon the horizon. A solid 
iron pole rises up from the centre of the platform here, a large 
banner hoisted upon it. Displayed upon its dark blue linen in 
thick golden thread is the Tree of Gondor, seven stars placed 
about it.

Lush Parkland Beside a Shrouded Pool~
   Drooping willow trees let loose their slender branches over 
the soft grass of this parkland, the branches of several birches 
intertwining to form a natural canopy over a small, shallow pool 
set in the centre of this area. A small stone path, paved with 
irregular, grey stones leads up from the east to the beginning of 
the pool before ending at its cool waters. Past the flora to the 
north the limestone city wall can be seen, branching vines 
running up its surface and mold growing in the cracks between the 
large blocks. To the west a smaller wall rises up, also bounded 
by branches and vines.

Despite these restrictions, the trade still seems to progress in 
earnest, with hawkers, merchants, stall vendors and more offering 
wares for sale. There is a distinct rural atmosphere to the area 
here, acting little more then a path through the various sellers, 
with most of the products for sale being agricultural in nature, 
farm tools, grain, livestock, poultry, dairy products and more 
being the primary wares for sale.

through. Tents and stalls signal a few of the more permanent 
traders, many simply holding their goods for sale and advertising

hawkers and hucksters that have set up stalls and small tents 
here. A gala of colour, sights and smells is presented to those 
that stray in the thick of business, compounded with the cries of 
promotion that echo off against the paving stones. To the west a 
city street runs past the market, few if any people travelling 
across it, the near deserted facet of Osgiliath present only a 
few feet away from this area of concentrated activity. 
   A colorful display of glass bottles is arranged in the shop
window to the south.

   This large stable was originally constructed from dark grey 
stone. Now just the supports and bottom part of the structure 
remain. Some repairs are evident as the red brick clashes with 
the dark color of the stone. Six stalls reside along the walls, 
with a large open area between them. At the end of the stables 
is an area set up for storage of supplies and equipment. A 
ladder leads up to the hayloft above while a large door leads off 
to the west towards a subdued pathway.

display all sorts of second hand goods and scavenged junk, yet 
one or two items of any worth for purchase can be seen about the 
shop. A solid oak door held securely on by a pair of bronze 
hinges opens out to the street, set in the north wall. Another

in all shapes and sizes, fragments of wooden beams, pieces of

The Shining Knife~
   Small iron hooks have been driven into the stone walls of this 
spacious storefront, all bearing weapons of good quality, from 
swords and axes to spears and halberds. Other armaments of 
mediocre make have been placed in the various racks and shelves 
positioned on the thick green carpet that stretches from wall to 
wall. A maplewood counter runs the length of the northern wall, 
many smaller items such as whetstones and blade oil adorning the 
top of it. The clientele of this store is rather sparse, but the 
occasional customer, whether an off duty guardsman or finely 
dressed gentryman, can be seen browsing through the wares.

UNUSED Raldir's Wooden Wonders~
   Set from the centre of the roof is a fanciful iron candelabra, 
its long spirals each ending in a candle that casts light down 
onto the floorboards once the light of day recedes from the glass 
windows set in the eastern wall. The walls themselves are of 
dark wood, yet they stand out due to large carvings of mythical 
birds and beasts painstakingly etched into them. Legendary 
creatures look down from their capture in the wooden walls, 
attracting the appreciative gaze of the customers of this store. 
Objects fashioned from wood are set on numerous benches and 
counters, ready for purchase at the long maplewood counter set by 
the western wall.

Hearth and Home Bakery~
   The fresh smell of baked goods fills the entire store, varying 
from the simple, hearty aroma of baked bread to the delicious 
scents of spiced-cookies and fruit-filled pies. The floor and 
walls are of wood, well-made and tight against the elements. 
Baked goods are set on display inside glass-paned cases or on 
wooden countertops, with ever-present customers filtering in and 
purchasing goods at almost all hours. A wooden door set in the 
western wall provides an exit out of the store, while a sturdy 
door set in the eastern wall provides an entrance into the bakery 
itself.

   Hangings and embroideries festoon the white plaster walls of 
this expensive, dainty shop. Racks, shelves and even mannequins 
display fine clothing designed for wear and use by men, as well 
as other sewn goods of all sorts and shapes. Dominating the 
centre of the room is a large, oak counter, rather old yet its 
wood polished to a high sheen. Several large windows have been 
set beside the eastern doorway, allowing light to enter the area. 
As well as the natural sunlight provided by the windows, an 
ancient candelabra hangs from the ceiling in order to illuminate 
all areas of the room.

   Dresses, blouses, skirts and chemises of all shapes, sizes and 
styles can be seen throughout this room, some neatly folded upon 
racks, hanging on mannequins, and set out from the walls. The 
room itself is of a substantial size and a line of fitting rooms 
set at the western, blocked out by a thick, red curtain. A 
single, plain iron candelabra hangs from the ceiling, the blazing 
candles lighting the entire area, whilst a pair of glass windows 
set in the east wall look out onto the street. An archway set in 
the southern wall leads to the entrance of the store.

for a break where the wide gate offers access. From here a view 
of the ruined building and flame-damaged cobblestones stretches 
eastwards towards the walls of East Osgiliath. 
   East one can see over the remains of the wall to the streets 
beyond, down one can see the killing zone of trenches and 
palisades torn into what was once Rath Gil. Westward a wooden 
plank bridge, guarded by a palisade, leads past the defenses to 
the streets beyond.

Stone Passageway~
   Stone walls and floor lead in the directions of north and 
south, the white rock cut into regular blocks and without 
adornment. A slight trickle of people, dressed in both simple 
clothing and guardsmen uniform, make their way to and from the 
exits of this area, conversations carrying on throughout the 
hallway. Being slightly cool during the hours of night, light is 
provided from a pair of sconces set either side of a window cut 
in the western wall. A solid door has been fitted to the east 
wall, allowing entrance into a much noisier and warmer area.

Narrow Passageway West of Cooking Smells~
   This passageway comes to an abrupt halt to the south, ending 
at a solid, stone wall that offers no compromises. Northwards, 
an uncarpeted floor leads its way through the barracks of the 
Osgiliath guard garrison, a few members of the organisation 
making their patrols through the corridor. Vague sounds echo 
throughout the area, the jingle of armour combined with the 
general noises of a place inhabited by a large number of men. To 
the east the smells of cookery filter through an oak door.

Spacious Barracks~
   Despite the stone walls, floor and ceiling, this room is far 
from cold and remote, warmed by the constant presence of human 
bodies. Whether sleeping, waking, conversing softly or dressing 
for duty, these barracks are never truly still and empty, with 
watches of the Osgiliath Guard running both night and day. The 
sleeping quarters of the garrison is furnished only with perhaps 
a score of bunkbeds that run down the rectangular room in a trio 
of rows, all battered yet still serviceable. To the south a 
green curtain covers an arch while to the west a door leads out 
of the barracks.

a rough yet warm woollen blanket, and each bed is kept neat and 
orderely in a military fashion. These quarters are designated 
for unmarried members of the Osgiliath Guard, and a number of 
figures dozing and sleeping are present in these barracks at all 
times of the day. A green curtain covers a passage north, while 
a secure oak door facilitates movement to the west.

mouths of the Osgiliath guard garrison, and the oven is tended no 
matter what hour the clock reads by the cook or an assistant in 
the kitchen. The smell of roasting meat occasionally wafts 
through the air, and vegetables can be seen laid about the 
numerous benches that ring around the area. Only the occasional 
guardsmen wanders through this area, entering from either of the 
two small oak doors set in the northern and western walls of the 
room.

Large Messhall~
   Crowded yet congenial during the meal times of the day and 
evening, occupied with a light gathering of men and women at 
other times, this messhall is constantly filled with a warm and 
friendly atmosphere. The white walls of stone are not set too 
far apart, thus adding to the close-set nature of the room, and 
the floor space is primarily occupied by four rectangular tables, 
long, simple benches set either side of them. A small hearth set 
in the eastern wall of the room provides warmth during the colder 
months of the year, and three oak doors led off in the other 
directions, the two smaller to the south and west, while the 
large set of doors rests in the north wall.

Shattered Landing at the Top of a Stairwell~
   Massive damage to this area has resulted in the southern 
section collapsing, all that remains of a marble staircase a few 
slabs laying among the wreckage from above. A shredded old blue 
rug is trapped under the huge skeleton of a troll, one massive 
hand reaching out to the absent wall to the east forever cast in 
stone. An archway leads westwards and is relatively undamaged. 
   The hole to the east grants a view over the remains of East 
Osgiliath and even further over the walls to the dark mountains 
many leagues beyond. 
   At the eastern edge of this precarious platform, a view 
directly down to the exterior of the old entrance to these ruins 
can be seen.

on racks bear the aroma, blades of all sorts lay wrapped in oil
soaked rags as do the array of mail suits displayed along the 
rear wall. Spacious and well ordered, the armoury bears enough
arms and armour to outfit an army. Pike and halberds lay leaned
against tall racks that in turn bear axes and maces, everything 
kept in impeccable condition. A small, shielded lantern casts a 
slight light onto the room, whilst a sturdy oak door lies south.

Guards to hone their skills of not only keeping the peace, but to 
wage war. Archery butts, straw dummies, sparring rings, ropes 
and more have been placed about the room, and at all times during 
the day men and women can be seen making use of the facilities. 
The roof is high, a series of lanterns suspended from it that 
brighten the room to easily accomodate for near any eye.

pass through here on their daily duties and tasks, some stopping 
to converse or salute senior officers. The clangs and thuds of 
training drift in from the east, and an occasional injured 
soldier can be seen making their way from that direction to the 
north. To the west a set of double-doors lie, a series of 
shields decorated with various heralds arranged atop of it.

Captain's Bedchambers~
   Though the close-set walls of this chamber are hewn from 
smooth stone, the room is far from bleak, with a richly stained 
wooden floor and a small hearth set alongside the eastern wall. 
The west most wall of the room bears two arches within, both 
glazed with a green glass, granting a view upon the interior of 
the Dome of Stars and the River Anduin that moves through it. A 
secure door is set in the southern wall, allowing access to and 
from the room.

Short Corridor~
   This stone passageway becomes rather chill during the winter 
season of the year, the unglazed stone-windows carved in the 
western wall allowing a cool zephyr to blow through the halls. A 
thick rug fashioned from the hide of some great bear has been 
laid across the floor, providing some comfort for those that 
travel barefoot along the corridor. Thick doors have been set in 
the east and south walls, a golden star painted on the dark-blue 
shield set above the southern door. To the north, a junction of 
this passage and two others can be seen.

Captain's Office~
   This office is only moderately sized, designed as a place to
process paperwork required by the city guards rather than 
audience with individuals or groups. Never the less, it is not
completely devoid of trapping, with a wooden paneled floor and a
large banner that bears the standard of the Osgiliath Watch upon
it covering the western wall. Two doors set in the stone walls
of the room lie to the north and south.

Sergeant's Barracks~
   A strict, military degree of order and tidiness has been 
upheld in this moderately sized room, the designated for the 
sergeants and lower officers of the Osgiliath City Guard. Twin 
rows of aged bunkbeds, each kept in good condition and covered 
with a thick woolen blanket, stretch down alongside the length of 
the barracks, a secure wooden chest placed at either end of all. 
A small hearth rests at the eastern end of the room, a small 
clearing established about it. To the west, an oak door leads 
out of the room.

This hearth has been made from irregularly shaped grey stones, 
and juts out slightly from the wall. A narrow shelf of wood

of stone establishes a small clearing around the hearth. The 
actual fire-pit delves back into the wall a short ways, the 
insides blackened with soot.

Storeroom for room 22204, The Coach and Hall Tavern~
Room for the Coach and Hall Tavern, the tavern of the west side of
Osgiliath. Fairly lowclass place, mainly deals in farmers and minor
merchants. Owner's name is Joanna, family had owned inn for ages.
Friendly girl, knows how to handle rough patrons.

This is an example of the archer box, where the virtual garrison
of Osgiliath can aid the foot soldiers at the gates on either side.
These guys should just fire down at anyone flagged wanted or as
an orc in the rooms.

Northwestern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The pale waters of Morgulduin run to the west and north as the 
river rounds a slight bend, lapping against the rocky shore. The 
bank of the river is barren mostly and in places broken with dirt 
and rocks falling into the water. Shrubs and grasses grow but 
only barely and mostly remain far from the waters edge. The 
sounds of the wind, the occasional bird and the water are the 
only ones that intrude upon this place.

Desolate Sitting Room~
   Though apparently still in use by the lack of dust between the 
several chipped marble benches and the archway in the eastern 
limestone wall, this room bears a great deal of damage upon its 
walls, floor and ceiling. The wide tiles of alternating black 
and white stone that run underfoot here show a number missing, 
packed dirt set in the gaps, and the pitted walls look far from 
their finest. Circular in shape, stone holdings for flower beds 
and other plants ring around the length of the room, containing 
only dry soil. Empty torch sconces span out at head height from 
the walls, yet some light enters the room from the east. 
   An archway to the east leads out of the room, to a corridor 
that runs along the Anduin's edge.

Barren Hills Below the Ephel Duath~
   The land here is slightly cracked and broken the lack of 
moisture in the ground causing the landscape to crumble slightly. 
Grass grows here and small green and brown shrubs manage to find 
a place to grow. Trees can rarely be seen being few and far 
between, hidden by the rise and fall of the hills, despite this 
the occasionally tree does appear. 
   An odd formation of rocks juts slightly from the ground, 
rising from the hills.

The Common Room~
  The spacious common room is almost always busy, providing a 
comfortable place for the soldiers to rest when they are not on 
duty. People regularly pass through on various errands. Chairs 
and padded benches stand around the room, and plain brown rugs 
cover much of the gray flagstone floor. A fireplace on the 
western wall offers light and warmth when neccessary. 
   Wooden doors lead north, west, and east; the one beside the 
fireplace seems especially worn. A staircase leads up to the 
second floor, while a short wide corridor opens up to the north.

Rath Earendil Stretches Northwards~
   An array of cobblestones, blackened with soot, blood and 
grime, lie in a rough road once known as Rath Earendil as it 
leads north under the gaze of the walls of a damaged tower. 
Potholes and debris riddle the street, the flagstones of the 
roadside obscured in some places and battered in others. A row 
of bent and ruined lampposts run parallel to the black-cobbled 
road.

Jailhouse Foyer~
   The foyer of the jailhouse of Annon Borough is circular in 
shape; the roof set a moderate distance overhead large slabs of 
white and black stone run underfoot. Built for the purpose of 
processing the sentences and charges of criminals for minor 
matters, the occasional argument between a guardsman and captured 
lawbreaker can be seen on the floor of the foyer. Lanterns 
placed in the walls cast light throughout the room in both night 
and day, and also set on the walls are two banners, one in the 
burgundy color and seal of the Annon Borough and the other in 
black, bearing the White Tree. A set of double-doors lies to the 
west, while a single, iron-bound door is set in the eastern wall.

Top of a Stairwell~
   A pair of lanterns cast oil-wrought light over the area before 
the wide stone stairwell as it leads down to the cells of the 
Star Dome's prison. The faint sounds of men and women calling 
out for food, the rattle of keys and the slamming of doors drifts 
up from below, almost background noise in this otherwise 
noiseless chamber. A stout oak door set in the western stone 
wall leads out to the foyer of the jailhouse, but otherwise there 
are no other exits save the staircase.

Among the Cells at the Bottom of a Stairwell~
   This confined chamber has been cut from grey stones, with 
irregular stone walls and floor. Dank and chill run through the 
area, moss and mould gathering in corners and between the cracks 
of the stone used to construct the passageway. Numerous doors 
lead off from here, each of stout oak and bound with iron bars, a 
heavy lock set in each one, and from behind them comes the 
occasional noise of movement. Burning lanterns illuminate the 
room, set about the wide stairwell set in the centre of the 
chamber. At the base of the stairs, to one side, is an 
iron-banded trapdoor.

Dank Cell~
   This cell is damp and dank, unlit save what light comes 
through the door. Taller then most men, and constructed from 
solid oak reinforced with iron bands, a small window crossed with 
iron bars completes the door. Neat stone walls, floor and 
ceiling reside close together, making the small space cramped. 
The occasional shout and slam can be heard, seemingly distant.

Musty Storeroom~
   Racks ring about the rough-cut stone walls of the storeroom, 
bearing upon them a great number of burlap bags, some full and 
stencilled with the name of prisoners others empty and awaiting 
use. A musty smell rises up from the contents of the room, the 
cause being clothing long gone unwashed or used. A thick door 
made from oak has been set in the eastern wall, but otherwise 
there are no obvious exits from this room.

   The base of a rusted metal staircase rises up from the rubble 
here, shearing off a few steps up. It seems as if a two-story 
building has been destroyed, soot-covered stones laid in a 
haphazard manner by some force. Little else meets the eye here, 
the ruin just another familiar sight in the destroyed streets of 
Osgiliath. A door lays fallen, halfway on the street and halfway 
in the pile, a rotten affair.

Zelthar's House of Healing~
   Visibly the workplace of a respected healer, this room is well 
decorated, and is kept exceptionally clean and well-lit. The 
floor, built of even, well-waxed mahogany planks, is carpeted by 
a lush tea-colored woolen carpet. All four of the walls are 
covered with rows of stained, dark-colored shelves filled with 
all sorts of multicolored jars and long-necked bottles; the only 
exits out of the room are by a descending narrow spiral staircase 
or through a wide door set in the northern wall. Several dozen 
enormous candles are evenly arranged around the room, providing 
even, and very bright lighting for the windowless room.

A Crumbling, Stone-Walled Hallway~
   The stone bricks of this short hallway seem to have a downward 
slope as they lead deeper into what appears to be a tomb. Old, 
deteriorating statues line either side of the hallway, and a 
number of moldings and murals are etched into the walls. Many of 
the murals have long since faded, but some depict great battles 
outside of Minas Ithil in the days before it became Minas Morgul. 
Bones of unknown origin are scattered across the ground, turned 
dry and brittle over time. The passage continues to the south 
while a large slab of stone can conceal the exit to the north.

An Ancient, Dust-Filled Tomb~
   A thick layer of dust clings to everything in this chamber, as 
numerous, ancient sarcophagi have been left to crumble away to 
the ages here. The stone walls seem to press in on all sides, 
carved with hideous faces that stare malignantly upon any who 
enter. A faint smell of acrid decay also lingers here, and an 
endless dripping sound rings out from some dark corner. The only 
way in or out of this crypt is a stone passageway to the north.

A Spacious, Half-Collapsed Hall~
   This old hall is made of stone, parts of it collapsed, the 
large stones creating pits upon the ground where timber has 
splintered itself into jagged, lethal fragments. The dark wood 
remaining is a rich, reddish-brown color, the brown accentuated 
in places almost like a professional stain applied to the careful 
master's work which was this house. The floor, a dusty, dirty 
affair of dark wood, holds the remains of fallen lamps, their 
metal frames twisted like beasts in the final throes of tortuous 
death, their glass panes shattered upon the ground. Windows, 
battened shut and boarded up, allow what little light there may 
be to filter through, exposing parts of the room and casting 
others into shadow. A back corner staircase, the odd step 
missing, leads up to a second floor, a carved railing seeming to 
have escaped the damage. The entirety of the building has 
collapsed to the south, a sliding pile of rubble preventing 
movement and sight to that end.

   Stairs lead up and down from the remains of what was once a

of the floor, its length cutting off with a sudden sharpness, 
becoming a pile of stone and timber strewn rubble. To the north 
lies a wall made of dark wood, its surface charred, which 
connects to the eastern wall. This wall sports several gaping 
windows and holes, allowing one a clear view into the street

and destruction. A skeleton hangs in the air, a few bits of 
rotten flesh and cloth still covering what the vermin did not 
take, its neck twined about a piece of wire from a large timber 
sticking out of the rubble and its jaw ajar in a silent scream.

constantly moving up and down the counter attending to patrons. 
Sometimes climbing the ladders and racking that line the walls to 
get to the stock stored above easy reach. Long lengths of timber 
and whole tree logs have been hoisted up and layed across the 
rafters of the building. In the western wall of the building is

   This small shack is shabbily constructed from rough hardwood 
planks and large unfinished pieces of timber. The floor is 
somewhat uneven, with many of the floorboards slightly disjoined, 
and sticking up at irregular angles, but it is very sturdy and 
immobile, having been secured to the thick branches of the oak 
tree with thick, strong hemp rope. The walls and roof aren't 
well constructed, as they barely keep out the weather; the 
various holes, though, allow someone to easily fire missile 
weapons at anyone lingering beneath the tree. A rope ladder

A Storeroom~
   This is a storage room for Alewynn the leatherworker of
Osgiliath. The room is small, with a ceramic tile floor that
looks like it's seen better days. The walls are panelled in
wood that has gone dark with age. A very small, squat window
lets in a little light, but even it is barred.

The Osgiliath Chandler~
   Housed in a small stone building, this shopfront is equally
small, but invitingly arranged, with shelves on the walls and
a display rack near the back. The walls are panelled in dark
wood, and the floor, what is visible of it underneath the rugs,
is made of wood as smooth and glossy as glass. Lanterns arranged
here and there let in light when the windows can't.

   Tastefully furniture has been arranged about this moderately 
sized room, stuffed chairs and a small table, granting it a 
cordial feel to it. Laid over the cold stone floor is a wide, 
regal blue, carpet, and hanging from the walls are numerous 
tapestries and war relics. A glazed-glass window is set in the

Twisted Path~
   Twisting a crooked course through scattered piles of refuse 
and fallen masonry and timber, this path more closely resembles 
an alley than a true street as it leads through the abandoned 
slums of western Osgiliath. The tattered and ramshackle homes 
and warehouses that lay either side of the dirt-street are 
uninhabited, flaking paint and rotting wood a testament to the 
lack of life in this area. A huge building, once constructed of 
stone, now resides only as a mound of rubble to the north, the 
path skirting about it, while the building to the south is being 
refurbished and rebuilt, a number of masons continually working 
on it day in and day out.

'Osgiliath's Golden Cat Tavern'~
   Entrance and exit to this partially restored warehouse is 
granted through a wide, iron-banded door that was built right 
into the now nailed-shut double-doors that take up a sizeable 
portion of the northern wall. The floor is stained and scratched 
but reasonably clear, though a few ale-spills and scattered 
westmansweed ashes could use cleaning up. Rats and cockroaches 
can be seen occasionally, scurrying about beneath the bar and in 
the shadows of the crowded, cluttered room. The new-looking 
bartop is unpolished but sturdy, and stretches out before most of 
the southern wall, a small swinging half-door allowing barmaids 
to pass between the space behind it and the tavern proper. A 
sturdy but unstained wooden staircase winds its way up the 
eastern wall, its pale hues offering stark contrast to the dark, 
weathered stone of the original warehouse walls. Despite the 
run-down appearance of the rather-recently-refurbished warehouse, 
a number of patrons are always traipsing about among their own 
business. 
   An obvious later addition lies to the west, past a stylized 
archway.

A Narrow Hallway~
   Movement about the second story of this refurbished warehouse 
brings a gentle creaking of wood, though the recently-replaced 
pale cedar timbers of the floor give credit to the masons who 
rebuilt this building. Doors line the hallway to the west, 
south, and east, and at the end of the hall to the north lies a 
staircase for access to the ground floor of the building. A 
small amount of noise frequently filters in from below, as do the 
smells of food, ale, and especially Westmansweed.

Warehouse Roof~
   Atop the once-prosperous refurbished warehouse, the roof is 
almost entirely new cedar timbers, pale and unstained. The 
rooftop is recently cleaned, though a few small fragments of 
pottery and cloth lie strewn about the area. Though the height 
of the roof is quite great, the one redemption this offers is the 
glorious view granted of the Dome of Stars, the old palace of 
Osgiliath, to the east. Dominating the skyline, its off-white 
structure contrasts with the bleak greys and browns of the poorer 
quarter of the city. A metal ladder in the northeast corner of 
the roof leads down to inside the building, while to the south a 
long drop leads swiftly to the unyeilding ground below.

Upon a Filthy, Stone Warehouse Wall~
   Moss grows abundantly about the southwards facing stone wall 
of the warehouse. The wooden structures added about it suggest 
that the rotted timbers of the building are a more recent 
construction than the original rock. Still, its grainy surface 
has been subject to many a harsh storm, and numerous handholds 
for the brave exist to try to scale the wall. Two stories in 
height, the occasional bird's nest nestled in the cracks and 
crevices of the shifting masonry by those moving up or down the 
surface wall. Downwards lies the hard, flat packed earth of a 
backlot.

Backlot Before a Squat Stone Structure~
   Though it seems to be clean enough, this small, rectangular 
lot between buildings reeks of an utterly foul stench that never 
fails to assail the human nose. The northern and southern sides 
of the backlot are bordered by a variety of ruined buildings. A 
huge pile of rubble on the northern section was clearly once a 
building. The lot continues westward, while a small hut sits at 
the eastern corner of this backlot.

Fence-Bordered Backlot~
   This area was once perhaps the back lot of a thriving 
business, and the stone building to which it once belonged lies 
off to the east. The ground here is dirty and foul-smelling, and 
the occasional piece of fallen stone or broken timber can be seen 
littered around the weedy, vine-choked ground here. Numerous 
rodents and other alley life skitter and scamper along the ground 
at sight of a human presence. A recently crafted pale cedar 
fence borders the lot to the north, south, and west, and from 
these directions, the slight sounds of the city drift in.

Alleyway Entrance~
   There is little difference between the entrance of this alley 
and the street of Western Osgiliath to the east. Perhaps once a 
noble road itself, now this dirt path winds its way through the 
derelict buildings of the city slums, structures long vacated of 
any human residence, now occupied by bats, vermin, spiders and 
dust. No citizens of the once-fair city can be seen passing 
through here, and the alley splits at the stone wall of an 
ancient stone storehouse to run west and south.

Narrow Gap Between Buildings~
   It is a slight squeeze for larger specimens of the human race 
to move through this area, the alley here being little more than 
a gap between two rows of equally abandoned buildings. The dirt 
path, leading east and west, is made even more precarious by the 
debris littered across it, the obstacles made up of fallen 
timbers to refuse and street-animal corpses. Despite the 
neglect, many of the houses have survived, due to the lower floor 
being constructed of stone, a reminder of the lost prosperity of 
the city.

Backlot of Abandoned Buildings~
   To the north, east and west a number of dilapidated buildings 
turn their backs to this section of the alleys that crisscross 
the slums of Western Osgiliath, forming a small back lot. 
Boarded windows and doorframes clearly mark the absence of human 
inhabitation for this area, save one building to the north. 
Ancient garbage litters the area, present in all shapes and 
forms, broken glass and pottery here and there, a large pile of 
wooden remains nestled in a corner. To the south, a wide passage 
leads out of this area, while a narrow gap sits eastwards.

Junction of Two Alleyways~
   Two pathways through the ramshackle and non-maintained housing 
of the city form a junction here, its packed-dirt street trod by 
none save the swarm of rats and other alley life that thrives in 
this area. The directions of north, east and west all lead 
through the dark buildings, the twin stories of the houses 
casting an early shadow over the refuse-cluttered streets early 
and late during the day, at night a pitch darkness falling in its 
place. A decrepit house borders the alleyway to the south.

Alley Before a Stone Building~
   A large, secure building fashioned from grainy, white stone 
borders the northern side of the alleyway here, its small windows 
covered over with planks of wood. Moss grows freely along the 
lower ranges of its stone structure, and fungi extending to make 
parts of the rough-shod path of dirt here slippery to those 
careless of foot. The alley makes a crooked, twisted path to 
both the east and west, past more derelict and abandoned houses.

Sharp Twist in the Alleyway~
   The alleyway makes a sharp turn from north to west here, its 
path forced so by a large shipment of now rotted lumber never 
collected by its distant owner. A thick layer of dirt serves as 
the means with which to make progress along this narrow road, but 
still some fragments of the original cobbles stick at odd angles. 
Ramshackle huts built from scrap material and the gutted remains 
of once grand town-houses line the street either side, empty 
shells holding nothing of any value to anyone.

remnants of a elegant building now ruins in the streets of 
Osgiliath, a sad reminder of the cities hallowed past. With the 
collapse of the stone structure, progress can be made to and from 
the street of Rath Earnil to the west and the dark alley that 
runs eastward, the dirt path trodden by no civilians of 
Osgiliath.

   Fungi, moss and mould cover much of the floor on the eastern 
half of this basement, a pool of putrid and stagnant water form 
and oozing from cracks in the stone wall. The rest of the room 
is bare, save for the domain of dust and cobwebs formed intricate 
patterns about the other half of the room. The air is cool and 
damp in the basement under the warehouse, still and lifeless, yet 
a slight wind sometimes creeps through the trapdoor at the 
southern end of the area. A large hole has been knocked out in 
the northern most stone wall, the darkness uninviting. A large 
hole has been knocked into the southern wall, as well.

Narrow, Smooth-Walled Tunnel~
   This narrow tunnel that leads downard slightly to the north is 
not formed from the earth, rather, a long, straight stone passage 
of ancient architecture, especially so when compared to the more 
recent stone walls constructed at the south of the tunnel. Old, 
runic writing, slightly similar to the Numenian-Tengwar script 
employed today in Gondor, is barely visible along the eastern 
wall of the tunnel, running a short distance at about waist 
height to a man. To the south, a charred pile of rubble and 
timbers blocks the way, while to the north the passage leads into 
a larger chamber. There is only enough for single-file travel 
down this passage, and all but the smallest of men are forced to 
bend over somewhat to progress through here.

the ceiling. Smaller pieces of stone chipped and scarred by 
whatever ordeal fell the roof so many years ago. A large, 
circular door constructed from iron and impossibly heavy lies in 
the floor, amidst the rubble. A tunnel stretches out to the 
south, leading out from where the door's large hinges rest in the 
wall. Another iron door, this one still attached to the wall, 
lies to the west.

Short, Narrow Tunnel~
   The eastern side of this tunnel is built from expert masonry, 
yet it leads only a short way before succumbing to a heap of 
fallen rubble. Yet someone had taken pains and efforts to move 
stone, and an earthen tunnel leads on westwards from that point. 
The passage holds room enough for only a few people, and the 
centre of the path is free of cobwebs and dust which is more than 
can be said about the low roof and edges. A colossal iron door 
sits at the eastern end of the tunnel, with an intricate series 
of hinges and pulleys. To the west, the tunnel enters a hole 
knocked through a stone wall.

Southwards, an oak door, once reinforced with iron bands, is no

   This medium-sized, secure-looking shop is the bottom of a
two-level stone building. Its floor and walls are wood-panelled
in some kind of dark hardwood and its windows, though small, are
paned in real glass in a diamond pattern that diffuses sunlight
through the whole room. A rug covers most of the floor, with
genteel display cases set up along two walls to show some of
the goods for sale.

   A long, wooden workbench takes up the entire northern wall of 
this room, carrying numerous tools of the trade and several works 
in progress. Perpetually surrounding the work area is a thin 
layer of sawdust and woodchips on the floor, though it seems some 
effort is made everyone once in a while to sweep it to a side. 
Oil lanterns hanging from the ceiling keep the room fairly 
well-lit at all hours of the day and night. A small staircase 
leading to the second floor runs up along the western wall, 
adjacent to a light blue curtain.

Decrepit House~
   A rickety, neglected wooden frame forms half of this house, 
the interior bared to the sky through timber slates once covered 
by thatch. This poor workmanship has been built upon a far more 
secure stone base, remnants from some previous age of the ancient 
city of Osgiliath. A large mound of dirt, scattered with 
miscellaneous refuse, slopes upwards against the southern wall of 
the single-room house, soot and dust decorating the rest of the 
space, but little else remains here. A thin, wooden door leads 
north.

slope to a couple of wooden buildings near the corner where the

   This old shopfront seems to have been abandoned, the furniture

of the wall has collapsed, allowing entrance and egress to the 
street. The door lays on the floor, also allowing one to move 
through the open doorway. This building seems otherwise in 
fairly good condition, save for a few collapsed pieces of timber 
and glass on the ground. Broken pots and withered plants lay on 
the ground, lending the smell of rot to the room. Two empty 
windows, their panes nothing but shattered glass, allow one to 
look onto the street. The doorway to the north seems to have 
been collapsed, the frame splintered and large stones blocking 
the way through. A wooden staircase has survived, leading 
upstairs through a door which hangs upon a single hinge, bent 
inwards.

A Coverered Crenellated Wooden Structure~
   Wooden steps lead down to a platform through a hatch set in 
the south-eastern corner of this freshly-constructed wooden 
fortification. A four-panelled pointed roof rests atop many 
thick logs which form a crenelation effect through which archers 
may fire and behind which soldiers can shelter. Nearby, to the 
south-west, the ruins of the Great Dome rises up out of the 
Anduin, almost touching the exposed stone floors and crumbling 
walls of a building to the south, almost close enough to jump. 
Eastwards a long alleyway can be seen. 
   A timber ramp leads downwards to the north through an open gap 
in the structure wide enough only for crates and people.

on either side of the gap by a simple L-shaped downward facing

Earth-Stained Cellar~
   Solid walls built of regular blocks of white limestone forms 
the small cube of this cellar, yet they are barely visible now 
given the large amount of dirt and mud that cakes the entire area 
of the basement. There is little clue as to what has caused the 
cellar to be stained thus, but occasionally a trickle of dirt 
creeps through the wooden ceiling of this room. The southern 
wall of the basement has had a moderately sized hole knocked in 
it, a dark tunnel large enough to accommodate a human stretching 
out, while a trap door sits in the centre of the ceiling here.

Twisting Hand-Dug Tunnel~
   Being the result of hard labour of hands, spades, shovels and 
any other tool used for digging, this tunnel looks to have been 
dug-out many years ago. The cool air sits stagnant in the 
passageway as it makes a series of sharp, twisting turns that 
changes its direction northwards where it meets a dead end of 
collapsed foundations. These numerous modifications seem to have 
been made in mind of existing structures, as pieces of stone 
masonry can sometimes be seen through the dirt walls.

Turn in the Underground Route~
   Pale, near-eerie roots of small plants and vegetation jut out 
from the earthen roof of this small tunnel as it works its way 
through the underground. Slightly chillier than up on the 
surface, the air is slightly moist here in this passage, a small 
scattering of mushrooms growing rampant at the base of the 
north-east corner of the niche. The westernmost section of this 
tunnel looks to have been carved by hand and shovel from the 
dirt, while to the south ruined masonry can be seen.

Gloomy Intersection of Passages~
   Three passages lead in from the north, east and south to form 
this dank and lonesome intersection beneath the ground. The trio 
of pathways could not be more varied from one another. From the 
north a short construction of well placed stone extends out, 
covered in dust and cobwebs that tell of countless years gone 
past since the chamber has been in use. Eastwards, the dirt 
ceiling juts down for a brief instant, forcing those passing that 
way to crouch in order to pass through, and looks to be the 
remains of a collapsed street. A rough tunnel has been cut 
directly out of the earth by human muscle to the south.

East and West on a Collapsed Street~
   Ancient cobblestones of a triangle and hexagonal pattern pave 
this desolate street as it heads east to west under the ground of 
the city above. Stretching only a short distance, and by no 
means straight and orderly, the roof of the street is made up of 
a combination of dirt and building stones, supported by the large 
building of stone that line the street to the north and south. 
The road is rather narrow, being little more than a gap in the 
earth under the more recent constructions that lie overhead.

Eastern End of the Subterranean Road~
   The back walls of many a squat, stone house face the paved 
road as it progresses a short distance to the east and west here. 
Movement in the former direction extends only a short distance 
before coming to a forcible halt by a huge mass of fallen slabs 
of masonry, rock and dirt, spilling out into the street beyond. 
Not a soul traverses this long abandoned street as it runs deep 
underground, uninhabited save for the numerous rats and other 
vermin that scour the catacombs freely. A door built from 
rotting wood leads into a small, squat building to the south. A 
blackened, cindered collection of timbers and stone block the way 
northwards.

Top of a Marble Stairwell~
   The northern half of this small chamber has been built from 
matching blocks of white limestone, strong and sturdy in 
construction, but with little flair of grace. A wooden door is 
set in a square hole cut out for it in the wall, its panels weak 
but the seemingly out-of-place bolt still functional. The 
southern half, however, is one of opulence and richness fallen 
low. A staircase formed of marble spirals downwards, and a 
shattered mural hangs over the south most wall. The two sides 
look mismatched together, the product of separate ages of 
building, and where they join a slight step up to the north is 
required.

Narrow Dirt Burrow~
   With enough space to perhaps fit only four to five people in 
here at once, this little burrow has been created by the work of 
human hand, sloping downwards slightly to the west. Wooden 
boards, slightly rotted and moderately damp, support the ceiling 
of this small enclave, mud visible through the cracks and 
knotholes of the rather lackluster construction. The air here is 
tight and dry, and the only sounds to be heard are the scampering 
of rodents. An intersection of passages lie to the north, while 
the west is shrouded in darkness.

Cylindrical Sewage Pipe~
   Made from lead, this large pipe is immensely tarnished, its 
walls covered in rust, and where they are not, lichen and moss 
grows wildly. A thick layer of dry, crispy mire, contained of 
things far worse than normal dirt and garbage, covers the floor 
of this pipe, letting off a foul smell when disturbed. Sounds 
echo loudly among the water fare, flowing into the pitch black 
that lies at either end of the tunnel. Great volumes of earth 
have collapsed upon the east end of the tunnel, however, a route 
has been dug on a steep slope through this barrier. Westwards 
the pipe continues on.

Grime-Caked Watercourse~
   To the east and west this large pipe runs, ending in stark 
darkness at either end. Large enough for a man to easily stand 
full height in, this tunnel was perhaps once used to move water 
throughout the ancient city of Osgiliath, back in its days of 
glory as Gondor's capital. Now, however, tarnish and fungus rule 
here, a thick film of grime and muck coating the lower half of 
the rounded, metal pipe. Located in the centre of the roof of 
the pipe is a small metal grating, its bars rusted much the same 
as the damaged ladder forged into the northern wall of the pipe 
which allows one access to it. As the tunnel heads west, is 
quickly descends, the surface becoming slippery and slick.

Gaping Hole in the Sewage Pipe~
   The cold, greasy metal of the pipe continues no more to the 
west here, instead, angling sharply downward to a gaping, wide 
hole. At some stage horrific trauma and strain has been applied 
to the tunnel, forcing its lead walls to tear and lead in its new 
direction. The floor surrounding the pipe is littered with 
fungus and moss, hazardous and slippery to any who move about the 
area, while the ground becoming more secure as one moves to the 
east. Dry, stale air wafts out from the hole, presenting an odd 
smell to the nose, but the bottom is far too away to make out 
with any light from this vantage point.

Vertical Climb on a Slippery Tunnel~
   Running almost sheer vertically, this section of broken 
pipeline is perhaps ten feet in length, constructed from lead 
that is now badly dented and tarnished. Wide enough across to 
accommodate even the tallest of men, pieces of limestone and 
other masonry have broken through the pipe in some places, 
jutting out at odd angles. A slimy, slippery film of mud and 
other refuse coats the eastern side of the pipe. Despite all of 
this, handholds formed from wood and the intruding stone have 
been set alongside the eastern-edge of the pipe, allowing one 
determined enough to scale it. At the top of the pipe is 
darkness, while the bottom opens out to a larger chamber.

Caved-In Building~
   A thick carpet of dust has been laid over the cold stone floor 
by the patient hands of time, the walls and ceiling of this room 
also adorned by a layer of grey grime. The air hangs heavy and 
stagnant, long gone undisturbed by anything fresh from the 
surface. The room is strangely empty, devoid of any furniture, 
trappings, hangings, or features at all, simply four walls, a 
ceiling and a floor, all fashioned from the same well-fitted 
stone. A slender archway has been carved from the northern wall, 
allowing access to and from the next room, while a small hatch of 
splintered wood lies at head height in the wall to the south.

Inside a Partially Demolished Structure~
   Untold tons of large pieces of stone, unshaped rock and dirt 
have laid waste to the northern segment of this room, tearing 
through the stone ceiling and sealing off anything past that 
point. Large streaks of earth and deep scars into the stonework 
of the walls and floor race across this room, but little other 
debris is present in the area. A pair of rusty hinges in all 
that remain of a doorway placed in the eastern wall, no hint as 
to what has happened to the door, while an archway plagued with 
cobwebs grants access to another room southwards.

Tight Chute Through a Collapsed Building~
   With barely enough space for three people to squeeze in this 
narrow niche, this tight-fitting chute extends down through the 
wall of this building for a number more feet. Numerous handholds 
in the forms of cracks in the stonework and a set of wooden 
runners allows one to suspend themselves here in the air, but it 
is a treacherous position at best. Dust and cobwebs hang heavy 
along the walls and roof, continually assaulting the nose. A 
large wooden hatch is set in the northern wall, allowing exit 
from this enclave.

Man-made Underground Passage~
   From the east to the west this passageway leads, carving out a 
space beneath the dark, dank earth under the city of Osgiliath. 
Vermin run underfoot as one passes through here, and neither wind 
nor rain reaches down to these depths. The stone hallway is the 
product of fine masonry countless years ago, the limestone blocks 
that form the walls, ceiling and floor fitting together without 
so much as a knife-blade's space between. Yet, other forces have 
laid waste to this corridor. At the eastern end, it bends and 
turns towards the south, that path blocked by a cave-in from the 
collapsed roof. A hole knocked in the east wall allows access to 
a cellar, while to the west the hallway leads into a partially 
demolished structure.

Stone Cellar With Holes Knocked in its Walls~
   Placed under some building upon the surface of the city, this 
stone cellar is filled with dank, musty air and fast-growing 
lichen. Fashioned from a combination of rough stone and wooden 
planks, a few barrels of food as well as numerous scraps of 
wood and midden litter the cellar, nothing of any value left down 
here. What marks this cellar apart from others is the two large 
holes that reside in its east and west walls. Darkness lies in 
either direction, a few loose stones littering the ground from 
this deliberate act. A trap door in the roof of the cellar also 
provides a means to exit it.

   The upper half of this tidy chamber has been formed through 
carefully laid wooden planks, while the bottom of neatly placed 
blocks of limestone. In whole, the room has been rather well 
kept and is rather tidy, if not barren. No furniture, no crates 
nor barrels nor garbage litters this cellar, and only a few 
cobwebs spread across the ceiling. A hole has been knocked in 
the western side of the room, leading into another cellar, but 
the loose stones from that has been neatly stacked beside the 
hole. A second pile of stack stones lie in the south-east corner 
of the room, from a section of the floor that has been removed to 
reveal a trapdoor leading downwards.

Dank, Stone Cavern~
   The southern half of this chamber is composed of ankle-deep, 
encrusted mire, crunching softly whenever stepped upon and those 
that rest in one place too long experience sinking slightly until 
they reach the hard stone floor. A raised platform forms the 
northern half of the area, inhabited by shrivelled lichen and the 
bones of small creatures, ending in dark-stoned walls to the 
north, east and west. To the south, the dry filth continues into 
a larger area. 
   The water is deeper on the west side of the platform.

Gloomy Nexus of Pipes~
   From all directions pipes run into this dark and foreboding 
hub deep under the pavement of Osgiliath, yet no water emits from 
their leaden mouths. Fashioned from dark, dried-slime encrusted 
stone, a most repugnant and a foul bone-dry stench emerges from 
the knee-deep crusty mire that covers this chamber. Scattered 
brickwork lays about the area, this destruction brought upon by 
the massive lead pipe which has fallen through the roof in the 
centre of the area here, a large section missing allowing one to 
ascend up its slippery surface. The darkness continues to the 
north and east, other areas branching off from here.

Upon a Wide Lead Pipe Leading Upward to the East~
   Darkness too distant to be penetrated by any light lingers 
throughout this area, dripping echoes sounding out against the 
cold metal of this half pipe that leads east and west. Too tall 
and slippery for anyone to scale, the chamber it passes through 
seems gigantic, the odd movements of the stale air and nature of 
any noise made here hinting at the size of the area. The pipe 
descends into a pool of mire to the west, and continues a rather 
steep ascent to the east. Dank but somewhat fresher air wafts 
sporadically from somewhere underfoot, its origins difficult to 
discern, as the pipe and the rusted metal bars covering part of 
the ground are covered in muck.

Inside a Filthy Metal Pipe~
   The confines of this small pipe force any and all inside onto 
their belly, movement only available by crawling tediously 
through the filth encrusted metal walls. Rather long, it leads a 
twisted path, but heads in a general direction from east to west. 
As well as being put onto their belly, those who choose to crawl 
through here invariably end up covered by the dirt, mire and 
grease that coat the ring of the pipe, an equally disturbing and 
unwanted smell emanating throughout the tube. A small grating at 
the western end of the pipe allows one to leave it.

Beneath a Hatch Within an Ancient Water Duct~
   The metal walls here feel smooth to the touch, any impurities 
in the lead worn down by the constant flow of water past it. 
However, now the water lies stagnant, only a thin puddle refilled 
from a slight drip in the side of this tiny tunnel, the size 
compact as to force all those who wish to move through here to do 
so on their belly. Lichen grows freely along the low roof of the 
pipe, a few pale toadstools sprouting out to brush the face of 
those who pass through here. The tunnel continues to the west 
for some distance, and at the eastern end, a large hatch made of 
numerous bars of rusted iron allows an exit out to the surface.

Eastern End of the Large Lead Pipe~
   Broken stone and masonry litters the floor of this large, lead 
half-pipe. yet the source remains unknown, pitch dark residing 
in the distance for any who gaze upwards. Large sections of 
tarnish and moss roam across the high walls, reaching far taller 
than a man's head, and as the pipe proceeds further to the east, 
so does it become steeper. At a far point to the east, once the 
upward climb has become near impossible without the aid of rope 
or other tools, the pipe ends, opening onto a dark abyss, 
uprising currents of air bringing strange sounds to the ear. To 
the west, the tunnel descends.

possible through the use of gaps and holes in the masonry. A 
jumble of waste and wooden remains litters the bottom of this

Abandoned, Forgotten Room~
   Small in size, this abandoned room differs from the rest of

and heavily damaged, though the structure is sturdy, and the 
architecture is one of squares. Numerous rat warrens have been 
formed out of unidentifiable piles of midden, granting the 
stagnant air a putrid quality here. The eastward leading archway 
from the room bears two iron hinges, yet the door seems to have 
long rotted away. Located halfway up the southmost wall is a 
small head of fragile wood, opening into a small chamber.

Dust-Lined Intersection Within an Age-Old Building~
   Two passageways that cut straight paths through this ancient 
building meet here at an intersection, continuing towards to the 
north, east and west. Stale air resides throughout the 
surroundings, and distant echoes of rock falls and sliding rubble 
occasionally sound out throughout the stone walls. A few 
footsteps are visible in the heavy layer of dust and grime that 
covers the floor, a testament to the fact that some life passes 
through this abandoned city. In the southern wall, a large 
window frame opens outwards to a drop down to a street below.

Rubble-Littered Marble Hallway~
   The nobles and rulers of Osgiliath may have once graced this 
broad, tall hallway. However, now it lies in ruin, a carpet of 
dust covering the floor and stale, humid air hanging heavily 
between its walls. The marble etching that covers the stone 
walls bears many holes and marks in it, and the eastern side of 
the hallway is covered in debris from the collapsed roof. Rock 
of all size, shape and style has been scattered wildly by this 
disaster over the area, providing a hazard for the feet of the 
unwary. To the north and south the hallway continues.

Circular in dimensions, the base of the staircase is rather 
large, perhaps once serving as a place to pause and meet others 
before the heavy blanket of cobwebs was laid over everything in 
the room. Rusted, frail torch brackets ring around the 
circumference of the area, save for an archway set in the south 
wall which opens onto a hallway leading through the ancient

juts out before it, making all the surfaces here slippery and 
treacherous to grasp and hold at, and posing a very real risk to 
falling onto the large pile of masonry that lies below. Above 
lies a ceiling of packed earth, pale roots hanging down into the 
empty space. A slow drip of water from the roof gathers in a 
pool of the window ledge. To the north, a broken metal 
window-frame allows access into a large building, darkness 
clouding what may lie there.

Archaic Passageway~
   Any movement throughout this passageway causes the copious

series of arched windows runs across the southern edge of this 
room, yet viewing past the last remaining fragments of glass held 
in the frame, a combination of rock, stone and earth is the only 
sight visible. The marble-faced corridor continues onwards to 
the east and west, its destination shrouded in darkness. To the 
north, a splintered-wood door opens inwards on rusted hinges.

Sprawling, Empty-Shelved Library~
   The remains of a once-grand library are contained within the 
stone walls of this section of the building. Perhaps a dozen 
bookshelves, fashioned from fine stone, line the western, 
southern and northern, edges of the room, as well as dominate the 
centre, forcing those who wish to travel through the library to 
worm their way past them. However, where books once rested, now 
only yellowed and torn scraps of parchment coated with dust lay. 
The shredded and illegible paper covers the floor as grains of 
sand cover a beach. A second wing of the library opens out to 
the east, while a door lies between the bookshelves to the south.

feet below, the eastern wing of the library is in similar

mercilessly by the march of time, and what has avoided being 
ripped and cast upon the floor is instead yellowed and faded to a 
point of illegibility. Small vermin nest in the rough debris

Damaged Room in a Musty Structure~
   The white limestone that forms the walls, ceiling and floor of 
this room has by some great effort by worn down to a smooth 
surface, the blocks of stone fitting together in a manner that 
the entire area gives the appearance of being hewn from one great 
stone. Yet, despite the curious workmanship that has built these 
walls, large cracks run along the domed roof, occasionally 
leaking a trail of earth and pebbles onto the floor where a 
sizeable amount already lies. A few tatters of wood still

Oddly Shaped Construction Built Atop an Existing Area~
   Though this entire room has been constructed from stone, the 
differences readily apparent between the upper and lower sections 
of the area. Rough, irregular blocks of white stone formed the 
ceiling and top walls, placed with little artistic flair but in a 
manner to survive the ages, and judging by the amount of cobwebs 
adorned over them, they seem to have done so. The bottom half 
also lays built of limestone, but worn smooth and circular in 
structure, looking to have been built in an age previous. A 
graceful archway leads north out of this room, while a large 
trapdoor placed in the centre of the ceiling allows access 
upwards.

Entry Hall of a Forsaken Building ~
   The stagnant, musty air hangs heavy in this small, circular 
room, drifting slowly by the thick layer of niter and cobwebs 
that covers the walls and ceiling, but for the most part is 
absent from the floor. A series of a dozen small windows rings 
about the circle walls, yet rather than offer a glimpse onto the 
outside world, they have been filled with rubble and earth. A 
pair of large yet weak doors set in the eastern wall allows 
access out onto the abandoned streets of the catacombs of 
Osgiliath, the windows either side of the door granting one a 
view of the forsaken labyrinth. Another door leads west into the 
interior of the building.

Deserted, Bleak Plaza~
   Large enough to hold a moderate sized crowd quite comfortable, 
the days of such numbers being gathered here in this plaza are 
long gone. What may have been once a beautifully paved area, 
with a large fountain set directly in the middle, is now coated 
with grime and filth, a heavy blanket of dust set over this, 
completely the derelict appearance of the plaza. Movement to the 
north, east and west is halted by the sheer walls of the earth 
itself, mud, stone and dirt having collapsed in these directions, 
rising up high into the darkness. To the south the cobblestones 
continue.

Eerie, Unpopulated Street Deep Underneath Osgiliath~
   To the north and south this street runs as straight as an 
arrow, yet the building it passes are half-buried by the dirt and 
earth that has risen up about and over this city street. Over 
head there is a good dozen feet of room between the shattered 
cobblestones and the ceiling of pale-roots and stone, yet every 
once in a while a trickle of dirt falls from there to the ground. 
Sounds made in this area echo oddly off the sheer amount of 
collapsed mason-work here, stretching on and down through the 
pitch black that continues to the north and south.

Turn in the Desolate Path Before a Large Building~
   A hazard to unprotected feet is presented here by the sharp 
edges of the masonry expelled by the collapse of the buildings 
that line the street as it turns from heading to the north and 
east here. Constructed of a design archaic to the current tastes 
of Gondorian architecture, these large, airy buildings now sit 
destroyed by the unmeasurable mass to stone and dirt deposited on 
them, utterly destroyed by whatever force of natured created 
these catacombs deep under the surface. The street turns here to 
head north and east, and to south lies a single building that has 
survived this cataclysm, though the upper floors have been laid 
to waste.

Upon a Crumbling Arch in the Subterranean City~
   A curved arch slowly rises up at the road heads to the east, 
designed to rise above the street below it. However, at this 
section of the city long ago was consigned to dwell beneath the 
surface, the integrity of the arch has faltered, and now lies 
crumbling, the masonry work shifting as weight is put upon it. 
One slide of stone and mortar has already occurred, allowing one 
to clamber down it to the north and rejoin the street. A short 
distance to the east the archway ends in a wall of rubble and 
dirt, while to the west the street leads past the abandoned 
buildings.

Turn in the Stagnant-Aired Flagstones~
   The air here in this subterranean city is dry and stale, 
sitting stagnant, difficult to breath and acrid to the nose. 
Cobwebs stretch out along the great boulders of limestone, and a 
thick layer of dust coats over everything in the area. The 
underground street makes a turns from the east to south here, yet 
as one approaches the latter way they are confronted with a large 
pile of rubble, scaleable though at a the price of hard work. 
The ceiling of earth hangs low in this section of the catacombs, 
forcing those of tall stature to stoop down in some places when 
traversing through here.

Perfectly-Paved City Street Heading East and West~
   Beginning and ending in the pitch-black darkness that is ever 
present in this bone-dry tunnel deep underground, the pavements 
that lead both east and west have been placed with a skill most 
extraordinary, the cobbles fitting together so tight to prevent 
even a knife blade from sliding between them. Laid over every 
surface here with great care is an all-encompassing blanket of 
niter, and any quick movements through the area cast up the dust 
into the air, creating near fog conditions in the under-gloom.

Atop a Pile of Long-Fallen Masonry~
   Mismatching pieces of masonry and stonework cover the ground 
here, forming a rough, ever-shifting pile held together largely 
by the spider webs that span across it. The dilapidated and 
abandoned stone buildings to the south, east and north have 
contributed to the heap, the wrath of time and the great 
apocalypse that delivered tonnes of earth and stone onto this 
underground city thrusting the stonework of bordering structures 
into this area. The pile slopes downward to the west, and a few 
cobblestones can be seen, the beginnings of a street that soon 
disappears in the darkness of the catacombs. Above, a 
lichen-inhabited window ledge lies.

Ancient, Pillared Hall of the Bath House~
   The smooth-stone walls of this building feel as marble to the 
hand, a testament to the great skill and ingenuity that fashioned 
this building so long ago. A dozen fluted stone pillars support 
the stone ceiling, each a perfect replica of the next in line as 
they lead north to south, placed at the edges of this wide 
corridor. While the progression of time may have left the 
structure of the archaic architecture in good condition, the 
progression of spiders can clearly be traced, gossamer threats 
spanning the roof and walls. A small chamber leads off the 
hallway to the east.

   This small chamber offers little room for movement, being 
nothing more than a space in the structure of the Bath House once 
used for storage purposes. Save for the small arch which leads 
out to the main hall to the west, every other wall has had half a 
dozen large sections taken out of it, effectively forming 
numerous shelves, each now containing moulded scraps of 
unidentifiable waste. Cold stone forms the ceiling and walls, 
while the cracked, mosaic-tiled floor continues to the west.

score of tiny human ships battering against the ocean's might. 
Opposite the meticulous work upon the floor, the ceiling is 
equally ruined, large cracks running throughout the stonework, 
the occasional trickle of dirt falling down to further obscure 
the tiles below. The hall ends to the south here, two large 
chambers leading off to the west and south through archways.

Oppresively-Musty Aired Bath-Room~
   A large bath, with easily enough room to hold half a dozen 
people in it, dominates the centre of the room, set downwards 
into the floor, a small staircase allowing one to climb in and 
out of the marble structure. Yet, whatever waters may have once 
flowed here are long gone, dirt and grime encrusted so thickly 
along the walls of the bath and the room that the original stone 
is hard to see. The air hangs heavy in this room, stale and 
locked away here deep underground for countless years. Shallow 
breathes are a best as one can take, the archway to the east 
providing no escape from this.

   A small section of white-tiled floor leads down via three sets 
of staircases from the northern entrance to this gigantic bath, 
an archway set to the north taking one to the main hall of this 
ancient bath house. At the base of the three small sets of 
stairs lies the floor of this gigantic bath, easily large enough 
to hold well over a score of people. A number of iron pipes can 
be seen jutting out from the western side of the bath, yet the 
south edge has been partially buried by a collapse in the 
white-stone roof, tonnes of loose rock, stone and dirt covering 
the rest of the area in a brown layer of dirt, long undisturbed. 
   However, a small tunnel, scarcely large enough for a tall man 
to stoop through, has been dug, chunks of masonry making up the 
far southern end of the tunnel.

Before a Derelict Building on a Deserted Street~
   All about the area here huge sections of earth and rock have 
fallen, yet despite the great quantity that now resides here, 
even more rests overhead, not more than a dozen feet above the 
ground. Winding throughout the fallout of this natural 
apocalypse is the remains of what may have once been a thriving 
city street, a few shattered remains of buildings having expelled 
their masonry out over the tight-fitting cobblestones that runs 
from east to west here. The street halts in the latter 
direction, coming to the base of a large building that seems to 
have survived rather intact.

   The path of this underground city street shifts from the west

dirt that shift the course of the street in that direction. 
Darkness, deep and boding, blankets the catacombs, stretching 
endlessly in all directions, even when lantern and torch are

it heads south and west are the ruined shells of countless great 
houses, fashioned from stone or brittle timbers, now collapsed 
and crushed by the great press of the earth upon them.

Marble Enclave Covered in Dark Stains~
   This square shaped room is rather small, designed to serve as 
an entry hall and waiting area to a much larger space. Yet, 
whatever its original purpose may have been, the coating of 
cobwebs and dust that now lies here tells the tale that it has 
been many decades since last used. The walls have been hewn from 
stone, yet a thin layer of marble set over this, the softer stone 
now cracked and missing in some areas, revealing the limestone 
beyond. A small domed roof bears upon it a faded painting, the 
details long erased by the passing of time, and now only 
splotches of green and grey are visible. Dark red stains coat 
the floor and walls increasingly so to the east of this room, 
until rubble is reached, where the walls have collapsed. A 
second pair of metal doors lies to the west.

inches of water oozing through it. South and west, tunnels lead

musty and questionable, there's plenty of room to move. The 
gantry, a spiderlike framework leading from the tunnels to the 
opening, looks designed for a wheeled carriage, but none is in

Dank Tunnel~
   This crude tunnel is roughly hewn from the volcanic rock
natural to the region.  There is no light save for that which
filters in from outside.  A stench, vile and repugnant, comes
from the east where the tunnel continues into darkness.

A Loathsome and Foul Pantry~
   Numerous rotting carcasses hang from the ceiling of this 
roundish, humid room. Some are recognizable, but many have 
decayed so much that the original species is unrecognizable. The 
floor is slick with slime and mold. The smell is almost enough 
to render one unconscious.

Airy Loft~
   Set above the busy warehouse floor below, this loft is free of 
any furniture or obstructions save for a number of bunkbeds 
evenly spaced around the northern half of the area. Four large 
shutters run along the southern wooden wall of the loft, allowing 
copious amounts of sunlight into the room during the day. A lone 
shutter has also been placed on the east wall of the loft, sealed 
with a heavy bolt and rather large. Looking through the windows 
allows one to view the near-constant activity of the wharf-front, 
as well as view all that occurs before the warehouse. A small 
door set in the north of the room allows access in and out of the 
loft. A small lantern hanging from the ceiling can be lit on and 
off to cast light over the room.

Tight Backstreet~
   This space is little more than a gap between two large 
buildings. The wall that lies to the west has been fashioned 
from wooden planks and timber supports, newly whitewashed and 
looking to be in good condition. Opposite it, on the other side 
of the alley, thick, weathered planks have been nailed tightly 
together to form an imposing wall. Boxing in the area to the 
north is the cliffside itself, formed of hard, reddish rock, 
rising a good hundred feet into the air, above which is the 
towering limestone city wall. A permanent shadow is cast over 
the area, slipping into utter darkness once night has fallen. A 
small iron ladder rises up the length of the wall to the west.

Small Rooftop Alcove~
   Nestled among the pointed roof of the warehouses of the

fashioned from planks of wood. There is little to see from this 
area, the wooden walls of a warehouse rising around it to the 
north, south and west, while to the east the stone wall of 
another storehouse can be seen. The idle sounds of people moving 
to and fro along the docks drifts up here, the noises muted by 
the distance. The top of a secure, iron forged ladder can be 
seen at the east end of the alcove, leading down into a small 
backstreet. A large shutter can be seen in the western wall of 
the warehouse, big enough for a person to squeeze through.

An Old Apartment~
   The walls of this room and especially the roof are spotted 
with mould. The splintery floorboards are warped and ruined by 
water. An archway to the east with a bare curtain rail leads to 
a smaller room. A sturdy wooden ladder would have led to the 
upper floors but instead the way is blocked by iron strats and 
rubble.

Entrance to the Osgiliath Graveyard~
   Set off the quiet street of Rath Turambar, this wide path 
leads southwards to the graveyard of the city of Osgiliath. Twin 
rows of maple trees run parallel to the pathway, and a number of 
other flowers grow in their beds set at certain points along the 
cobbled way. A high stone wall encloses the compound of the 
cemetery, a gate fashioned from iron bars opening inwards to the 
north, two lampposts set either side of it. 
   To the east a circular building fashioned from stone lies, 
while opposite it to the west is a pair of small stone cottages 
and a dirt path, partially obscured by the flora of the area.

   A number of large slabs of stone dominate the centre of this 
plain limestone building, intended as a place for departed souls 
to be placed whilst waiting to be collected by the tender of the 
Osgiliath cemetery. The building is rather light and airy, a 
number of holes cut from the squat roof allowing in sunlight and 
wind. A number of lanterns mounted on iron brackets and set 
about the area casts light throughout the room once the sun has 
set. The archway to the west of the building is wide, opening

head, have been used to form the walls of this cottage. Wooden 
beams that steeple to a point above the centre of the building 
have been covered with thatch to keep out the worst of the 
weather. Little occupies the stone floor of the sole room of 
this small house, only the most rudimentary of furniture and a

City Graveyard Before the Crypts~
   Numerous stone trails lead through the generously sized city 
graveyard, twisting and turning as they lead past moss and vine 
covered headstones and burial plots. Set alongside the paths are 
various beds of flowers, and the occasional shady tree rises up 
amidst the resting spots of the deceased. The meandering cobbles 
continue to the east and west, leading deeper into the cemetery, 
whilst the gates of the compound can be seen to the north. A 
large building fashioned from stone dominates the southern part 
of the graveyard here, a single door leading into the crypts of 
Osgiliath.

Osgiliath Cemetery~
   The graves that are located in this area of the Osgiliath 
cemetery seem to be slightly more recent than others found within 
the graveyard. Large plots set in the ground and recently dug 
can be spotted amongst the headstones and statues, as well as 
holes recently filled with those departed from this life, the 
fresh dirt at the base of a clean headstone the tell-tale sign. 
Few people walk amongst the narrow paths that wind between the 
rows of graves, those that do often bearing flowers or 
expressions of grieving.

   Countless headstones bearing the names of souls departed from 
this world sit at the head of burial plots within the graveyard, 
yet statues in noble poses or clad in stone armour have also been 
placed about the grass to commemorate the deceased. Limestone 
walls mark the boundaries of the city cemetery, vines growing 
rapidly up and down their stone structure. Cobbled paths lead 
between the rows of the graves, occasionally heading towards 
private family crypts, each securely locked, holding the dead 
within forever more.

Entryhall of the Crypts~
   The stone architecture of a design and construct to an age 
previous to the current, the crypts are still very much in use 
and operation. A narrow tunnel, wide enough for perhaps two 
people to squeeze past side to side, runs a straight course north 
and south. Five long spaces have been cut out from the stone in 
both the east and west walls, and stored in them are countless 
human bones. Skulls peer down with empty sockets at those who 
walk through the crypts, while a distance down the bones of the 
human arm have been stacked neatly in their alcoves. A stone 
door opens to the north, while the building continues to the 
south.

   From shelves cut into the stone walls the bones of the human 
body lie, organised by type and all carefully positioned to 
maximize the amount of storage space available. Each and every 
single bone within the human body has been stored in the crypts 
here, some a dark yellow in colour, others lighter, but all are 
free of any organic remains. There is surprisingly little dust 
or cobwebs in this section of the catacombs, obviously still 
being in use. Stale air rises slowly from a staircase located at 
the end of this tunnel, while fresher breezes can be felt from 
the north.

ornamentation adorning it. From the base of the staircase and 
further to the north, a near solid wall of cobwebs and dust that 
spreads out from every available surface hampers progress through 
the crypts. The bones of those who died many years ago are 
stacked up in alcoves cut from the stone walls, countless remains 
of people now stored below the surface. To the north, the tunnel 
continues further.

   The crypt comes to a halt here, the stone tunnel ending at a

the nite-encrusted stone, the silk spinning of spiders 
crisscrossing the floor and walls, and little sound penetrates 
this far removed from the surface. On the north, east and west 
walls of the crypts, five sections have been cut out from the 
stone, and stored within there are innumerable ancient skulls, 
femurs and ribcages. To the south, the air becomes slightly 
fresher, the tunnel stretching out in that direction.

Ancient, Empty Hall~
   An eerie silence permeates this room, the shadows within 
accentuated by the dark timber which makes up the interior of 
this building. Parts of the timber, mostly by the door, seem 
scorched however it appears as if this building was saved in 
time. The room is bare of any sort of furniture, save for a 
single old threadbare carpet and a fallen candelabrum, its once 
ornate shape twisted and rusted. Faded and torn portraits line 
the walls, and a few fallen shields lay upon the ground, 
gathering dust and dirt. The roof appears to have collapsed to 
the east, blocking the path save for a single small opening 
leading to the outside. An old ladder has been placed here, 
leading up to a second story through a rectangular opening in the 
ceiling. Nothing but rubble lays to the west.

tattered. The door to the north seems to have collapsed with the

grime-and-soot-streaked window, seemingly fused in place.

silent. Historical memorabilia, flags, banners, pendants and 
medals, have been ripped from the walls and hurled onto the floor 
where they lie, burnt, shattered, shredded, and trashed beyond 
repair or symbology. The northern doorframe lays empty, the wood 
where the hinges once were remain, sundered beyond repair. The 
floor is littered with shards of wood and broken stone.

   Every sound echoes off of the walls of this massive circular
chamber, magnifying them to deafening proportions. All around it,
the remainders of tiered seats are little more than wooden shards 
in some places, though the wooden benches have been preserved to 
an eerie accuracy in others. The large doorway leading southward
is empty, bits and pieces of wood all that remain of the doors.
Spidery cracks run along the entire length of the clouded glass
comprising the ceiling, larger and more dangerous looking splits
visible here and there. The image of footsteps have been singed
black into the floor, coming from and leading to nowhere.

A Solarium~
   This small greenhouse has wooden walls and a slatted ceiling
to let some rain and light in. Long benches are built along its
entire side length, one on each side, with ample storage space
below the shelves and on racks set into the walls. Though small,
there's plenty of room here to work. One single door leads into
the main house to the south.

An Intact, Dirty Shopfront~
   The mere fact that this room is intact is a wonder in itself, 
the window looking out into the street showing the amount of 
destruction done. The window, a rather plain affair of 
grime-stained square glass, rests on the grey, dark stones of the 
eastern wall. The stones themselves seem to be paneled with 
moldy, rotten wood, running around the room and barely holding up 
a few shelves. Upon the ground lay some of their brethren, rusty 
nails sticking out from the parts of the wall they took with 
hanging off, and another door leads eastwards onto the ruined 
street.

A Large, High-Ceilinged Room~
   Dirt, grime and mold seem to thrive upon the wood paneled 
stone walls, their once dark, glossy polish turned into an 
epiphany of how abandon may defile anything. Rotten panels rest 
upon the ground, their carcasses home to colonies of woodlice. 
The floor is smooth, almost to the point of being slick with 
dust. Old lanterns, cobwebs upon their fine metal frames, hang 
about the room, doing nothing to illuminate the far reaches of 
the overly high ceiling. High, barred and shuttered windows lay 
to the south, ruin and sky beyond. A moth-eaten curtain lies to 
the west, and a staircase leads upstairs.

A Loft~
   The staircase leads up to a large open loft, taking up the 
entire top floor of the house. Its dusty floor holds a few old 
benches and chairs, a single table tipped over in the corner. 
The ceiling above comes to a high peak, sloping to the east and 
west sides of the room. A glazed window to the east looks out on 
the street below, dust and dirt providing a barrier. Shutters 
allow it to be opened and closed, their wood carved with slits to 
retain vision through from the inside yet prevent it from the 
outside.

the interior, comfortable to be seated on, the deep red colour 
matching the richly hued walls. Two doors allows access in and

   The interior of this room appears fire-damaged, although it 
looks to have been heavily cleaned up in recent times. The wood 
panneling on the walls has been planed smooth and clear of scorch 
marks, or replaced entirely. A large hole in the ceiling has 
been patched with criss-crossing wood in order to protect from 
the weather, and various sconces about the room hold fresh 
torches for when there is little sunlight left to see with. The 
walls have been covered in wooden plaques, mostly empty, except 
for the back wall where a dark black circle with a white tree 
within it has been painted.

gruesome door that appears to be stained in blood. A generally 
poor job was done carving the whole of the door, but it appears 
to have various mouths and gaping jaws carved into it, as if to 
consume any who passed beyond this hallway. Add to this the 
hallway's eerie darkness and the tight confines, and this room is 
doubly frightening to the claustrophobic.

A Poorly-Kept Subterranean Chamber~
   This room has been shoddily renovated in recent times, though 
it bears some semblances of its past. Dank and musty, the air 
hangs heavily, an occasional rancid strech wafting through. A 
series of braziers light the room, and a few bones sporadically 
litter the dirt floor. The walls of moldy, crumbling stone have 
been whitewashed heavily, though some crude paintings and 
drawings of snakes, bats, and wolves show through. The center of 
the relatively-large chamber is dominated by a dias, upon which 
sits a stone throne. A pedastal filled with murky waters rests 
in front of it, and a few shoddy furnishings pepper the area.

A Once-Opulent Courtyard~
   A shell-paved path, wide enough for a carriage, leads from the 
rusted gate to what was once an opulent courtyard. Iron stands, 
each about shoulder-height, lay askew or fallen, glass shattered 
below them. Beyond these lamps and among them lay fields of 
withered grass and greenery, their once-lush figure now a phantom 
of wealth. Trees hang their skeletal limbs in despondent 
despair, leading up to intact brick walls to the east and west. 
An old, boarded-up house stands just past the courtyard, three 
shallow steps, colored a brown tint, leading up to a grimy, 
despondent front door. Two swords have been sunk into the 
withered grass, their rusted blades at the head of twin mounds.

   Rain drizzles down on this courtyard, pelting down onto the
shell-covered path leading from the entry gate to the north to
the opulent home to the south. The path leads past plants and
greenery that are all perfectly maintained. The rain makes the
lamps, in their wrought-iron bases, sputter a bit when they are
lit, but no matter how hard it comes down, it doesn't put them out.
~
~
   Snow blankets this courtyard in a layer of white, obscuring
its features. A wide path that is nearly always shoveled clean
leads from the wrought-iron gate to the north, through the
courtyard to the opulent home just south of here. Tall walls
surround the property, a pile of snow on top of them as well.
Even the lamps, on their tall iron bases, have snow heaped atop
them. 
~
~
   Night blankets this ruined courtyard, no light penetrating the
darkness. A shell-paved path leads towards a derelict, boarded up
home. Iron stands hang askew, glass fragments below them. Withered
greenery give the area the feel of a desolate, abandoned ruin, two
swords reflecting what light is present.
~

   The night darkens the snowy courtyard to pale blue that turns
to gold when the lamps along its path are lit. The lamps are tall,
set on wrought-iron bases, lining the path all the way from the
wrought-iron gate to the north to the opulent home to the south.
The snow covers everything, obscuring features and muffling sound.

   This very large front room is tiled in glossy ivory-colored

north wall look out on the garden courtyard just outside. Lamps 
set along the walls in ornate gilded sconces provide light when 
the windows prove inadequate. Hangings along the windows and 
along the walls provide festive color to the room, in burgundy, 
indigo, forest green, and gold. Hallways lead off in various 
directions, with the house's front door set to the north.

appearing unmoved from where they have fallen from the walls or 
ceiling. Some large nests formed from fur, twigs, and leaves are 
sprawled out here and there. A musky, animal odor hangs thick in 
the air.

A Warm, Smaller Burrow~
   Scraped from softer earth, this den is not as spacious as the 
western lair. It is warm and a little stuffy, and a single large 
nest takes up most of the space here. Some roots protrude from 
the ceiling and walls, pale white contrasting against the dark 
dirt.

A Warmly-Lit Soup Kitchen~
   The stone walls of this circular room show signs of recent 
repair, cracks sealed with caulk and the entire surface scrubbed 
clean of old grime. Overhead, wooden slats have been pieced 
together to form a flat roof, and a fairly high ceiling. Set in 
sconces along the wall and hanging from above are torches and oil 
lanterns that keep the room well-lit at all hours. Several long, 
sturdy tables are arranged across the floor, while a number of 
sleeping pallets are spread out in the back. 
  An old ladder leads to the top of the roof in the back of the kitchen.

happened. Come up with an explanation that seems suitable, and 
please contact an admin if you are still clanned as a Bloodhawk 
mercenary. Going north will take you out to the street.

A Large, Hazardous Room~
   This once large room has been severely cut down by a collapsed 
roof. Just picking one's way through this jumble is hazardous, 
with the overhanging threat of what roof there is left 
collapsing. A staircase in the corner seems to have at one time 
led somewhere, but it is now blocked by a large pile of rubble. 
A hole in the ceiling of this room allows a direct view onto the 
sky, indication that perhaps there is little left of the second 
floor. To the east is a battered but still functional door, and 
to the north is an empty doorway, its guardian nowhere to be 
found.

paneled with dark wood in ragged shape. A large windowframe is

   This room takes up quite a bit of space, connected to the 
southern area with a wide, splintered archway. The walls are 
made of rotting wood, grey stone visible beneath, and a wooden 
floor bearing holes. The holes present flat, hard dirt, the 
edges splintered. In the northern wall is set a diamond-shaped 
window, its pane upon the floor in pieces, which allows a view of 
the street beyond. The layout of the room is about square in 
shape, though what seems to have once been a staircase is now a 
single rail moving up the wall, the steps collapsed onto the 
ground and the other rail nowhere to be found.

A Wide, Grimy Room~
   This rather wide room is rectangular, with a splintered, 
nearly collapsed archway to the north allowing a view of another 
room in a worse state of disrepair. Its front half has a wooden 
floor, dust and grime inhabiting the pores, closely followed by 
grey stones, a few square-shaped while the majority seem to be 
some mutation of the shape. The wall to the south sports a large 
hole, from floor to ceiling, and rather wide. Explanation comes 
in the shape of what at first seems a massive stone statue, 
rotting wooden club extended in a boulder-sized hand, but what 
sight rapidly identifies as the skeleton of a troll.

   A thin ledge runs the length of the wall here, just barely 
enough for a toehold. A window is set in the wall here, the 
ruins below a rather far sight. A long ledge hangs above, 
curling inwards and attached firmly to the wall. The wall itself 
is a tan affair of solid stone, slick and grime-ridden, reaching 
up to a high, sloped roof that ends in a peak. The slope of the 
roof seems slick, quite dangerous to climb.

Balancing Atop A Peaked Roof~
   The air here is cool, sliding over the slick, tiled roof with 
an ease that betrays the precarious nature of its slope. The 
peak has a flat, thin length, just wide enough for a single foot, 
and running the length of the peak. To all sides, a long drop to 
the ground provides little reassurance to the climber. To the 
north, however, another roof lays a few feet away, part of it 
collapsed yet the rest seemingly solid.

An Abandoned, Grimy Building~
   Little remains in this once-large room. A ruined, shattered 
door hangs to the east, allowing entry and exit without 
challenge. A few long, squat tables are placed here, their dusty 
surfaces long out of use. Large stones, most of them broken, 
create a short trail to the northern wall, or rather the lack of 
its majority. Something has shattered it and the wall beyond, 
twin holes bearing numerous skeletons, their bodies picked clean. 
To the west, the door is unmovable, the cause no doubt linked to 
the massive, splintered log piercing its frame.

A Flat, Half-Collapsed Roof~
   This roof is wide, a small, ornamental border wall running the 
length of the edge. The ground is made of sturdy stone, littered 
with a few bits of timber and rubble, and extends a ways around 
before suddenly shearing off to the south. It appears as if the 
rest of this roof has collapsed, what rubble remains sitting in a 
large pile down below, contained within a deserted lot. The 
distance between the roof and the lot is rather long, and one may 
look to the north upon the road. To the east is the peak of a 
roof, a thin ledge running along it. The roof beneath it slopes 
sharply, its tiles slick.

North of a Junction on Rath Siriondil~
   Two cobblestone roads meet at this junction, as Rath Siriondil 
breaks off from Rath Atanatar and runs northward in a straight, 
regal manner. The street is broad, and evenly paved with light 
grey stones that are swept clean of debris. Lampposts hung with 
oil lanterns are placed on either side of the path at regular 
intervals, keeping it lit in the evening hours. A small number 
of people pass through here intermittently, though few loiter 
around for any long periods of time. The road continues north, 
lined with stonework buildings of good, if aged, construction. 
   A flight of stone steps leads up to a stately looking door set 
into the building on the east side of the cobblestone road while 
a colourful, stained glass window set in the front of the 
building on the west side offers a veiled view of a ledge lined 
with perfume bottles.

Passing Through Private Housing on Rath Siriondil~
   A row of stately homes borders each side of Rath Siriondil, 
constructed of smoothly chiseled, off-white stone. Though 
appearing to be of the same age, these buildings have benefited 
from more recent maintenance than those in nearby areas of the 
city. Narrow alleyways run between each residence, littered with 
bits of refuse that have been pushed out of the way of the main 
stone-cobbled road. A junction is visible to the south, where 
another road crosses east and west, while this one keeps 
traveling northward a short distance.

Rath Siriondil Before a Manor~
   The light grey, stone cobbles of Rath Siriondil come to a stop 
before a tall, wrought iron gate to the north. Discernible 
beyond it is a small courtyard, behind which stands an imposing, 
two-storied structure of stone and hardwood. Mounted on the 
walls, flanking the gate, is a pair of oversized sconces that 
hold flickering torches at all hours of the day. The road runs 
in a straight line southward from here, passing through rows of 
well-kept houses.

Filthy Vertical Shaft~
   Big enough in width and breadth to hold only a single person, 
this dark and grimy metal shaft ascends in a vertical direction 
for well over a dozen yards. A series of spaced metal handholds 
have been placed in the surface of the cold, dirt and grime 
encrusted pipe, allowing one to make their way up and down its 
length. Odd, echoing sounds can be heard from the grating that 
marks the end of the shaft's vertical climb, while utter silence 
flows from the grate at the bottom of the pipe.

A Loft~

it takes up most of the space on the second floor. It has a smooth
wooden floor and wood-panelled walls, with hooks here and there for
lanterns. A large window, easily coverable by shutters, looks out
over the street to the east. It is a well-tended room, clean and
reflecting a meticulous owner.
   A staircase leads down to the first floor of the house.

Berendel's Sawmill~
   The buzz of the sawmill is deafening. This complex piece of 
machinery is a mass of metal cogs, wheels and sawblades. The 
smell of oil and water used to cool the blades mixes with the 
strong smells of the wood chips which cover the floor. Logs and 
long lengths of cut timber lie strewn all over the room, only the 
area around the sawmill itself if free of these obstacles.

Lond Nirnaeth~
   The road runs both east and west from this point. Small tufts 
of grass spring up in the road from time to time mingling with 
the occasional smooth stone, which appear to have once been 
cobblestone, though from what time is anyone's guess. For the 
most part the road is made of packed dirt and is lined at the 
edges with tall grasses that come to the knee of a grown man and 
sway in the wind like a sea rippling into the distance both to 
the north and south.

Northeastern Bank of the Anduin Below Osgiliath~
   The mighty River Anduin flows past these riverbanks to the 
west, going from north to south. The land near the river is 
quite fertile, with grass growing and water birds making their 
homes among the reeds that grow near the water. The bank slopes 
gently from the west and the water's edge and rises slightly 
towards the east. Some animals can be seen here though most flee 
when startled. 
   To the north a turret branches off the walls of Osgiliath, the 
city itself stretching out to the west over the River Anduin.

   Some thick branches of this tree run almost parallel to the 
ground, while others curve downwards. The bark is rough to the 
touch, offset by the feathery softness of the willow's leaves 
that brush by with every passing breeze. This high vantage point 
offers a good view of the surrounding lands.

Shopfront of the Silver Saddle~
   Quite spacious, this large wooden stable dominates the western 
side of Rath Romendacil near the eastern gates. Despite the 
large number of animals doubtlessly kept and cared for here, the 
shopfront seems clean and well-organized. A counter stretches 
along the southern wall, a series of shelves to its left and 
right lined with various riding implements. The room's swept, 
wooden floor sprawls outward, heading northward to a decorated, 
oaken door, and westward to where the animals are kept.

earth, some deranged man or beast has been dwelling in this den; 
taking stock of the impressive amount of grisly trophies that are 
collected here, they have prospered. A massive hole has been 
knocked into eastern wall of this area, bone fragments and bits 
of stone scattered around the area.

   This dilapidated bedroom has surely seen better days, for the 
stone floor, ceiling, and walls that make up this square-shaped 
area are splattered with a multitude of unrecognizeable stains 
and a profuse growth of mold. Areas of the walls and floor have 
undergone significant cleaning and scrubbing, and marks upon the 
ceiling indicate attempts to scrub it as well. A small, barred 
window allows view out toward the street below in the southern 
window, and an archway is set in the eastern wall, covered with a 
heavy but ragged tarp. In the southwest corner, a sturdy wooden 
ladder protrudes from a hole in the floor.

almost perfect privacy. A sloped, crumbling tile roof tops the

A Smoky, Basement Gaming Hall~
   A thick layer of smoke hangs in the air of this hidden 
gambling hall, kept clear away from the eyes of the law. A pair 
of tables stand in the center of the room, taking up most of the 
space. The walls are of a dark stone brick which has accumulated 
much dust and dirt. A pair of wall sconces with torches provide 
enough light in the room for someone to see what is occurring, 
yet keeps the place fairly gloomy. 
   To the north, however, the wall has been haphazardly punched 
through, and a tunnel dug into a much gloomier space.

   Flat, diamond-shaped flagstones are laid out across the

either side of the southern gate. A stonework wall encompasses 
this space, built flush with the front corners of the building, 
and rise to about twice the height of an average man in all 
directions except to the east, where the lawn continues. A set 
of clean, limestone stairs leads up to the grand oaken doors of

   A broad, carpeted hallway extends to the north, while a large 
room opens up just to the east. To the west, a narrower hallway

A Hardwood-Floored Landing~
   The floor of this landing is made of polished hardwood and 
warmly lit from small sconces in the northern, western and 
eastern walls. It is wide enough for about five or six men to 
stand shoulder to shoulder. The landing extends from the top of 
the staircase towards a door in the southern wall.

   Sconces set in the east and west walls, above the doors in 
each lend this hallway a cheery, warm light. The hall, made of 
polished hardwood extends from the north to the south from one 
doorway to the other. A mirror hangs on the east wall along with 
several small paintings and other ornaments. The hallway is 
easily wide enough for five or six men to stand abreast of 
eachother.

Winding Alley, East of a Support Bridge~
   This narrow alleyway is situated between the flanks of two 
blackened stone buildings that face the cobbled street to the 
east. The remnants of abandoned stores and stalls dot the roots 
of the building walls, many of their wooden frames scorched by 
flame, or splintered by some great weight. Many of the 
alleyway's cobbles have come loose, though others are in a modest 
condition. The alley slopes down to the east where it joins with 
a wider road, and up to the west, where a shattered gate lends 
sight of a broken bridge.

A Small Kitchen~
   This relatively small room is filled with the prominent smell 
of carmelized sugar and other sweet tasting confections. The 
kitchen is filled with tables, shelves and countertops. The 
walls, floor and ceiling are all built of layered pinewood 
planks. A sturdy door with a large iron lock leads to the road 
to the alley to the south, while a small loft above is accessible

Drab, Dilapidated Storefront~
   A narrow shopfront once invited customers mulling in from the 
busy marketplace. Now though, the pine walls have been marked by 
axe hews and crude blood-stained pictures. Where small glassed 
windows stood in the western wall, now the panes have gone and 
the wind whistles into this place, while the little light that 
does intrude casts uncertain shadows on the tiny opposing door, 
almost invisible under a pile of rubble.

A Large, Freshly-Dug, Ritual Hall~
   This room appears to have been the center of a fortress at one 
time. The hall is filled with ancient pillars which are cracked 
and clearly not part of the original structure. Far beneath the 
ground, the pillars appear to have held up this building even 
when it sunk to ruins below the ground. Since then, the walls 
have been expanded upon and reinforced. Carvings and images of 
snakes, wolves and bats seem to be highly prevalent, and stand 
out amongst the hall. 
   A number of shoddy, worn furnishings dot the room, and someone 
has apparently attempted to stain the walls -- and failed, to an 
extent.

UNUSED Entry Commons to the Lantern Inn~
   A spacious, elegant room unfurls here, the richly stained, 
hardwood floor sparsely dotted with a collection of furniture, 
and accented by a delicate linen rug. The walls are fashioned of 
a dark, chestnut-colored timber, and are left polished and 
un-painted. A pair of rectangular, clear glass windows provide a 
view of the street to the south as well as ample light during the 
day, a series of sconced, bronze lanterns softly illuminating the 
commons at night. The room is almost always partly occupied by a 
number of patrons, adding to its quaint atmosphere.

of a cloth rug, the metallic glint of a row of polished bronze 
sconces to the east, and a collection of furniture set at

A Well-Kept Kitchen~
   This spacious, meticulously maintained kitchen carries a wide 
assortment of equipment and ingredients. The heart of the 
tavern, it clearly is given a great deal of consideration 
regarding its operation and maintenance. The walls hold a 
variety of racks and shelves, and are devoid of any visible 
windows. The smooth, burgundy-hued floorboards are stainless, 
though the thick, umber-painted oaken planks are heavily embedded 
with the scent of hundreds of meals and ales. The counters and 
tables of the kitchen are obviously wiped frequently, and any 
patrons would likely be impressed with the state of this room.

whichever direction one turns, and a set of beds line the walls.

colder than the rest of the tavern. The floorboards above groan 
under the weight of people walking upon them from time to time, 
though a thin stone column with a small ivy pattern engraved on 
it stretches from the smoothed floor to the ceiling, ensuring 
structural integrity. A sturdy door, set in the western wall, 
leads into the brewery.

battle painting vivid northern wall~
This vividly-colored painting shows a large, imposing fortress,
full of vile depictions of orcs, goblins, and other unnamed beasts,
raining arrows upon a force of humans. In the foreground, a human,
clad in full, shimmering platemail, is swinging a massive broadsword
at a particularly nasty leather-wearing orc. On the side of the
fortress, the skies are grey and stormy; on the side of the humans,
they are sunny and clear. The battle is apparently young; neither side
appears to be winning, as yet.

Entrance to a Spiral Staircase~
   This narrow passage way barely offers room for one person. 
The stairs are uneven and scarcely visible in the poorly lit 
corridor. The stairs spiral around what seems to be a large

various poses. Some are perched, while others are in flight. 
The color of all stands out against the grimy grey shade of the 
walls, as a dull blood red.

towers over. Faint noises can be heard below, sounds of ruffling 
echoes and barely audible screeches.

A Wide, Open Cavern~
   This wide, open chasm within the earth is rather large, at 
least fifty feet by thirty feet. What little signs of natural 
life that exist are barely noticeable, but it obviously either is 
the den of many humans or was in the recent past. The walls are 
ensconced in crude torches and battered lamps, casting ample

upper walls.

A Path Leading Away From the Docks~
   This rough path of packed dirt runs in an east to west 
direction, its surface lightly marred with a criss-crossed 
pattern of wagon tracks and footprints. The shoddy road is 
bordered by a thin, rubble-strewn stone wall, beyond which lies a 
sheer drop to the river Anduin. The path curves westward, 
stopping at the door of a large, wood beamed warehouse.

A Spacious Warehouse~
   The room here is open, wide and spacious, the wood-beamed 
walls of the warehouse joining smoothly with a set of polished, 
double doors to the east. A series of bay windows to the west 
overlook the bend of the Anduin, and provide ample light during 
the day. A lit brazier near the center of the room offers warmth 
and light during the often cold hours of the night. The wooden 
floor here is dusty and unkempt, and is littered with crates, 
bags and an assortment of tools.

   This room is open and well-lit, its driftwood floor sparsely 
covered in a thin layer of dirt and dust. The low, domed ceiling 
is supported by a series of thick, cylindrical wooden beams,

at opposite ends of the room, providing warmth and illumination 
during the night. A number of boxes and crates are stacked about

   The warehouse ends abruptly here, a large, windowed wall to 
the north, and the pair of polished log walls to the south and 
west blocking any exit. There is a great deal of activity during 
most hours of the day here - the numerous collections of stained 
wooden crates and metal tools a testemant to the efforts of the 
dockworkers. Carts and their mounts are scattered about this 
section of the warehouse as well, loaded to the brim with various 
supplies.

A Small, Bedchamber Carved from the Rock~
   This small nook in the area is covered with a fine layer of 
rock dust, showing that it has been recently carved and 
constructed. The layout of the room is quite simple, and the 
furnishings sparse. Though one, heavy desk sits in the corner of 
the room. The center of the room is dominated by a large, white 
marble basin that seems to be intensively out of place. The 
basin has been stained a dark red around the edges, almost as if 
it has been washed with blood.

A Cramped Building Alongside the River~
   This musty, open building sits directly alongside the Anduin, 
two bay windows to the west and south revealing a breathtaking 
view of the rushing water beneath the wooden supports of the 
docks. The walls are made entirely of driftwood, the floor 
fashioned out of pine planks smelling lightly of salt and fish. 
A door to the north leads out to the dock's main wharf, a 
smaller, sidedoor to the east leading down to a rusted metal 
rail, and a wooden platform on the river below.

Shadowed Remains of an Ancient Library~
   A high-vaulted ceiling detailed with richly-colored designs 
stretches above, wreckage and ruin all around as the Great Dome's 
collapse shelter a small section of this old remnant of the glory 
of the Kings of Gondor. To the north, recessed into a small apse 
in the wall is a spiral staircase leading to a narrow balcony 
with a large hole offering light during the day high above. The 
floor is ruined by water and rubble. Encased by boulders and 
collapsed walls, this is funnel shaped section of the once great 
Library.

of Osgiliath can be seen, the great Dome of Stars distinct amongst

   Set in the remains of the north wall, this small apse houses a 
spiral staircase. Made from iron and secured only loosely to the

A Hallway through the Fellowships Building~
Stretching both north and south, this vividly crimson-painted
hallway is a constant assailant to the senses. Bright, almost
garish paint floods the view no matter which way one turns;
the smell of cooking food, baking pastries, sawdust, and tanning
leather flood the nostrils as a single conglomerated scent; 
the sound of people chattering and metal-against-metal rings
out from all corners.
  A door to the west is marked with a glob of clay, depicting
the Potters' Fellowship; to the east, a the door is marked
with the candlestick seal of the Chandlers.

A Hallway through the Fellowships Building~
   The hallway here leads four directions. To the north, the 
deep-red-shaded hall moves onward. A beautifully carved, sanded, 
and richly stained archway, engraved with the seal of each and 
every individual Fellowship. To the south lies the dormitory of 
the staff of the building, containing several bunks, chests and 
shelves. Eastward lies a towering circular staircase.

The Common Lounge~
   The walls and ceiling are made up of cedar wood planks stained a rich 
colour, and hewn-stones cover the floor. A small stone fireplace has been 
set against the southern wall, radiating warmth throughout the colder months 
and also creating a cosy atmosphere in the room. A few people can be seen 
here sitting at one of the tables of this medium sized room. Torch sconces 
can be seen on all walls illuminating  the room quite well.
   A thin curtain separates the room to the west, and back to the east,
a stylized wooden archway leads back to the hallway.

The Kitchens~
   Shelves and cupboards cover much of this small rooms wall 
space, while benches and tables take up much of the floor space. 
A stove and fireplace have been built against the western wall, 
giving off quite a bit of heat when in service. Stained cedar 
hardwood makes up the walls and ceiling of this room and 
sewn-stones cover the floor. A small candelabra hangs from the 
ceiling, illuminating much of the room. Some large windows have 
been set into the western wall allowing for both natural light 
and ventilation in this otherwise uncomfortably hot room. 
   A single cedar door sits in the eastern wall, leading back
to the hallway.

The Dormitories~
   This small room is cramped and rather bare. Plain wooden 
bunks line both the eastern and western walls, with a small 
fireplace set against the southern wall, providing ample heat for 
this small area in the colder months. Some torch scones can be 
seen along all walls and provide ample light. The walls and 
ceiling of this room are made of stained cedar wooden planks and 
sewn-stones cover the floor. Few people can be seen in the area, 
mostly at their bunks.

A Large Kitchen~
   An enormous baking oven dominates the northern wall of this 
spacious room. The floor, walls and ceiling are made of smoothly 
sanded and lightly stained pine planks. Tables and counters fill 
the floor space and the walls are lined with an assortment of 
shelves and racks. The mouth-watering aroma of freshly baked 
bread and other tantalizing baked goods fill the room. A sturdy 
door set in the western wall leads out into the shop front.

that lend a cozy feel to the space. A small, tawny-brown woven 
rug covers the pine plank floor and the walls have been painted a 
pleasant shade of pale-blue. A door, set in the western wall,

Usury Office~
   Built solidly of roughly-hewn blocks of granite reinforced 
with mortar and iron rods, this circular room has been built up 
like a small fortress. The narrow windows shaped like arrow 
slits, and the low doorway with the cast-iron door cast a gloomy 
mood upon the crude reddish walls. A large banner, decorated 
with an elaborate rendering of two partially over-lapping golden 
coins, and a green tassle swinging over the coins in a partial 
spiral hangs from an iron pole, attached to the wall. A heavy 
trapdoor with a formidable lock, blocks an exit downward through 
the stone floor while a low, cast-iron door leads out into the 
street.

Narrow Stone Passageway~
   The walls of this narrow passageway are lined with hewn blocks 
of granite, reinforced with mortar and iron rods. The rods 
preventing would be thieves from tunneling in from the outside. 
The walls, ceiling and floor of the passage have been lined with 
iron plating, adding extra reinforcement to allow the passage to 
withstand an explosive blast. Several bronze lanterns are spaced 
along the passageway, lighting the otherwise pitch dark area. 
The area seems eerily devoid of noise as the walls and iron doors 
block any sound from the outside. A reinforced trapdoor leads up 
into the office while a solid iron door provides access to the 
vault.

Crossing of Roads East of the Ruined City Gates~
   A square of black and white cobblestones, many uprooted and 
beaten into the soft earth, joins with a passage through 
crumbling walls to the west. Splintered wood and collapsed stone 
pile up against the city's western defences, while the weathered 
road, once known as Rath Gil, continues to the east. To the 
north and south large piles of rubble have been washed against 
the walls, revealing ols streets stretching away. A set of 
rotting wooden steps to the north of the passage lead high up 
into a crumbling watchtower.

Between Ruins, Along a Worn Road~
   A worn road, formerly known as Rath Gil, stretches on to the 
east and west here, bordered to the north and south by vacated 
buildings of grey stone and rotted wood. The battered husk of a 
larger building still stands to the north, its windows shattered, 
its floors lined with ash and dust. To the south, a huge pile of 
stone rubble pushes against the smashed buildings, as if pushed 
by the last breath of a surge of water. The street is eerily 
quiet.

A Dirty Road, North of a Charred Building~
   The route of a once-resplendent Rath Gil runs east to west 
here, now surrounded by the facades of ruined homes, and 
collapsed, abandoned structures. The black and white 
cobblestones are caked in grime, and have been beaten beneath the 
dirt by some incredible weight. Signs of an old barricade lay to 
the east. An old faded tavern sign has been set against the 
southern ruins, almost obscured by rubble.

Silent Streets, North of an Empty Courtyard~
   Once white-washed buildings, now dirtied and failing with the 
passing of time, line this silent street as it passes from the 
western gates to the fallen dome that lies at the abandoned city 
centre. Underfoot runs a packed dirt road, the earth uneven and 
torn, revealing the occasional basalt or limestone flagstone. An 
intersection of two streets lies to the east, while a destroyed 
palisade has been washed away here, only remnants revealing a 
barricade that once stood here.

An Intersection of Deserted Roads~
   Two roads of a deserted Osgiliath meet here in a sunken 
square, routes leading west, east, south, and north, where the 
fallen masonry of two collapsed buildings bars most passage. The 
few cobblestones that remain within the hard-packed dirt here are 
broken, the flagstones in disarray. The grey ramparts of the 
ghostly quiet city rise above the ruin in all directions, save to 
the east, where the crumbling facade of a large domed structure 
frowns above the roadside.

Before the Remains of the Great Dome~
   Once soaring high above the rooftops of old Osgiliath, the 
dilapidated western flank of the Dome of Stars lies in ruin to 
ahead east. The square blocks of limestone that comprise the 
failing structure have collapsed, blocking entry, with 
precariously jutting remnants of shattered joists and small 
sections of exposed chambers still visible. To the north the 
road is choked with the remains of a fallen tower. 
   Where the old entrance into the Great Dome stood proudly to 
the east, an enormous fresh collapse of roofing and pillars 
reveals the original archway that once held the two large 
doorways that led onwards and eventually to the Great Bridge 
Bel-Iant.

Through the Slums of Osgiliath on Rath Earendil~
   The gentle sounds of the city of Osgiliath fload lazily past 
one's ears here; the quiet steps of passersby upon the dirt road, 
the distant striking of metal, a faint rumbling progress of a 
wagon and other slight noises. Buildings in slum conditions are 
set to either side of the unpaved street of Rath Earendil as it 
leads north and south, little noise emerging from those either. 
The white city walls can be seen afar to the north, and the 
curved top of the Dome of Stars is barely visible above the 
rooftops to the east. An intersection of this street and a 
slightly broader road lies to the south, and a ramshackle shop 
stands just to the east.

North and South on old Rath Earendil~
   The faded street of Rath Earendil leads north and south. 
Named so after a king of Gondor in days long past, there is 
little of the insinuated splendor left upon the street. Clearly 
the scene of battle, every building is shattered and burnt, 
collapsed walls and roofs vie for space with twisted iron 
supports and even boulders. A tiny, shadowy alleyway slinks away 
between its southern edge and the wall of a wooden hut.

A Shattered Vista Bordering Rath Earendil~
   Cropping out of the dirt road of Rath Earendil are the 
fragments and remains of the black and white cobblestones that 
once composed the road. Now cracked and jutting, they heeded 
easy progress. This whole area is a vista of abandoned, 
collapsed buildings and rotting wood. The blackened wall of a 
large, two-story building sits prominently among the buildings to 
the east, and westward, a small alleyway breaks off, leading 
deeper into the ruins.

Junction of Three Roads~
   Three of West Osgiliath's winding dirt roads meet here at a 
brief junction. Rath Cemendur and Rath Earnedil lead west and 
south respectively, while a narrow street seeming more like a 
path through the overhanging derelict buildings leads east. A 
number of cast iron street lamps, long ago succumbed to rust, 
rise up higher than the head of a man here, but no wicks nor 
fresh oil is delivered to them anymore, and as such they cast no 
light out.

Old Rath Cemendur Passes Ruins~
   From east to west the deserted street of Rath Cemendur runs, 
no cobblestones marking its way, instead dirt packed by the tread 
of feet of those who once lived here, guiding the course of the 
road as it runs parallel to the city wall that borders to the 
north. Climbing up from the ruins of age-old buildings to the 
south, charred remains of buildings pile upon each other.

Rath Cemendur Against Collapsing Walls~
   To the south limestone rubble and warped wooden structures lay 
against the remains of buildings that once housed hundreds of the 
poor who lived in the slums here. Opposite them is the towering 
city wall, where spiderwebs of cracks spreading throughout 
several places in the stone. However, one entire section as 
large as a wagon has fallen away to reveal a crack all the way 
through the citywall to Anorien beyond.

Rath Cemendur Leads South into Another Street~
   The unpaved dirt road of Rath Cemendur ends here to the south 
as it meets with another street. Eastward it meanders on, 
running past a row of destroyed housing, a few of the strongest 
looking to be scant inches away from collapsing. The large, 
squared blocks of limestone that comprise the towering city wall 
border the road to the north and west.

Rath Earnil Leads North and West~
   A corner is created in the walls of Osgiliath as the northern 
and western walls meet, indenting slightly before continuing 
their straight set path marking the perimeter of the city. Rath 
Earnil leads by at the base of the decaying battlements, 
following the path dictated by them. Ramshackle shanties built 
from scavenged material border that once packed this dirt street 
are now no more than old ruins of stone and rotting timbers. 
Northwards Rath Earnil ends, becoming Rath Cemendur as the dirt 
road leads east to west by the wall.

A Turn East to South on Rath Earnil~
   The normal straight progression of Rath Earnil is forced to 
shift here as the Osgiliath city wall turns from the east to the 
south here. Set in perpetual twilight during the day due to the 
passage of the ivy-strewn wall, and near pitch blackness at 
night, the street here is not made of cobblestones, instead 
composed of hard-packed dirt that quickly turns to mud in wet 
weather.

Rath Earnil Leads North and South by the City Wall~
   The gloom of dusk comes early to the street of old Rath 
Earnil, brought upon by the twenty-foot high white stone wall 
that rises up from the packed dirt of the road to the west. The 
occasional odd cobblestone pokes out underfoot in the street, 
varying in make from limestone to basalt, and often tripping the 
unwary. Bordering the street on the east is a row of decaying 
buildings built from scrap wood, climbing upward from age-old 
stone remains just visible beneath and around them. A single, 
sumptuous house of stone rises up amongst them, its roof caved in 
by a large boulder.

Rath Earnil North of an Intersection~
   What was once Rath Earnil winds north and south alongside the 
limestone city wall that lies to the west, taking its name after 
one of the many ancient Kings of Gondor, that line now passed 
with the Stewards ruling in their place. This section of the 
blasted city of Osgiliath has collapsed and crumbled after the 
sieges, with many of the buildings bordering the eastern side of 
the street in near ruin, or nothing more then an ancient heap of 
rock, some so old that vines have begun to snake through the 
rubble. An old footpath leads through the remains of one such 
collapsed building, winding deeper into the wreckage. To the 
west, a large charred archway opens into the base of a guard 
tower, and progress south leads to a crossing of rubbled streets.

Approaching an Intersection to the North on Rath Earnil~
   Rath Earnil used to lead directly to the south from here, 
following the straight limestone walls of the city. Now it is a 
more ragged affair, with rubble and fired husks of building 
crowding the trail. White and black cobblestones laid down over 
the area are cracked and mostly obscured by dust and rubble. The 
street here quickly sheds its cobbles for packed dirt, which 
turns to a muddy mess during wet weather. To the west a wide 
stone archway once led into the base of a tower that juts up from 
the city walls, but now it is collapsed and useless.

Rath Earnil Beneath Damaged Battlements~
   Large blocks of grainy white limestone squared off to near 
perfection are placed atop of each other to form a towering wall 
that lies to the west, more than four times the height of the 
tallest man. Though still mighty in terms of height and width, 
sheer and deep cracks in the wall are clearly visible from the 
dirt street of old Rath Earnil that runs at the base of it as it 
heads north and south. Watermarks stain the limestone at least 
six feet above the ground, perhaps more.

Rath Earnil Turns North and East With the Wall~
   The narrow dirt road of Rath Earnil, squeezes between the 
tottering city walls that lie to the west and south as they turn 
here and the collection of old ransacked and collpasing dwellings 
opposite the limestone structure. An oppressive silence lingers 
here, heavy with the history of the once mighty capital of the 
nation of Gondor, broken by the occasional burst of sound to the 
west over the walls from those few still dwelling close to the 
city in Anorien.

here, so do the ancient streets of Rath Earnil and Rath Anardil. 
Both are littered with the fragmented remains of black and white 
cobblestones, and they lead to the south and to the west in a 
near perpetual gloom during the day, the shadow cast over them 
projected by the towering stone blocks of the city wall. Burnt 
out shanties extend southwards.

Fire-Destroyed Rath Arnadil~
   Once Rath Anardil, so named in honour of one of the many past 
kings of Gondor, is now nothing more then a road of dirt and 
often mud that runs at the base of the southern city wall of 
Osgiliath. It narrows slightly as it heads to the east here 
before turning off to the north where it merges with another 
street, the edges pushed closer together by the row of 
fire-wrecked dilapidated and decrepit buildings that scrabble up 
from the ground on the north side of the road. This whole area 
has been destroyed by fire.

Rath Anardil Runs East and West~
   A very slight upwards climb can be observed here on the street 
of Rath Anardil as it heads further eastwards, the reverse being 
true to those who progress to the west. The dirt street is 
mainly free of trash or debris, most of it having been kicked 
aside into small piles cluttered against the walls of the 
run-down huts that form a ragged border to the north. The 
occasional shout or voice is audible from among the housing in 
this area of western Osgiliath, but for the main part, a calm, 
quiet atmosphere hangs heavy in the air.

Rath Anardil Alongside the City Wall~
   This stretch of old Rath Anardil runs the east to west in a 
straight course, its road composed of remnants of burnt timbers 
and worse, under which the occasional odd broken flagstone can be 
seen. On the northern edge of the road runs a row of double 
story houses, all of which are gutted by fire. Opposite the 
houses is the southern wall of the city of Osgiliath, rising 
twenty feet high in the air and constructed from squared blocks 
of white, grainy limestone, all of which are daubed in fading 
crude carvings and daubed representations of slaughter and abuse.

A Junction of Ancient Roads~
   Two streets meet here at the base of the tall grey wall that 
marks the southern border of the former city of Osgiliath. The 
latter road branches out to the north, cutting through decrepit 
buildings and swaths of rubble. Another snakes eastward, the 
hard dirt pathway bordered by abandoned homes and headless 
statues, the street devoid of any signs of life. Farther to the 
east the Anduin river can be seen, the road beginning a slow turn 
toward burnt piers and a ravaged dockyard.

Quiet Road by a Junction to the South~
   An eerie silence has settled over the southern stretch of this 
black-cobbled street as it nears ramparts in the distance. The 
pounding of hooves and the grinding of wheels have left the 
street uneven and difficult to traverse, brackish water at times 
collecting in the potholes that mark the roadway. To the south, 
towering above the ruin of dilapidated houses and storefronts, a 
grey wall rises, its northern face blanketed in moss and its 
roots blackened with soot. An alleyway to the west has been 
blocked by the fall of a pair of stone and wooden structures, 
while to the east sits the face of an abandoned shopfront, 
miraculously spared.

Between Burnt Buildings, on a Black-Cobbled Road~
   Bordering the irregularly paved, black-cobbled street as it 
cuts a path north and south through the western wing of this 
ghost city are ancient wooden buildings, their surfaces scorched 
and swept with soot. Blackened flagstones constitute the 
majority of the roadway. To the west a stone shopfront stands 
shakily, its southern side collapsed, and reduced to a trail of 
rubble. A narrow alleyway cuts a path toward the Anduin to the 
east, barely visible through the ruin. Southwards the road 
continues haphazardly.

buildings on all sides, like maws. A narrow alleyway cuts a path 
toward the Anduin to the east, barely visible through the ruin. 
Southwards the road continues haphazardly. Torch and lantern 
light do little to illuminate this cramped street.

A Black-Cobbled Road, South of an Intersection~
   An array of cobblestones, blackened with soot and grime, lie 
in a dirt road once known as Rath Earendil as it leads north and 
south through the western wing of a neglected Osgiliath. 
Potholes and debris riddle the street, the flagstones of the 
roadside obscured in some places and battered in others. 
   To the west a dilapidated courtyard has been ripped apart by 
rising flagstones and falling rubble from the collapsed manse 
beyond. Entire sections of buildings have been thrown over what 
was once a section of iron railings.

   An array of cobblestones, blackened with soot and grime, lie 
in a dirt road. Potholes and debris riddle the street, the 
flagstones of the roadside obscured in some places and battered 
in others. A row of lampposts run parallel to the black-cobbled 
road, a few lit now to illuminate in dull pools the path north 
and south. Little can be seen, but a faint sound of scratching 
and the occasional call of a night creature can be heard. There 
is a strange feeling to this place, as though each breeze is a 
passing citizen of this once-glorious city.

Approaching Portcullis, Along a Gloomy Road~
   On the northern side of this dark and gloomy street lies a row 
of townhouses, their once whitewashed faces now darkened and 
scarred with the markings of war. Other houses in the region 
have collapsed into a pile of timbers, many splintered and 
half-consumed by flame. Overturned wagons and cracked rubble now 
lies where people once walked, creating a weaving clear pathway 
to follow. To the south a wall rises, the ramparts devoid of 
banners and missing large swaths of crenellation. To the east 
the road bends, ending at a large portcullis.

North of a Sturdy Wooden Portcullis~
   A beaten dirt street ends to the east here, where a slivered 
stone railing marks the edge of a massive cliff to the east. Far 
below the husk of a burnt warehouse can be spied, ashes mingling 
with the water of the Anduin. On clear days the distant eastern 
wing of the ghost city can be spied across the river, the 
buildings on the far horizon forming a wasteland of ancient 
stone. Bridges span the Anduin's breadth, all of them fallen 
through, their foundations shattered. A twisted portcullis lies 
to the south, the road running under it, and into the the 
remnants of the Osgiliath dockyard.

A Bleak Passageway Through a Wall~
   Blackened limestone lies in all directions, comprising the 
arch that lifts this section of the southern city wall, as well 
as the flat flagstone that forms the roadway. Iron torch sconces 
that once lit this bleak passageway have now rusted, many blasted 
from their hinges. To the north sits a broken and twisted 
portcullis, its frame almost useless. To the south sits another 
exit, once blocked by a gate which has since been destroyed, the 
road in that direction leading down to a deserted dockyard.

A Path Leading to a Deserted Dockyard~
   Two tattered banners, their colours faded, hang from a pair of 
rusted iron posts set into the wall on either side of the 
passageway to the north. A black-cobbled road leads southward on 
a steep, winding path down the Anduin cliffside, meeting an 
abandoned dockyard to the distant southeast. The river bends 
slightly westward to the south, and the opposite side can be seen 
on clear days, though it is little more than a hazy purple line. 
A stone wall borders the cliffside to the east and south, moss 
blanketing the crumbling foundations. A section of the northern 
wall has caved in, revealing a large pipe which twists facing 
eastwards.

Dirt Path to the East of a Junction~
   Large, derelict double-story buildings loom up menacingly over 
this thin dirt path as it leads east and west. Perhaps once 
bustling warehouses full of goods and laborers, now they stand 
abandoned, their dark wooden walls contrasting bleakly against 
the limestone city wall that rises up to the north behind them. 
A still silence holds over this area here, the only sounds being 
the footsteps of those who wander through this deserted section 
of Osgiliath. A junction lies to the west, while to the east, 
white stone rubble is piled up into a large mound.

Atop a Mound of Ancient Stone Rubble~
   Shifting treacherously underfoot here is a loose collection of 
rubble and waste. Composed mostly of broken blocks of limestone 
in all shapes and sizes, fragments of wooden beams, pieces of 
pottery and shards of glass all feature throughout, an edged 
hazard to the bare foot. Soot and ash have fallen in the deeper 
cracks of the mound, rising perhaps half a dozen feet above the 
level of a narrow dirt trail that slinks around it branching off 
to the east, west, and south. The corner of a whitewashed 
building borders against the mound to the southwest, while the 
towering city wall stands firmly to the north.

A Fire-Scorched Clearing~
   Twisting a crooked course through black-charred masonry and 
timber, this is barely more than a clamber. Collapsed walls lie 
to either side. A huge building, once constructed of stone, now 
resides only as a mound of rubble nearby. A huge pile of charred 
skeletons, humanoid if the clutching bony fingers and collar 
bones are anything to go by rises ahead twice as tall as a normal 
human and stretches to fill the whole area. Some skeletal 
remains are small, perhaps children or other creatures. Other 
can be seen bearing fused charred helms to their skulls. Here 
and there black cloth reveals the insignia of the old Vanguard. 
The charnel heap blocks out all light amidst the remnants of 
walls and old buildings.

   This somewhat narrow wooden dockway is extremely sturdy

It is still plenty large enough for a cart to come and go, and it 
leads up to the broad entryway of a large, wood-beamed warehouse,

white, somewhat startling against the rest of the drab, 
wood-toned structures nearby.

brackish water of the river.

A Spacious, Crowded Wooden Dock Over the River Anduin~
   Huge and comprised of thick, sturdy wooden planks that have 
been worn to a greyish shade through weather and time, these 
docks stretch out for quite a ways over the blue-green waters of 
the river Anduin. This area is open but crowded, a press of 
merchants, sailors, hawkers and citizens flowing slowly past in
all directions toward other parts of the docks. The white sails 
and complicated riggings of ships can often be seen at the ends 
of the docks where one has berthed, visible beyond the rooftops
of various buildings and warehouses. Shouts and clamor fill the
air at all times of day, lanterns flickering on tall wooden poles 
to light the area at night.

and white sails, as well as barges, dinghies, and other water 
craft can be seen all over the place, tied up at the ends of 
dockwalks or gliding past in the waters. The stout wooden piers 
rise up at the edges of the docks, stained with seagull droppings 
and, closer to the waters, barnacles. A wooden hut rises up to 
the west, a trickle of people wandering in and out of the planked 
door that provides access, and the docks stretch on to the north.

   An evenly applied coat of sky blue paint has been placed over

declaration for all goods entering and leaving the docks of 
Osgiliath. Due to this, a small crowd of merchants and ship 
captains can be found here at all times of night and day eager to 
announce their cargo and be on their business. A number of

walls of the office here, and some comfortable pieces of 
furniture have been placed here so that those forced to wait do 
not have to necessarily carry through in discomfort.

for sale, and a number of cluttered shelves line the walls. Some

A Spacious Wooden Dock Near A Warehouse~
   Oak planks have been laid down over larger beams to form the 
wooden boardwalk of the Osgiliath Docks, built at the base of a 
towering cliffside, atop which are the limestone walls of the 
city itself. A wide roadway is visible in the distance to the 
east as it climbs up the slope, and the docks themselves sprawl 
out to the east and south. Held above the waters of the River 
Anduin, activity is never far away on the docks, with barges and 
other river craft tying up and casting off, bringing goods to and 
from the city for trade along other cities located along the 
river. A crowd of sailors, merchants, and citizens pass through 
this area, going about their business, and the occasional 
patrolman strolls by, helping to keep the peace. A large 
warehouse stands up against the cliffside to the north.

A Sturdy Wooden Boardwalk Running East to West~
   Worn to a greyish hue due to weather and time, this thickly 
planked, sturdy dockway leads eastward across the dark blue-green 
waters of the river Anduin, opening westward into a much larger 
area, though just as crowded as this one with a constant flow of 
dockworkers and sailors, as well as merchants, citizens, and the 
occasional patrolman. Busy at all times of day, the area is kept 
lit at night by lanterns bolted to the stout wooden piers that 
line the walk to the south.

A Sturdy, Crowded Wooden Boardwalk~
   Over time, the thick, sturdy planks of this boardwalk have 
been worn to a greyish hue, but are no less strong. Broad enough 
for wagons and carts to pass by with little trouble, the dock 
stretches east to west across the waters of the river Anduin, 
bordered on the north by small wooden shanties, and crowded with 
a constant flow of dockworkers and sailors, as well as merchants, 
citizens, and the occasional patrolman. Busy at all times of 
day, the area is kept lit at night by lanterns bolted to the 
stout wooden piers that line the walk to the south.

A Huge, Busy Wooden Dockway~
   Thick, sturdy planks have been used to construct this 
expansive dockway, which feels nonetheless rather crowded with 
the constant flow of people wandering by, ranging from sailors to 
merchants and the occasional patrolman. The wood underfoot is 
weathered by time and use but is still plenty strong enough to 
support the weight of the carts and wagons that occasionally 
rumble past, taking their cargo to the various warehouses among 
the docks, or to the ships and barges prepared to transport it. 
Wooden huts and huge warehouses are crammed against each other to 
the north and south, a long wooden walkway extending eastward 
over the rushing, dark waters of the Anduin River.

Well Organised Floor Of A Warehouse~
   This expansive, open warehouse sees a brisk traffic of large 
crates in and out of the large double-doors that sit to the 
south, men of sober clothing and large build moving in and out of 
the warehouse playing their part in the bustling river trade of 
the Osgiliath wharves. The stream of men are pushed aside by the 
occasional wagon or cart, and a number of somewhat more 
well-dressed men move throughout the wide floors yelling at the 
labourers and teamsters. All this hustle and bustles occurs over 
the spartan wooden floor and between the plain wooden walls, both 
appearing of recent construct by the unmellowed wood. A large 
door leads north, the occasional box moving in and out of the 
area that lies beyond it.

Cluttered Office And Living Quarters~
   Countless empty crates, barrels and boxes rest in stacks 
coated lightly with dust and cobwebs, taking up the corners and 
edges of this room, snatching the already small space and 
creating a clutter. Set in the middle of the room amongst the 
boxes is a series of desks, each covered in parchments, and to 
the northern side of the room a small living space has been 
carved out from the reign of the crates. To the south, a small 
door is just visible, the boxes shoved to either side to allow 
passage through it.

Dank, Dismal Cellar Of Stone~
   This large cellar has been constructed of stone, and at some 
years passed if the thick layer of moss wedged between the grey 
stones in any indication of the passing time this basement has 
stood for. Little fresh air stirs here, instead a dank, musty 
aroma hangs over the area, coupled with the scent of old sweat. 
Dark stains mark the stone walls and floor of this underground 
chamber, and many boxes and barrels, of all descriptions and 
sizes, lay about the area, a large pile of crates set at the 
northern wall. Leading upwards across the eastern wall in a 
ramp, ascending at a gentle curve to aid in moving between the 
dismal cellar and the trapdoor in the ceiling.

A Long, Weathered Wooden Dock~
   Narrower than the huge, crowded expanse of dockway that lies 
just to the west, this planked walkway is still wide enough for a 
cart or wagon to travel without much difficulty, and occasionally 
the crowds of sailors, merchants, and citizens part for one to do 
just that. Ships and barges dock often toward the ends of this 
walkway, their riggings clearly visible against the dark 
blue-green backdrop of the wide Anduin River that flows north and 
south, stretching eastward almost as far as the eye can see. On 
clear days, the purplish outline of the opposite shore is 
visible, and the impressive arch of the Bele-Iant is clearly seen 
in the air to the north.

A Weathered Wooden Dock Crowded With People~
   Stretching for some distance east and west, this planked 
wooden walkway is made of heavy, thick lumber that has faded to a 
greyish brown due to time and weather, splattered here and there 
with seagull droppings. The impressive sweep of the Anduin's 
deep blue-green waters extends for as far as the eye can see to 
the north and south, the dim purplish line of the opposite shore 
visible to the east, across the river. The stone arch of the 
Bele-Iant can be clearly viewed from here, straddling the waters, 
as well as the grand structure of the Star Dome itself, to either 
side of the covered bridge.

The End Of A Weathered Wooden Dockway~
   The sturdy, thickly-planked wooden dock ends here, bordered by 
stout, round piers that are often splattered with bird droppings. 
Huge sailboats or barges are often seen lashed up to either side, 
sailors moving busily up and down the planks to transport crates 
and boxes and barrels of cargo. The view, when not obscured by 
the masses of rigging and the fluttering white sails of ships, is 
expansive, providing a clear look at the rushing river Anduin as 
it flows swiftly from north to south. Far across the blue-green 
waters, the opposite shore is visible as a smudge of 
purplish-green, and the greyish line of the city's limestone 
walls is just able to be glimpsed. The Star Dome itself 
straddles either side of the impressive Bele-Iant, a covered 
bridge that arches across the river to connect the two sides of 
the city of Osgiliath.

A Decrepit Houseboat Reeking of Fish~
   Long since sea-worthy, this houseboat has been permanently 
moored to the dockside by way of several ropes and a sturdy 
wooden plank. It bobs gently in the water, a narrow rim around 
the outside of the boat providing space to stand on and gaze out 
over the river. A railing keeps careless people from slipping 
off, its wooden boards about waist-height. The rest of the boat 
is a large building, one end open to the elements and customers, 
and a trapdoor sits in the floor, presumably leading into the 
boat's hold below. The air reeks of fish, both fresh and old, 
the occasional breeze doing little to dispell it.

planked wooden dockway remains sturdy enough to easily support 
the weight of the piles of crates and barrels that are often 
stacked upon it, as well as the passage of the various carts and 
wagons travelling through. It gives an orderly, sharp turn 
southward, barges or sailing ships often docking to the east, 
lashing themselves with rope to the thick, sturdy piers. The 
waters of the Anduin rush downriver from north to south, 
stretching out almost far as the eye can see, and to the north 
across the waters, another sprawling section of the Osgiliath 
docks is visible, when the light is good and the weather clear. 
Far off to the east, a smudge of purplish-green marks the 
opposite shore of the river.

   White paint has liberally been applied to this wide wharf as 
it leads off over the dark waters of the River Anduin and off the 
docks of Osgiliath that lie to the north. A slight flow of river 
traffic casts off and ties up to the various beams of its length, 
sailors and merchants clustering about the docks hauling and 
checking away at the cargo the small river craft of the Anduin 
ferry back and forth across its waters. To the south is a 
planked wooden building constructed right onto the end of the 
wharf, a weather-beaten door providing access.

two bay windows to the west and south revealing a breathtaking 
view of the rushing water beneath the wooden supports of the 
docks. The walls are made entirely of driftwood, the floor 
fashioned out of pine planks smelling lightly of salt and fish. 
A door to the north leads out to the dock's wooden wharf, a 
smaller, sidedoor to the east leading down to a rusted metal 
rail, and a wooden platform on the river below.

A Winding, Cobbled Road Along a Steeply Slanted Slope~
   This wide, cobbled road slopes steeply, but not too much for 
the carts and wagons that occasionally rumble past, going between 
the city and the expansive wooden docks visible off to the east. 
Straggly greyish-green grass sprouts to either side of the road, 
with a few trees clinging stubbornly to the reddish slope, their 
roots plunging deep into the rocky earth. The white-stoned road 
itself bends eastward toward the city wall visible far above, and 
further southward, slanting down closer to the docks.

from the docks visible just to the east, chopped out a steep 
cliffside, a few trees and sparse grasses stubbornly thriving 
along the edges of the road itself. The road is still passable, 
though somewhat laborious, for wagons and carts, a few of which 
rumble by occasionally with their loads of goods, moving between 
the city far above and the sprawling, wooden docks that stretch 
over the rushing waters of the river Anduin.

   This planked wooden dock was obviously constructed many, many 
years ago, the colors of the wood greyed and weathered over time. 
However, it is still sturdy underfoot, creaking only a little as 
wagons and carts rumble past, along with a throng of sailors and 
citizens going about their business here. The docks sprawl out 
for quite a ways to the east, stretching far over the rushing 
blue-green waters of the Anduin River. Southward, a large 
warehouse is just visible over the crowds of people, and various 
other buildings jut up from the wide dockways off to the east.

   Black and white cobblestones have been laid down over the dirt 
to form this large swath of market square, the ground upon they 
are placed upon still visible in the form of potholes and missing 
stones. The normal subdued murmur of western Osgiliath is shed 
with the hustle and bustle of the market here, farmers and 
peddlers shouting out the qualities of their wares on display 
from numerous stalls, wagons, tents or simply carried about on a 
tray. The market continues to the east and south, while the 
streets of the city lay in all other directions.

   This old shop is quite rundown and shows only recent signs of 
being rather poorly remodeled. Row upon row of old wooden 
planking showing numerous nicks and scars bereft of any windows 
gives this place a certain claustrophobic feel, and the pure 
clutter throughout the room does little to help deter this image. 
The floor is made of equally old planking which tends to groan 
when too much weight is put on it. Old burn scar marks are also 
revealed hinting that a fire may have been the cause for this 
store's remodeling. The shelves, racks, and spindly tables are 
piled high with various knick-knacks, stacks of clothing, and 
various odds and ends of all sorts, leaving very little 
floor-space to maneuver about.

Shelves are bare and the counter is marked deeply with gouges

   Eliptical in shape, this room has no corners to speak of, 
rather soft, gentle curves. The smooth, wood-panelled walls are 
painted a warm umber brown, lending the room an earthy feel. In 
many places the elements have faded and stained the panels near 
the windows. Underfoot, the cold stone shows many narrow scrape 
marks. The windows in the western wall give light during the 
daytime, especially at sunset, though they are bare of glass. 
The earthen-coloured walls are interrupted only by a pair of 
doors: one due west, the other due east. This room is in good 
repair compared to the city ruins outside.

backs to this alley, forming a tightly-packed border blocking any

still some fragments of the original cobbles stick at odd angles. 
Ramshackle huts built from scrap material and the gutted remains

   This meandering alley is little more than a gap between two 
decrepit stone buildings, making it a slight squeeze for more 
than a couple humanoids to move through at a time. The dirt path 
is made even more precarious by the small boulders scattered 
across it, the obstacles crushing walls of nearby buildings and 
sitting amidst a shattered roof.

A Small Dirt Square Surrounded by Fire-Scorched Hovels~
   The narrow dirt alleys widen here into a small, squarish 
opening between a few toppled buildings to the north and a tall, 
crumbling stone wall to the south. The ground has been packed 
over time by footsteps until it is nearly as hard as stone, 
softening only slightly when it rains. The sky is more visible 
in this area, a change from the mere sliver visible when moving 
through the cramped passageways of this fire-swept area of 
Osgiliath. The way narrows once more to the east and west, and a 
thin wooden door sits to the north, daubed with crude pictures of 
atrocities.

A Knife-Edged Twist in a Narrow Alleyway~
   Stretching out from a narrow square to the east, this cramped 
dirt pathway takes a sharp twist around the stone corner of a 
shell of a warehouse to the southeast, hemmed in to the north and 
west by the rubbled hulks of ancient buildings. The way widens 
slightly to the south, opening up between the warehouse wall and 
another hovel.

   The crooked dirt trail splits off around the corner of a 
caved-in building to the southwest, snaking its way through the 
clustered deserted houses. To the east, tall, crumbling stone 
wall of a warehouse borders the pathway, trampled weeds poking up 
occasionally at the base of the building. The narrow alleyway 
slinks on to the north, south, or west.

   The cold, crumbling stone wall of a tall warehouse to the east 
casts a shadow over this narrow space between that building and a 
large pile of charred timbers to the west. The trail itself is 
simply packed dirt, strewn with rounded pebbles. It runs 
directly north and south, where it widens a bit. A mere sliver 
of sky is visible overhead, just beyond the rooftops of the 
closely cramped buildings.

A Short Alleyway Splitting off an Intersection to the East~
   Extending only a short way to the west, this alley comes to an 
abrupt dead end, sandwiched between tall, rundown shacks. 
Battered doorways stand to the west and south, the other 
buildings choosing to turn their backs on this decrepit little 
slice of alleway. The ground underfoot is merely packed dirt, 
bits of refuse and scraps of various unidentifiable items 
scattered about here and there. Rats and mangy alley animals 
skulk about in the shadows, the gleam of eyes visible 
occasionally here and there.

A Shabby First Floor~
   Though spacious, this first story has obviously led a hard 
life. The walls are of horizontal wooden timbers, which are old 
and painted a dull, dirty white where they are not missing 
entirely. The floor is entirely composed of stained dark-red 
timbers, which look to be recently replaced for some reason or 
another. Wherever one happens to step, the boards creak softly 
beneath the foot, though they are not rickety by any means. The 
eastern wall bears a faded, tattered, and worn tapestry, whose 
lower right corner seems to have been burned away a little. The 
northern wall bears a window, and the western, a staircase 
leading to the cellar. The room smells faintly, no matter what 
time of day or what weather, of jasmine and lavender, though more 
pungent scents occasionally waft in from outside.

A Decrepit Lot~
   The remains of some rickety splintered building are scattered 
about the stonework foundation, long ruined since it was erected 
in some bygone age. The southern wall has collapsed, a path 
through the rubble available to those who tread carefully. It is 
impossible to see beyond, as the stonework and timbers lay well 
over the height of a building.

A Cramped Lobby~
   This lobby is small and damp, moss clinging to the cracks in 
the dull-grey stones that compose its walls. The room smells 
musty and the air is humid and still. The tiled floor is the one 
redeeming feature in this cramped area. Small red and white clay 
tiles have been set into the floor to form a chequered mosaic. 
Each of the lobby walls possesses a large battered-wooden door. 
The doors to the left and right were once brightly painted but 
now the paint is dull and in places flakes, leaving the bare wood 
visible. There is a narrow wooden staircase leading upwards just 
past the western door, a couple of balusters missing from it.

   This tiny alleyway seems almost accidental, but is wide enough 
for a couple of people to walk abreast. A small opening lends 
passage to the north. The old road of Rath Earendil is visible

splits here, widening considerably before the entrance of an 
immense, once-grand stone building to the south that has now 
fallen into a state of near collapse. The ground is packed dirt 
mingled with unsavory and mostly unidentifiable remnants. The 
way narrows to the west, and a dirt alley slinks off into the 
shadows to the north. Eastwards a building has collapsed.

stone wall of the Star Dome, the roof of which rises majestically 
above the squalor and filth the slums. The moldy stone wall of a 
towering, perhaps once-grand mansion lies to the south, and on 
the opposite side of the alley, a narrow, splintery wooden door 
sits between this area and the interior of a shack, which is 
built of faded wooden planks.

   This narrow dirt pathway wends north through the remains of 
warehouses, and southward it widens slightly into a small 
intersection. Any gust of wind causes shutters to bang and 
rickety wooden walls to creak. Shadowy even during the brightest 
day, this alley is pitch dark at night-time. 
   Above, two walls meet, leaning against each other 
precariously.

   Light has difficulty reaching this narrow pathway that winds 
drunkenly through the blackened arches and swaying walls, twists 
and bends marking the areas where it squeezes past this destroyed 
section of Osgiliath. Nevertheless, it meanders mainly north to 
south, trash ground into the packed dirt underfoot. 
   A lone boulder lays in the middle of the alley, nearly 
blocking it. Fish skeletons lay beneath it.

occasional breeze of fresher air drifts in from the east.

A Sharply Twisting Alleyway Bordering a Cliffside~
   This section of alleyway seems a bit more open than the rest 
of the city here, by virtue of the stunning view over a cliffside 
that provides a sharp and deadly-looking drop to the east. 
Remains of a wooden fence provide dubious protection against 
those who would wander too close. The waters of the Anduin lie 
far below, and in the hazy distance, the opposite shore can be 
glimpsed on clear days. The once grand structure of the Star 
Dome is no more than rubble to the southeast, and the Great 
Bridge of the Bele-Iant is now mere columns and wreckage, a great 
ship laying on its side on the southern side near the western 
bank. The alley itself, dingy and cramped compared to the vast 
view over the cliffside, continues north and westward. 
   Surprisingly, looking over the edge of the cliff, it is clear 
that a high volume of water has passed here, as a small boat has 
been lodged halfway up amidst boulders leaving gouges in the soil 
below them.

An Alleyway Squeezing Between Collapsed Buildings and the City Wall~
   The thick city wall towers up to the east, crumbling and in 
many places cracked and holed, bearing a watermark well above the 
height of a man. It ends somewhat abruptly to the south, where 
the alleyway seems to open up a bit, fresher air wafting in 
occasionally. The pathway continues on its narrow way to the 
north and south, crumbled and destroyed stone dwellings making it 
impossible to move to the west. Underfoot is little but packed 
dirt, a few scraggly weeds sprouting up off to the sides. The 
Anduin can be heard roaring some way below to the east.

   This large warehouse has all kinds of industrial supplies in

The floor is covered in sawdust, and the air smells strongly of 
leather and wood. The ceiling of the warehouse is quite high, 
with small, squat windows to let in light and air near the top of 
the walls. The walls themselves are bare wood, growing grey with 
age. A large area to the west contains a mill.

would once have been the back walls of buildings, but is now 
simply abandoned wreckage of past lives, to lead further away 
from the deserted road of Rath Earnil. To the east, it twists a 
bit around corners of walls and collapsed rooftops, but stays 
relatively straight as it leads deeper into the darkened alley. 
A door to the south provides access to a small building, 
seemingly unharmed by fire.

white-stone buildings that now serve as little more than a 
reminder of the dead glory of Osgiliath. The ground seems to 
have once been cobblestone, but is now packed dirt, with only a 
few rocks scattered about here and there. The smell of refuse

of the close, cramped quarters and sub-par housing. A few people 
in raggedy clothes wander through occasionally, most visible in

meanders along, cast into shadow for much of the day by the 
crumbling stone and wood townhouses that line it. The quiet 
sounds of people drift by occasionally, especially off to the 
south, and now and then a door slams, or a voice calls out.

the south and west. The ground underfoot is little more than 
packed dirt, though a few cobblestones peek through here and

rats and mangy alley creatures are a common sight, adding to the 
already unsavory atmosphere of the Osgiliath slums.

   This small hut has walls made of planked wood, hardy and 
nailed securely together with few gaps, but left unpainted and 
unstained. The ceiling is relatively high, and a small wooden 
ladder leads to a hatch above, presumably the living quarters of 
this shopkeep. The heavy scent of herbs, incense and medicinal 
remedies fills this shop, assaulting the senses immediately upon 
walking through the door, though it is arguably more pleasant 
than the stench of the slums beyond. Dimly lit by several 
torches within beaten brass sconces, the room has a cluttered, 
cozy atmosphere, satchets of herbs strewn over tables and 
countertops, and bunches of dried flowers hang from the ceiling.

   This building is rather spacious and some care has gone into 
keeping it neat, as the floors are kept mostly free of dirt and 
debris. The windows set in the northern wall to either side of 
the doorway look out upon a small, shaded dirt square. Movement 
thorugh the shop itself is cramped by several tables, piles of 
folded clothing, accessories, footwear, and other second-hand 
goods heaped thickly atop them all. Battered bronze lanterns are 
mounted on the walls, providing soft, flickering illumination to 
the shop during night and day. A counter stretches out across 
the back of the room, and behind its nicked surface, a metal 
ladder leads up toward a trapdoor in the ceiling.

   The odour of stale beer greets you as you enter this small,

leaking barrel or cask, is strewn about the floor. Circular 
stains marr the floorboards where rows of casks and barrels used

flat surfaces in the room. A barred window allows daylight to 
sneak in and brighten the room, while a reinforced door set in

UNUSED The Market Glassworks~
   This lively shop is the lower level of a two-story home. The 
walls and ceiling are newly built wood, stained a light golden 
color and still in very good shape. The floor is made up of 
alternating grey and blue tiles, a large, brightly patterned 
throw-rug just before the door providing a place for customers to 
wipe their feet. Several shelves and display cases are mounted 
on the walls throughout the store, each filled with bottles jars, 
goblets, plates, and other objects, as well as vibrantly colored 
works of art. Traffic through here is nearly continuous, and the 
noise level can get a little loud sometimes.

UNUSED A Well-Furnished Workroom~
   Well-furnished but not lavishly so, this rather spacious 
backroom of the shop appears to be more geared toward working 
than, for example, for inviting company over. A large window set 
into the eastern wall peeks out a few feet before the view is 
interrupted by a wooden-walled building. A staircase runs along 
the northern wall, snaking its way upstairs, a second staircase 
leading downward beneath the first. A simple door sporting a 
fairly shiny lock leads westward to the shopfront.

A Dirt Alley Twisting Into A Narrow Path~
   Leaving behind the darkened street to the west, this narrow 
pathway eases between closely huddled charred buildings to slink 
deeper into decaying and decrepit housing. The dirt alley is 
relatively clear underfoot, most of the debris washed away or 
pushed against the walls by force of water. Shadows sprawl 
across the area even at the height of day, and murky darkness 
descends early in the evening, lending it a rather dangerous, 
unsafe feel at most times. It widens very slightly to the north.

A Sharp Turn in a Dirt Alleyway~
   This alleyway runs south and east, taking a knife-edged turn 
around the corner of a building to the south. Bordering the 
northern way is a disheveled wooden house. Underfoot is packed 
dirt mingled with refuse, and above is a narrow sliver of sky, 
the rooftops of the slums resembling nothing so much as jagged 
teeth attempting to swallow what little light remains. The way 
widens off to the east, beyond some closely clustered shanties.

A Dirty Alley Slipping East and West~
   Tthe packed dirt of this alleyway is mingled profusely with 
rubble and wreckage that has been washed ashore from the flooded 
Anduin recently. The stench and thick air weighs heavily on the 
senses, and rats are often seen scurrying about among the heaps. 
To the east and west, the pathway continues to snake its way 
through the dark alleys. Northward, a large wood-framed archway 
allows access into an open-air yard.

A Small Intersection of Dirt Pathways~
   Splitting off in all directions save for the south, this 
intersection is a bit wider than the crooked alleways that extend 
away from it. It is covered in wreckage from the river. A tall 
wooden building has collapsed to the south and is no more than a 
burnt out shell. Decrepit housing, mostly ripped apart by siege 
and flooding, borders the pathways in all other directions. 
Slight breezes of fresher air drift in occasionally from an 
easterly direction.

A Twisting, Dirty Alleyway~
   The dirt pathway is rather choked here from deposits from the 
river nearby. It jig-saws slightly between corners of moldy 
stone and splintered wood buildings, moving generally east to 
west before cutting abruptly southward. The air is thick and 
heavy with a stale stench, though any breezes coming in from the 
south seem oddly fresher.

A Narrow Dirt Alley With a Stunning View~
   This section of alleyway opens to a stunning view over a 
cliffside that provides a sharp and deadly-looking drop to the 
east. A low, rickety charred wooden fence provides dubious 
protection against those who would wander too close. The waters 
of the Anduin lie far below, and in the hazy distance, the 
opposite shore can be glimpsed on clear days. The grand 
structure of the Star Dome that once towered up to the northeast 
is now collapsed and drab, causing many who see it feel a sinking 
in their hearts. The once Great bridge, named Bele-Iant, no 
longer boasts arches of decorated stonework as it stretched 
across the rushing waters. Now it is mere rubble, though pillars 
still rise in place. A great ship lays wrecked near the western 
shores against the bridge, its belly torn open. The alley 
itself, dingy and cramped compared to the vast view over the 
cliffside, stretches north to south.

A Narrow Dirt Alley West of a Sheer Cliffside~
   This narrow dirt path seems almost precariously narrow, 
bordered to the west by a tall wooden two-story building, but 
dropping sharply off to the east, nothing between a mis-step and 
the plummeting fall that would be sure to follow. The air is 
much fresher here, however, smelling of brackish water and the 
breeze, and the view is expansive, the rushing river visible far 
below. The pathway itself comes to an abrupt end at a wooden 
door to the south which hangs forlornly open most days, and winds 
northward along the cliffside.

burnt and shattered, set at the end of the alley and apart from 
the others homes. Its remaining walls are scrawled over with 
black paint marking depictions of degrading acts. A hole in the 
stone floor leads down to a dark cellar perhaps.

A Small, Dingy Living Room~
   An obvious attempt has been made to make this room hospitable. 
The cracked and stained plaster on the walls has been patched and 
an attempt made to hide the stains with a thin coat of dingy, 
beige paint. A large, worn wool rug covers the scratched and 
creaky floorboards. The room appears to be used for an eating 
and sitting area, a few worn pieces of furniture neatly arranged 
where space allows. A small window has been boarded over with 
odd sized pieces of pine lumber, securely held in place with 
numerous iron nails. Someone has hung a faded blue curtain over 
the boards, in an attempt to conceal them. 
   A steeply angled, creaky staircase leads upstairs to a small 
loft while a solid wooden door set in the southern wall leads out 
to the alleyway.

A Narrow Pathway Near an Intersection to the South~
   The pathway weaves crookedly along from north to south, 
straightening out as it eases past the broad archway leading to 
an open yard to the west, strings of pitiful clay beads that 
serve as a curtain clattering quietly in any breeze. The packed 
dirt underfoot has been trampled until it is hard enough to rival 
stone. Stains of various unidentifiable substances are visible 
here and there. The shadows cast by the decaying, once-grand 
buildings are pressing and morbid.

of burnt out sells of buildings to the north and west, a 
rusted-gate leads to a large area situated to the east, facing 
the dead-ended path. To the south it continues, winding its way 
through the Osgiliath ruins. The ground underfoot is mingled 
river deposits and rubble.

A Large, Reeking Charnel Pit~
   On either side of the hardpacked, dirt path that runs through 
the middle of this lot, stained patches on the ground still reek 
of excrement, but also charred flesh. Possibly once a muckheap, 
this was clearly used later as a charnel pit for the dead and 
dying to be consumed. Fused bones still cling to sections of the 
surrounding walls and it becomes apparent the longer one stays 
here that this was the scene of a great burning of the citizens 
of Osgiliath. A rusted-gate leads out into the cramped alleyway 
to the west.

   This wide yard seems to have once been walled, but has since 
collapsed in many places and is merely constrained by the ruined 
buildings on most side. Piled into corners are volumes of broken 
pieces of pottery. The alleys are visible through clinking 
tattered strings of beads that are hung in the wide archways set 
in the east and south wall, strangely out of place.

A Modest Living Room~
   The lath and plaster walls of this modest living room are 
hanging off in mouldy patches and the building stinks of decay. 
Where plaster is intact, harsh scrawls of crudely drawn acts of 
murder and torture fade. The floorboards are warped and many lay 
free of their original settings, surrounded by dirty puddles. A 
window set in the southern wall looks onto the dirt alleyway 
outside, glass no longer in place. Wall sconces once held 
lanterns but are now bare and rusting. A creaky, narrow 
staircase provides access to the upper floor of the home. The 
reinforced wooden door to the south hangs off its hinges and 
leads out into a dirt alleyway.

A Simple Kitchen and Sitting Room~
   This room is quite large and spacious, simply yet elegantly 
decorated. The floor and walls are built of smooth mahogany 
planks, which are tightly-fitted together without interruption.
Uncarpeted, the smooth planks gleam dully in the light, which is
provided by candles set in sconces evenly spaced along the
walls. One side of the room has been converted into a simple
kitchen, with a stove and cupboards set on the walls, while the
other side contains chairs, a table, and desk, forming a
makeshift study and sitting area.
   Mahogany-trimmed doors are set in the southern, western,

light brown woolen carpet, stretching over most of the open floor 
space. Waxed mahogany boards can be seen in between the carpet 
and various pieces of furniture. Papers, tomes, bottles, and 
various knicknacks are strewn around the room in apparent 
disorder, although there is little dirt to be seen. 
   A large, round window is set in the eastern wall, while a 
mahogany-trimmed door in the western wall is the only means of 
exit from this room.

A Large Warehouse~
   Well-swept and lively, this room's spacious area is given an 
almost cavernous feeling by the vaulted ceiling, almost the 
height of two men. Well-lit by a number of windows high on the 
northern, eastern, and western walls, the room is visible end- 
to-end throughout the entirety of the day. Although a number of 
crates are piled throughout it, they are generally stacked 
straight and neat, lending the place an orderly feel. In the 
center of the room, a thick granite column sprouts from the 
stained pine floorboards, and doors set in the northern, 
southern, and western walls allow egress in those directions. A 
railed balcony is set into the southern wall above the door.

Upon the Granite Column~
   Though in fairly decent shape, the stone column's surface 
bears a good number of blemishes and scratches, offering 
footholds and handholds to those diligent enough to climb upon 
it. What seems like a great deal above it lie the rafters of the 
wooden building, and downward, obviously, lies the cold, 
unyielding floor of the storehouse.

Amid the Rafters of the Warehouse~
   Over fifteen feet above the storehouse floor below, the roof- 
supporting column of the building comes close to the rafters of 
the ceiling, allowing one to climb up onto them with general 
ease. Though not spacious or comfortable by any means, the 
rafters provide a quick route to the windows on the northern, 
western, and eastern walls. A small wooden platform has been 
stretched across the rafters here, providing safe footing near 
the centre of the complex.

Upon a Warehouse Wall at a Shaded Plaza~
   The outer walls of this warehouse, made of large chunks of 
granite, offers little in the means of handholds and footholds, 
but those crafty enough would likely be hindered little by this 
fact. Below at the base of the weathered wall lies a large, 
round, tree-shaded plaza. At least thirty feet from the wall, 
across the plaza, lies a large, ornate building with a row of 
flags before its large doors.

   Obviously a later addition to the warehouse, this small room 
bears a single large window on the western wall, and a thin oaken 
door to the east. A coat of soft, burgundy paint has been 
applied to the pine timbes that form the walls of the room, 
lending the space a little more color than the main floor. 
Though small, the room provides ample space for movement and to 
store a small number of personal effects.

A Large, Flat Rooftop~
   This rooftop's flat surface consists of red-stained wooden 
planks, making a long, broad rectangular surface on which one 
could walk if they wished. The rooftop is rather plain and 
bland, with little in the way of variation. Over the edge on the 
north side is a small plaza, shaded by a ring of maple trees. 
Over the edge to the west, a small hop to a lower roof lies. 
Visible over the edges of the southern and eastern edges is a 
small alleyway, snaking between buildings and the wall of the 
city of Osgiliath.

Alleyway Snaking Between Buildings~
   Barely wide enough for two people to travel shoulder to 
shoulder, this confined alleyway scarcely has more than one or 
possibly two passersby moving through it on their daily tasks. 
Though cramped and dismal, the alley is not dirty; not much in 
the matter of refuse lies in the path, though the occasional 
vermin or stray animal may pass through. A narrow gap between 
two buildings allows one to progress northward, into a shaded 
plaza.

   The alleyway here runs straight a good distance, traversing 
along east and west between a tall warehouse wall to the north 
and the stone wall of Osgiliath to the south. Though little in 
the matter of refuse or trash lies in this path, the 
ivory-cobbled alley is teeming with an abundance of dirt, so much 
so that the path seems to simply become a well-beaten dirt path 
in places. A low window is visible on the northern wall, though 
it does not budge.

leads between several private buildings of the city. This 
particular section stretches north and south from Rath Atanatar 
to the thick, southern wall of Osgiliath, some twenty feet tall. 
Along its length, it offers cramped passage between a two-story 
building with high-set windows to the west and a fenced-in 
courtyard to the east. A small gap between the fence and warehouse
allows one to squeeze back onto Rath Atanatar.

perimeter, however, has been cleared to make room for a number of

room's current use as a student dormitory. A bit drafty due to 
its imposing size, the floor has been carpeted for warmth, and 
bronze lanterns have been inset into recesses in the walls to 
provide ample illumination for study. A wooden screen has been 
installed in the far corner of the chamber to provide scant 
privacy when necessary for the students who live here.

grey stone walls, now ripped, and a large, fringed rug that is 
now threadbare and covered with a crusty layer of tracked-in 
muck. Smoke-marks mar the walls where torches once flickered 
dimly in their sconces. A large archway is set in the western 
wall. A marble statue lays in the northeastern corner of the 
room, and a creaky wooden staircase laboriously winds its way 
upward. Rubble blocks the way eastwards, as if a section of the 
building has collapsed.

Her softly rounded features are covered in a fine layer of dust,
and the tip of her nose is chipped off. Spidery cracks mar the
grey-veined white marble of her form in many places, and one arm
is broken clean off at the shoulder. The other arm is outstreched
in a gesture of beckoning, which only serves to display the lack

shining ringmail, the man's mouth forming a silent, shouted
challenge. The orc is clearly losing, a beam of light glowing

effort made to clean and smooth the ancient wooden floorboards,

smoke marks licking along the walls and ceiling. A large portion

A Spacious, Musty Stone Room~
   This spacious room looks large enough for several sizeable 
pieces of furniture, but that is perhaps its only virtue. The 
walls and ceiling are made of dreary, moldy grey stone, and the 
only window is a small, barred opening near the ceiling, which 
barely serves to let in enough light to see by during the day. 
The wooden panelling of the floor is now gouged and splintered in 
many places, and is oddly lighter in some spots, as if large 
fixtures had been removed after being there for some time.

A Drab, Stone-Walled Room~
   Smelling vividly at any particular moment of a mixture of 
Westmansweed and woodsmoke, this room's spacious, rectangular 
form could provide enough space for two people and some larger 
pieces of furniture with relative ease. Aside from the smell, 
the room's most notable feature is, ironically, its lack of 
features. The four drab and crumbling stone walls seem nearly 
identical to one another. The ceiling and floor are both made of 
worn, scratched, and stained old timbers of an unknown type. 
Save for the door in the northern wall, there are no windows or 
other exits.

A Stone-Walled, Smoky Smelling Room~
   This room smells faintly of woodsmoke, the scent seemingly 
imbued into the hard grey stone of the walls and ceiling. The 
floor underfoot is creaky wooden panelling, splintered in many 
places. There is a lone, small window high on the wall near the 
ceiling, letting in a scant amount of light during the day. 
Suspicious looking rusty-red stains mar the floor near the 
doorway, and the air is somewhat stifling, but the room itself is 
fairly large, providing plenty of space for a few sizeable pieces 
of furniture.

A Noxious Smelling Stone Hallway~
   A pungent unpleasant odour fills this narrow, drab and musty 
hallway which stretches southward from the wooden staircase 
tucked into the northern part of the room. The high wooden 
ceiling is cast into shadow at all times of the day, and the 
creaky floorboards beneath are littered with small bones and 
chunks of dubious looking matter. Old sconces hang upon the 
walls, one stuffed with a smelly half-burned rag. One of the two 
doors here has a jagged split rending its weathered wood, and 
revealing a glimpse of the room beyond.

A Worn and Weary Suite Room~
   This room was obviously well crafted from stone but now bears 
the signs of many years of wear and tear. In places the stones 
are starting to come loose and remain there only by virtue of 
some crumbling plaster patching. A wide archway leads into the 
adjoining room to the west. A pair of small nests rest in the 
corner of the room, made of old, soiled wallhangings and the 
remnants of a burgundy curtain.

have been considered beautiful in times past. The area is joined 
to another to the east via an archway, and on the northern wall, 
a small, grimy-paned window overlooks the street. There were 
other windows set into the western wall at one point, evidenced 
by the unevenly patched and boarded-over areas.

A Musty, Dimly-Lit Stone Hallway~
   The stones that make up this hallway are solid and may have 
once formed the bones of a grand and glorious structure; now, 
they are chipped, smoke-stained, and covered with mold, and the 
air is musty and stale. A single threadbare tapestry provides 
the only remaining decoration along the southern wall, in a 
slight recess just before the steep staircase twisting its way 
upward. The only window is in the southern wall, and though 
sizeable, has been boarded up firmly. A steep stone stairway 
leads upward to a third floor, darkness shrouding the area above. 
The eastern section of the hallway is blocked by rubble and 
timbers.

crumbling but functional masonry. A few faded wall-hangings are 
tacked up over the north and west wall, serving the dual purposes 
of warding off cold, and adding some touches of color to the 
otherwise bare room. The floor is undecorated, being simple 
wooden planking, creaking and splintery with age. The walls are

The walls consist of crumbling but functional masonry, covered 
with aged and crackling whitewash, except for a single wall
that has been painted in a shade of yellow. The woodplanked floor
is smooth and worn, covered mostly by a thick and dusty wool rug 
which has been nailed directly into the floor all along the 
edges. The area retains a quaint, and to some even cozy, air, 
and seems fairly secure behind the thick if battered oaken door.

the western wall, a waterstain in the floorboards below it. On 
the west and east side of the hallway are set weathered doors, 
one rent and splintered, leading to rooms. A tarnished lantern 
half-hangs from the wall. To the north the hallway continues on 
and to the south a stairway leads down to the second floor.

likewise, are all the same color - though it is hard to pinpoint

   Though compact in size, this room's small stature gives it a 
quaint, cozy nature. The sounds and smells of Osgiliath are 
easily heard in here, as a stone-framed, shuttered window is set 
into the eastern wall. The walls of this room all share a 
similar quirk: long, wispy trails of black are singed into them, 
painting a picture of a previous intense flame in the room. The 
rest of the room, however, bears no witness to this occurence, as 
the floorboards and ceiling all look recently-replaced, and 
underfoot is a thick if faded blue woolen rug.

floor open to the elements. The stone of the walls and floor has 
grown a cover of thick moss and mold, and vines have even taken

for several people to stand in at once. A large stall has been 
set up in the back, shanks of still-bloody meat strung up on

ceiling~
The frescoed ceiling features richly-colored designs but
from this height, one can begin to discern stains from water
which at one time must have leaked through the roof. In some
places, the plaster has fallen away leaving small holes in
the painting. While once brilliant, the colors have long
since darkened beneath a layer of soot and dirt.

mural~
Examination of the wall from this close reveals that it is
suffering from severe moisture damage. Additionally, the
paint is flaking and what pigment remains is covered with a
layer of dirt and soot accumulated over the decades if not
centuries. From this vantage point, one can just make out
some writing on the mural's upper-left corner.

Roped-Off Corner of a Storehouse~
   This small area has been separated from the rest of the room 
by a worn rope, attached to poles extending from the floor. The 
area has been kept relatively clear of debris, although it still 
maintains the poor conditions visible throughout the entire room. 
Rough racks bearing training weapons line the western wall, and a 
large circle has been clearly marked out on the rough floorboards 
in the center of the roped area. 
   On the other side of the rope is a makeshift kitchen area, and 
the rest of a large room.

A Debased Alley Between Rath Gil and the Northern Ruins~

between the aging shops of Rath Gil, were it not littered with 
stacks of rotten lumber and firewood along the east side, 
offering easy access to the remnants of a roof above. This muddy 
path leads south to Rath Gil, a gap lending a view of the old

have collected the dirt and rainwater over the years. Though

A Drafty Wooden-Walled Kitchen~
   This room has little space for more than one person to stand 
or sit comfortably, what with its walls being near to one another 
and the stove, counter, and number of shelves and cabinets in it. 
While it smells rather strongly of cooked - and overcooked - 
meat, occasionally one may catch a hint of jasmine or lavender. 
Breezy drafts occasionally waft through the room through the 
window, its shutter long broken.

Collapsed Remains of Scaffolding~
   Logs and ropes and nails rise high overhead in a jumbled, 
chaotic state of disrepair from a collapse above. It seems that 
scaffolding has crashed down from the side of the Great Dome and 
ended up here in this tumble of ramps and lashed sections of 
planking. 
   Above, the wreckage offers some precarious leverage to climb a 
little way, though it looks highly dangerous and stops no more 
than halfway up the side of the ruined structure.

during the day from a series of windows that dot the northern, 
eastern and southern walls, and at night from a series of sconced 
lanterns on either end of the room. Wooden furniture dots the 
room sparsely, set over a series of fine fur rugs. The room is 
painted, for the most part, a rich burgundy, accented buy touches 
of gold and silver. A number of paintings hang from the walls, 
depicting various scenes of a white-walled city, and moments of 
battle.

along the floor and makeshift shelving has been affixed to the 
wall. Those suffering from clausterphobia would find the cramped 
quarters extremely uncomfortable. A layer of dust covers the

An Underground Brewery~
   A massive, meticulously maintained brewery has been built into 
the earth here. The walls, carved out of solid rock and earth, 
have been panelled with stained oak planks that help the room 
retain the hot, humid atmosphere required for the trade performed 
here. A simple shaft carved into the wall, which disappears 
after many feet, offers the room's only ventilation. The floor 
is inset with smooth, neatly arranged stone flags with a large 
drain in the center of the room for excess water or spillage to 
be mopped into. Several thin stone columns, with a small ivy 
pattern engraved on their surface, stretch from the smoothed 
floor to the ceiling and ensure structural integrity. 
Meticulously maintained, it looks as though this room is kept as 
clean as possible with what some might consider compulsive care. 
A sturdy door, set in the eastern wall, leads out into the 
storage room.

complex, ending in a set of heavy, iron-braced wooden doors. The 
floor is bare stone, chipped in some parts from heavy foot 
traffic as armored men pass through. Torches flicker softly from 
wall mountings, keeping the hallway lit at all hours. The walls 
are smooth stone as well, bare and drab, except in the northern 
wall, where symmetrical holes along both sides of the door seem 
to go through into a room to the north. A light layer of dust 
covers the corners and the walls.

into the complex. Rather cramped, the ceiling stands just a head 
or two above the tallest of the soldiers. The walls and floor 
are bare stone, cool to the touch even in the warm summer hours. 
A oaken door with a barred window sits in the eastern wall. The 
door to the south is quite large, made of sturdy wooden planks 
reinforced by iron. Symmetrical holes run down on each side of

close together to house the maximum number of soldiers, making

room is provided by thick candles placed in wall sconces. Off 
duty soldiers congregate here at all times, either to catch some 
quick rest, or to converse with their fellow comrades.

the room turns to the east. Plain wooden bunk beds line each 
side of the room, soldiers occupying a few at all times. The

rest, or starting another long shift by slowly gearing up. A

some steps have been taken to make the men and women here 
somewhat at ease on their off duty hours. The hard, cold stone 
floor has been covered by a coarse rug, covering almost the 
entire floor. Tapestries hang from the walls, depicting scenes 
of battle and valor, though some are too worn to make out much 
detail. The recent use has left marks in the carpet, areas where 
years worth of dust have been recently disturbed.

the commanders of the military here, and also as a strategic 
planning center. Many smaller maps line the walls, each 
representing a section of the Ithilien and the surrounding 
countryside. A much larger map covers an entire table in the 
center of the room, pins of varying color denoting enemy troop 
movements, allied forces, and locations of note.

A Cramped Armory~
   Other than a small area cleared near the entrance, there is 
very little room left in this armory. Metal weapons set upon 
wooden racks glint in the torchlight, compiled of swords, maces, 
axes, halberds, the instruments of war neatly laid out. Wooden 
crates and chests have been neatly arranged, armor and various 
supplies within. The eastern wall is dominated by a series of 
shelves. Brass lanterns hanging from the wooden crossbeams cast 
a flickering light over the room.

The Officers' Quarters~
   This smaller room serves as the barracks for the officers of 
the facility. A thick dark-green carpet covers the cold stone 
floor, tall candles casting a dull light over the room. Simple 
wooden beds lay against the northern and western walls, small 
chests at the foot at each. The room is neat and organized, well 
kept, no spots of dirt or dust.

A Winding Stairwell Leading to the Battlements~
   Wooden stairs crawl upward, winding through at a fairly steep 
incline around the edges of the shaft. The stairs themselves 
look quite worn, though they look sturdy enough for their simple 
job. A wooden railing runs along the inner edge of the stairs, 
stout enough to prevent most from toppling over its edges to 
their demise. Torches mounted along the wall provide light to 
the stairwell, which ends at a small platform, leading to a stout 
door in the southern wall.

provides a broad view of the lands east of Osgiliath. Thick 
stone walls raise to waist level, a wooden roof supported by four 
oaken beams, allowing a clear line of vision outward. Jagged 
snow covered peaks are visible far the east.

enough for only a single person. The low ceiling forces all but

ends at a broad, richly-stained door, fashioned of fine pinewood. 
The walls of the entry hall are decorated with bolts of burgundy 
fabric, and are set with a number of thick glass windows, rimmed 
in bronze. A series of polished, silvery wall-lanterns light the 
hall at night. A long, red rug with golden tassles runs the

Exquisite items of every flavor are flaunted and sold here, from 
delicate, hand-crafted glassware, to trinkets of gold, silver and 
bronze. A richly stained mahogany counter borders the western 
wall. To the south, a large, carved wooden door is cut into the

   A large, open meeting room unfurls here, the marble floor 
draped in a series of soft, hand-woven carpets, rich with a full 
tapestry of color. Benches, beautifully carved, are set against 
the western and southern walls, beneath broad bay windows, rimmed 
in polished bronze. Chairs and other fine furniture are 
positioned about the space, cushioned and well-decorated. 
Sculptures, paintings and other detailed artwork is set about the 
enclosure, including an impressive portrait of an armor-clad 
warrior hung on the southern wall, boxed in by a massive, 
gold-leafed wooden frame. 
   A large, carved, wooden door permits entry to the Emporium to

Shelves and cabinetry line the walls, filled with glassware and 
other delicate goods. The room receives little light, 
illuminated by a thin window during the day, and a single brass 
wall-lantern at night. The walls are painted a bright sky blue, 
and are panelled with white birchwood to compensate. 
   A glass-paned door provides a glimpse of the exquisite items 
stored in the cupboard built into the northern wall while a 
reinforced door to the east leads out to the Emporium's meeting 
room. A trapdoor leads down into a small storage cellar.

A Cemetery Beneath Stone Walls~
   The ancient stone walls of the city overshadow this cemetery 
that holds the remains of those fallen in battle. Lush green 
grass grows over many mounds, while many more are covered with 
freshly-turned earth. Some graves are marked with elaborate 
headstones. Others, however, are less fortunate, and have 
nothing more than a roughly-carved rock to mark the burial site 
of the fallen. The shadow of the walls only adds to the somber, 
subdued atmosphere here.

seems rather cozy. The flooring appears to be made of stained 
mahogany, heavily lacquered to protect its finish. The walls are 
stained a rich, deep umber, which would give a dark feel to the 
entire room, were it not for the two large bay windows that look 
out over Rath Gil and the private housing beyond. The space is 
softly lit, when daylight wanes, by several bronze wall sconces. 
An impressive marble fireplace dominates the northern wall while 
a richly stained bar dwells in the far southern corner of the 
room. The atmosphere and patrons that frequent the lounge are 
more decorous than that of the busy commons and main gathering 
room situated downstairs. There is a sturdy door set in the 
eastern wall and a set of steep stairs provides egress to the 
hallway of the floor below.

to allow for many people to mingle inside it easily as they wander

   It is a rectangular room made with a wooden floor and walls,
and a higher-than-average ceiling that gives this otherwise small
room a spacious feel. The ceiling slopes downward from east to
west, leading to windows that let in some fresh air and light.
There are no closets, but there is room for a few pieces of simple
furniture.

A Shrouded Pool in a Lush Parkland~
   The cool, clear waters of this silvan pond provide a welcome 
respite from the clamor and crowd of the surrounding village. 
Perhaps ten meters in diameter, this sizeable pool is ideal for 
swimming and recreation during Osgiliath's temperate spring and 
summer seasons, and as a result is a frequent stop for many. To 
the south rises the grassy shore of the parkland, and to the 
north various flora have taken root, beyond which rises 
Osgiliath's northern city wall.

The Bottom of a Shrouded Pool~
   Almost completely clear, the pristine waters of this parkland 
pond are tranquil, sweet and cool. The bottom of the pond is 
home to countless stones, smoothed by the ages, and a number of 
plants, fallen trees, and other such bits of history. In 
addition, every so often a glint of metal may be seen here or 
there, perhaps testament to a coin tossed into the silvan pond 
for good fortune, a common custom among Osgiliath's working folk.

Twisting Hand-Dug Tunnel~
   Leading from north to south in a twisting, turning way, the 
course of this hand-dug tunnel diverting slightly whenever 
anything such as solid rock or age-old masonry pokes out from the 
dark earth. The passage through the underground is rather wide, 
the base of this tunnel having been well padded down and solid 
wooden timbers used to prop up the walls and roof against 
collapse. To the north, the path twists onwards and at a slight 
ascent, while to the south a plank of wood has been crudely 
strapped across the tunnel.

Hand-Dug Tunnel Descending Southwards~
   As this trail leads southwards, it descends at a irregular 
rate, the tunnel twisting and veering sharply through its journey 
deep under the ground. Still, stale air hangs heavily between 
the confines of the wide-set wooden support beams, the silence 
broken by little save the scurrying of rodents underfoot. The 
earthen walls of this tunnel bear the marks of shovels and picks 
upon them, the regularity of the work clearly placing them as 
having been dug through the use of basic tools, and some time in 
the recent past. To the north the tunnel ends, a small ceiling 
of loose cobbles set above it.

Small Common Room~
   Wooden planks form the walls and floor of this small common in 
the shack, the pine bearing a mellow tone. The ceiling slopes 
upwards to an apex in the center of the chamber, tiles place over 
the thick beams. A single, heavy door opens outwards from this 
shack, through which the faint sounds of Osgiliath filter in. To 
the south, a smaller alcove branches off, a sheet of heavy burlap 
positioned over the passageway.

   Extending outwards from the main room of this spartan shack 
that lies beyond a burlap curtain, this small alcove is barely 
big enough for its furnishings and a few occupants. A tiled 
roof, its apex not too far overheard, houses a few silky cobwebs 
and rogue spiders, yet the rest of the area, its wooden walls and 
floors, seem free of dust, grime and bugs.

Upon the Tower Battlements Directly Above the City Gates~
   Fortified and stout, this tower stands as a sentinel directly 
above the city gates, allowing its defenders to keep a constant 
vigil over their city. There is a constant presence of soldiers 
and guardsman, keeping a wary eye at all times to the dangers of 
the east. Beyond the thick stone crenellations, far in the 
distance to the east, the black mountains lay, their snow topped 
peaks forming the impenetrable barrier into Mordor. Directly 
east from the city however, green farmlands grow, and beyond them 
a thick and green forest blankets the countryside.

blocks the view of the rest of the room, allowing someone to 
dress or sleep in complete privacy. A section of lightly

with a deeply-stained pine-plank floor. A barred window provides 
fresh air and brightens the space during the day. The strong 
smell of stale beer is almost overpowering when you enter the 
room. A sturdy door to the north leads out into a room nearer 
the street while a narrow staircase provides access to the loft. 
A trapdoor, sunk into the floor is edged with dusty soot.

scuffed in several places. The strong scent of stale beer

even when the room is lit. A small, rough bed has been pushed 
against one wall, as well as the personal effects of one person 
at most. The only exit is a narrow door to the north, leading to

old, slightly crumbling walls of limestone. The floor underfoot 
is comprised entirely of dark-red-stained timbers, recently

is mostly bare, with a thin, threadbare carpet lain in the middle 
of the floor. To the north, a door leads further into the

fashioned of grey stone, as is the domed ceiling. A 
cedar-panelled floor runs underfoot, clean but often cluttered. 
A small, square window, bordered in bronze, permits light to 
filter into the enclosure during the daytime, while a series of 
sconzed lanterns provide illumination at night.

The air in this room is very still, and the dampness nearly

   Well-trimmed and stately, this lawn is more than merely a 
shaded sward of grass. With enough room to comfortably occupy 
nearly thirty people, the lawn is sparsely but tastefully 
decorated with the occasional shrubbery and a pair of tall, 
stout, obviously ancient trees: one stands near the northern 
wall, and one near the southern, effectively extending shade over 
most of the lawn during all hours except noontime. 
   A stonework wall, flush with the building to the northwest, 
encloses the area here, twice the height of the average man.

   This large ballroom is impressive built and lavishly 
decorated. It has a high, domed ceiling with intricate designs 
carved into the stone, and is supported by four marble pillars 
even spaced throughout the grand hall and each expertly carved. 
Large, stained glass windows depicting a variety of images allow 
a good deal of light from without to enter the room, reflecting 
spashes of various colours across the highly polished, marble 
floor. Two crystal chandeliers are suspended from the ceiling 
above and several burning lamps hang from hooks in the walls. 
Adding further decoration to the walls are a number of brightly 
coloured tapestries and paintings creating an atmosphere of life 
and merriment.

Shadowy Alleyway Between Two Large Buildings~
   Cramped and quiet, this passage between two of Osgiliath's 
stone-walled buildings bordering it comes to an abrupt halt 
northward, where it ends at a large, two-story wooden fence. The 
sun is nearly blotted out, save for directly above, casting 
sinister shadows all about the alleyway. A stack of abandoned, 
dusty crates has been made here, long gathering dust in the dirt 
floor, cobblestones either long gone or never present. 
   Southward is the only obvious exit, leading to the Plaza.

regular intervals. The traffic here is extremely limited, with 
only an occasional guard passing by. Birds are often heard 
chirping overhead, while to the west the River Anduin can be 
heard flowing between its banks, lending a peaceful atmosphere to 
the area.

An Unadorned Common Room~
   Simply stained panels line the unadorned walls of this common 
room on the first floor. An occasional resident crosses 
reservedly over the even, pinewood floor, but the room is 
typically calm and quiet enough to allow personal reflection or a 
subdued conversation to go on uninterrupted. Sterile and open, 
the space in this room is well-used, with few objects to 
interrupt the flow of light and air. A soft, though not 
extravagantly plush, rectangular rug lain out in the center of 
the floor adds a splash of rich burgundy color to the otherwise 
muted interior. A pale oak door set in the south wall leads out 
to a cobbled pathway, its doorframe made slightly conspicuous by 
a subtle, decorative ridge lining the edge. Doors of a similar 
stain are set into the north and west walls, and an alcove in the 
eastern wall houses a stairwell leading up to the second floor. 
A fireplace is set in the southern wall, next to the door.

A Sterile Dormitory~
   Long, simply-stained wooden panels stretch from the ceiling to 
the pinewood floor. The room is rather sterile, without any 
adornment save the brown-curtained window set into the western 
wall that overlooks the Anduin not far to the west. Though not 
cramped, this room is not large enough to hold much furniture, 
nor more than two or three people comfortably. A simple woolen 
rug, the same shade of brown as the curtains, is set before the 
pale oaken door that opens eastward into the common room.

A Sparsely-Furnished Dormitory~
   Long slats of pine wood, half a foot wide, run parallel to 
each other, stretching across the room, making the floor of the 
room. Stretching from the floor to the ceiling are wide wooden 
panels, slightly darker than the floor. A white rug is set in 
front of the door, while a matching set of white curtains adorn 
the window to the north. The room is rather bland otherwise, 
with only a few pieces of furniture occupying the space. A door 
of pale oak stands to the south, allowing egress into the common 
room of the building.

A Small, Pine-Walled Kitchen~
   Brightened during the day by warm sunlight spraying through a 
window in the southern wall, this cozy room is as close to a 
nexus of activity as can be found in this quiet building, 
frequently playing host to the sounds of cooking, eating, and 
pleasant conversation. The simply-stained pine walls are imbued 
with the olfactory evidence of many hearty meals prepared within. 
Along the eastern wall is an alcove housing a stairwell leading 
down to the first floor, and the pale oak doors on the north and 
west walls are in good repair. A chimney runs up the southern 
wall.

Lond Caras-Mir Approaching the Walls of a City to the North~
   Wide enough to bear two wagons side by side to each other upon 
it, the road of Lond Caras-Mir rarely sees such traffic in these 
times, the black-and-white pattern created by the cobbles in 
disarray with the numerous potholes in the path. An occasional 
guard patrol or a farmer bearing a cart full of goods for a city 
market is all the excitement the road sees now. The grass side 
by side the road grows high and untamed, and the gentle farmlands 
of Anorien can be seen to the north and west, the River Anduin 
flowing swiftly not far to the east. 
   A short distance to the north-east the walls of the city of 
Osgiliath can be seen as the city itself moves out east over the 
River Anduin.

Lond Caras-Mir Turns South and East~
   The strong walls of the city of Osgiliath, once the capital of 
Gondor, rise up a distance to the north-east, the city itself 
located over the running waters of the broad River Anduin. A 
slight, sporadic flow of farmers, vagrants and guardsmen walk on 
past on the wide road, giving little attention to much save 
themselves. To the south-west the White Mountains stretch off to 
west, disappearing over the horizon, while not far off the road 
to the east the western shore of the River Anduin lies. Closer 
off Lond Caras-Mir lies irrigated farmland and fallow fields. 
   To the south Lond Caras-Mir forms onto a straight path, while 
to the east it rises, sloping upward past two fortified towers to 
the gates of the city of Osgiliath.

Lond Caras-Mir Runs North and South, Parallel to the River Anduin~
   Lond Caras-Mir, the road that branches the distance between 
the ancient city of Osgiliath and the walls of the Pelennor 
Fields, runs through the countryside of Anorien here. Basalt and 
some type of white rock have been down side by side as the paving 
stones of the road, creating a contrasting pattern of light and 
dark that has been faded and worn away by time. Only a few 
people make their way along the road, the majority of them 
farmers, taking their wares to and fro the city and countryside. 
   The straight set course of the black-and-white cobbled road 
continues to the north and south.

road of Lond Caras-Mir rarely sees such traffic in these times,

   Lond Caras-Mir runs from east to west through the farmland of 
Anorien. To the west it approaches a large gate in white stone 
wall known as the Rammas Echor.

Before the Gate of the Rammas Echor~
   Lond Caras-Mir, the road that branches the distance between 
the ancient city of Osgiliath and the walls of the Pelennor 
Fields, runs through the countryside of Anorien here. Basalt and 
some type of white rock have been down side by side as the paving

people make their way along the road, the majority of them 
farmers, taking their wares to and fro the city and countryside. 
   The Rammas Echor, the stalwart stone wall that protects the 
Pelennor Fields, lies to the west, a large wooden gate bound with 
iron bands set in it as the base of Lond Caras-Mir. Lanterns 
flank the road for a short distance here as it runs out to the 
east.

A Garishly-Painted Sideroom~
   The wooden walls of this wide sideroom have been neatly 
painted a deep, garish crimson in colour, and various pieces of 
comfortable, none-too-expensive furniture are set about the room. 
The smells of sweat and ale permeates the room, along with the 
oil of lanterns that keep it amply lit at all hours. A small 
fighting ring dominates the western wall, though it is kept roped 
off at most times. 
   An open, stylized archway leads eastward, and a curtain of 
beads leads southward, into a room smelling of far sweeter 
incense and perfume.

A Small, Mauve-Painted Lounge~
   There is little free space in this room, the majority of it 
taken up by the furniture present here. An old, beaten brass 
chandelier hangs from the center of the ceiling, casting light 
and shadow about the room. The smell of various cheap incenses 
and perfumes mingle with one another, adding a generally 
pleasant, if not strong, odor to the room. Several paintings 
hang from the walls, none of much artistic merit. The walls have 
been painted a gaudy mauve, splashes of pink here and there. 
   A stairway along the southern wall leads upward, while several 
strings of glass beads hung from the archway to the north allow 
easy egress in that direction.

on unseen currents. Doors have been set into the northern, 
western, and eastern walls.

   The sporadically mauve-painted walls of this room are hemmed 
close together, providing just enough room for, perhaps, three or 
four people. A large mirror dominates the northern wall, stools 
set before it, and a shelf between the seats and the reflective 
glass contains tray after tray of makeup and powder. Many cheap 
perfumes, as well as the faint trace of incense, assail the nose 
here. 
   A large curtain separates this room from the one to the east, 
while a solid door blocks it off from the room westward.

   The walls of this musty chamber have collapsed inward, 
littering its edges with misshapen stones. The room is dim and 
rather cold, the stones of the walls being cool to the touch. A 
faint trickling of water can be heard when the chamber is silent, 
bubbling off in the distance. A series of piled stones lead up 
to a wooden trapdoor set in the apex of the chamber's ceiling, 
fashioned of thick wood, braced with iron. The air is dusty, 
scattered with airborn debris.

wall, and a staircase leading upward has been built there. 
Narrow scrapes run down the length of the corridor, etched into

the bedroom, kitchen, and every other room in a normal house. A 
stove is shoved against the northern wall, a small chimney 
leading up through the roof. A bed is shoved nearby, and a 
rickety table occupies the rest of the remaining space. The 
floor is made of squeaky pine planks, while the walls are made of 
cedar, like the rest of the attic. This room is completely 
unadorned, lacking even a window.

Freshly plastered walls have been washed with a light layer of 
beige hued paint. The space is bathed in soft light cast off by 
a row of evenly spaced bronze wall sconces. Several bronze hooks 
affixed near the doorway, provide a place to hang cloaks and 
hats. 
   A stately door with a sturdy iron lock leads out to the front 
steps and down to the street below while a sliding, panelled door 
to the north provides access to a bedroom. The hallway travels 
further along to the east and leads into a living room.

   The richly stained polished floorboards of this room are

As with the other rooms in the apartment, the freshly plastered 
walls of the living area are painted a beige hue. An arched, 
grey brick fireplace is built into the southern wall, providing 
warmth and cheer during cold or dreary weather. Several pieces 
of furniture are arranged about the room, the sedate colours of 
the furnishings lend a masculine feel to the space. 
   A sliding, panelled door set in the north wall leads into a 
kitchen and dining area while a glass-paned door set in the east 
wall leads out onto a balcony.

   A view of the neighbouring buildings and streets can be seen 
while looking out over the iron railing of this outdoor balcony. 
Just large enough to accomodate a bench and a few flowerpots or 
planter boxes, this small patio provides an intimate place for 
visiting with a loved one or stealing a quiet moment alone to 
relax and get a breath of fresh air. 
   A glass-paned door provides ingress into an apartment.

A Tidy Kitchen And Dining Area.~
   Roomy and immaculately kept, this area has been put to use for 
both cooking and dining. The kitchen area is situated in the 
western half of the room while a small dining area has been 
arranged on the opposite side. A series of shelves and various 
other pieces of furniture are strategically placed, making utmost 
use of the available floor space. An arched, curtained window 
set in the eastern wall provides a source of light during the 
day. A hearth set in the northwestern corner of the cooking area 
provides a source of heat during cold weather. The walls are 
freshly plastered and painted a muted olive-green hue. 
   A sliding, panelled door to the south leads out into a living 
room.

A Spacious Bedroom.~
   Roomy enough to accommodate several large pieces of furniture, 
this spacious bedroom is modestly decorated. The freshly 
plastered walls are painted a beige hue and the richly stained 
polished floorboards covered with a large, rectangular wool rug 
dyed a sedate shade of burgundy. Heavy indigo coloured curtains 
cover a glass-paned window set into the west wall. The window 
provides a view of the cobblestone road outside. The room's 
modest trappings and sombre decor lend a masculine feel to the 
space.

A Choked Path Between Fallen Buildings~
   Partially collapsed structures and the debris that has fallen 
from them choke this path that must have at one time been an 
alleyway. Chunks of stone and snapped timbers have become mixed 
in with the ancient piles of garbage that once littered this 
alley, causing one to meander in order to continue either north, 
onto the street, or south, further into the alley.

A Rubble-Strewn Path Amidst Ruins~
   This alleyway is filled with the remnants of nearby buildings. 
Stone, especially, litters the ground, most of it spilling from 
the large pile of rubble that was formerly a structure of large 
size. The alley comes to a halt before a solid wall of stone to 
the south. 
   To the east is a stone building which seems to have largely 
escaped the destruction surrounding it.

A Ruined Single-Story Building~
   This single-story building obviously weathered whatever 
destruction befell the city better than most. Three of the stone 
walls of this room are almost wholly intact, save for a few 
fractures caused by the added stress of the eastern wall, which 
has been irreparably damaged. A large hole exists in the wall, 
though which spills rubble from a collapsed building on the other 
side. Despite the structural damage, the building appears to be 
stable. 
   An open doorway exits westward to a rubble-strewn pathway, 
while the southern doorway leads into another room of the 
structure.

of the fallen city, ravaged by war.

Windows set high in the walls flood the room with light during 
the day, and during the evening, well-placed sconces keep the 
room bright throughout the night. The walls have been liberally 
coated with fresh whitewash, reinforcing the light, and a 
multitude of shelves have been built upon them. A long, sturdy 
bench of stone is built into the eastern wall, only broken by the 
door. 
   Open archways lead north and south, while a door leads east 
and a second door, painted royal blue, is set in the center of 
the western wall. A staircase cut into the southern wall leads

Long, Very Narrow Tunnel~
   This tunnel is extremely narrow, forcing anyone who goes 
through it to travel in single file. The walls are very smooth 
and the ceiling is almost high enough for a grown man to stand up 
straight, but not quite. It has clearly been hand-hewn. The 
tunnel continues in a more or less north to south direction, 
snaking this way and that as it does.

it serves its purpose with its various furnishings and equipment.

walkway continues north and south along the base of the west 
wall. Two man-lengths across the thin, flowing muck is a similar 
path on the south side of the east tunnel. It seems to slip 
under the murky depths not far beyond. Recessed in the arched 
west wall of this tunnel is a worn, iron-banded door, the bottom 
of which has a ragged gaping opening.

Anduin. The door to the east seems blocked, parts of it crumbled

Wading Through a Filthy Sewer~
   This ancient Gondorian sewer passage begins to make a gentle 
slope downward here. Approaching the eastern extent, the pathway 
of bricks lining the base of the southern edge of the tunnel 
begins to slip below the surface of the pooling, malodorous 
water. Filthy water pours out of chutes that line the northern 
wall at relatively even intervals. To the east it appears the 
tunnel continues its descent, although the water does not seem 
to. A cool zephyr of wind can be felt from the west.

Swimming in the Fetid Waters of the Sewer~
   Solid footing is not at option in this segment of ancient 
sewer work. The ceiling closes in on this passage, as the tunnel 
continues to slope downward to the east. When the waters are 
calm a faint spiraling current can be felt; an indication that 
these waters are slowly draining down along the intended course 
of the tube. The ceiling in the center of this tunnel appears 
relatively dry, contrasting with the slimy appearance the rest of 
the stone walls seem to have.

   The fetid waters completly fill this section of tunnel from 
top to bottom. The repulsive filth assaults the senses, burning 
the eyes and filling the nostrils. One might retch were it not 
for the overwhelming fear of what taking in a mouthful of the 
toxic water might do. Things occasionally brush against the body 
in the darkness here; a mixture of both waste debris and the 
small foul creatures that thrive in this offensive aquatic 
environment. The tunnel continues downward to the east, though 
even the most stone-willed find them turned back.

objects of wood and steel that would need closer inspection to 
define what they are used for. The only portion of this room 
that is lit is an area on the southern wall. The floor is sticky 
and smell slightly of decay, and where the light touches, one can 
see old, dreid blothes of blood, as well as a few new puddles.

providing light during the daytime. Three doors are set into the

limited view of the cobblestone street beyond. A slender 
staircase winds upward to a small trapdoor above, the polished

pieces of furniture have been set at odd angles about the room, 
nearly concealing a short doorway set into the room's western 
wall. A small footstool has been left in the attic's 
northeastern corner, above which sits a rectangular trapdoor, set 
with a large iron knob.

beams that steeple to a point above the centre of the building 
have been covered with thatch to keep out the worst of the 
weather. A small curtained window set in the northern wall looks 
out into a small confined yard. Little occupies the stone floor

rudimentary pieces of furniture are scattered about. A trapdoor 
in the floor leads down into a root cellar while a solid oak door 
in the east wall opens out onto a narrow path.

A Narrow Path~
   This narrow path leads westward around the side of a small 
cottage situated to the north, providing access to another 
smaller stone cottage tucked further back out of the way. The 
path itself is hardpacked dirt and is lined on either side by 
tall shade trees. To the east lies a wide path that leads 
further into the graveyard.

litters the spacious room, set near two fluted columns carved 
into the sweeping bulk of the southern wall. A cast iron stove 
is set into the eastern wall, its blackened stovepipe crawling 
upward through a space in the ceiling. A thin, rectangular door 
of black oak, bordered by bookshelves and cubbies once filled

An Archer's Box Set in the Southeastern Battlements~
   This is a small archer's box that has been set into the 
battlements atop the southeastern walls of Osgiliath. It is 
reached through a narrow gap in the wall to the west and 
overlooks the woods and hills of Northern Ithilien to the east. 
An archer can set himself up here and scan the woods for enemies 
from a position of relative safety.

A Small, Stone-Walled Latrine~
   This room is small, though not too cramped. The walls are all 
of stone and rise high up into the ceiling, where there is a 
narrow chute that leads up towards the open air above. The chute 
is covered by a metal grille. In the middle of the room, though 
near to the southern wall, is a deep hole in the ground, the 
latrine obviously, with a wooden seat over the top of it, sanded 
down so as to be relatively smooth. A thick oak door separates 
the room from the hallway outside.

Bare Remains of a Balcony~
   Barely wide enough for a few people to stand, this narrow 
balcony looks out over the remains of the packed-dirt alley 
below. Though the view is somewhat lacking, the balcony gets a 
good amount of afternoon sun when the season and weather permits. 
Where the roof of the building has been torn off, it has taken 
the partition with it, leaving a naked door and frame standing 
alone.

Amongst Stalls West of the Main Stables~
   Stalls radiate in three directions out from this extension of 
the main stables to the east. The floor of packed dirt is strewn 
with loose bundles of hay, and is cluttered by numerous crates 
and sacks of grain. The room is rather dim, lit by a coal-fired 
brazier in an alcove in the north-eastern corner. The atmosphere 
is one of an oppressive heat, and the air here bears a distinct, 
earthy smell. The stalls surrounding the room are fashioned of 
fine oaken panels, and are seemingly well kept.

A Small Below-Ground Pantry~
   Heavy planks of pine constitute the walls of this small 
subterranean pantry, the ground consisting of hard packed earth. 
It is only the slightest bit taller than a woman of average 
height, let alone a man, and it is certainly no more than a half 
dozen yards in either length or breadth. The floor of the 
kitchen above forms the roof, which throws an unhealthy amount of 
dust into this claustrophobic room's atmosphere when someone 
walks overhead. A small wooden stepladder provides the means of 
getting back up through the trapdoor leading to the kitchen.

A Modest Room~
   This is a modestly sized single room, having but one entrance; 
a solid wooden door from the west. There is a small, 
terrace-style window on the southern wall which has a view of the 
top of a low building of some description. The outer walls are 
panneled with planks of lacquered pine wood, covering up the 
stone that constitutes the building's bulk. The floor is layed 
with a worn, heavily-scratched cedar, though appears to be in 
quite good state of repair. The walls are, for the most part, 
completely unadorned.

An Ancient Courtyard Before a Precarious Tower~
   Ancient in years, this courtyard may once have been a 
hospitable place. In its current condition, the cobblestones 
that make up the path which runs along the outer edges are 
smashed and covered with wreckage from above. In the center of 
the courtyard lies a huge boulder. To the north lies a 
dilapidated and precarious tower with a wide cracked base, its 
bronze-domed top soaring high above and fire-damaged. A small 
dirt path, tangled with weeds, trails around the siege-ruined 
structure along its eastern wall. 
   The double doors that once barred access northwards now hang 
useless off twisted hinges. Signs of siege damage are everywhere 
- boulders, rocks, charred timbers.

A Narrow, Mostly Collapsed, Entry Hall~
   This entry hall was once wide enough to fit twelve men 
abreast, from wall to wall, but half of it has collapsed under 
the weight of fallen beams from above. Sconces still line the 
walls, but the torches are long gone. Upon the eastern wall a 
large rectangular clean area contrasts with the fire damage 
pervading the remainder of the hall as it stretches northwards. 
A strong, iron-banded door secures the entrance to the east. 
Double-doors lay swinging off shattered hinges to the south, 
leading out of the tower.

At the Top of a Grey Stone Stairwell~
   A twisted, wrought-iron staircase below merges with this broad 
stairwell, which exits openly into a room to the west and a 
hallway to the south. The walls and floor here, as with the rest 
of the tower, are hewn from grey stone ruined by fire and siege 
damage, lending the space a cold atmosphere and cloying air. A 
small, square window, glass long since shattered, is set into the 
wall east of the stairwell, overlooking the Anduin, and the ruin 
of a domed bridge. A stout door still sits alone in the northern 
wall.

A Long, Musty Armory~
   Racks of various sizes line the walls in this long, dimly-lit 
room. Everything is orderly and precise and nothing seems out of 
place. It is clear that the armory sees a fair deal of traffic, 
the room rarely lacking some form of activity. Glass lamps 
provide illumination, and a square door to the east leads back 
out into an entry hall. The lines of shelving continue to the 
south, towards the other half of the storeroom.

Burnt-out Common Room at the Base of the Tower~
   The collapsed entry hall to the south barely grants access 
into this broad square room, fashioned of sloping limestone brick 
turned black by fire. A wrought-iron staircase, in parts twisted 
and melted out of shape, climbs the northern wall, tunneling 
through the stone of the sooty ceiling above. A fireplace set 
into the eastern wall is piled with dead creatures. The tattered 
remains of cloth hang from rods set throughout the commons, 
depicting faded images of Ithilien's Full Moon, and the sword and 
moon heraldry of Lord Eradan. A blackened door is set into the 
wall to the west. 
   Above, the tower creaks and groans, as timbers and years of 
decay take their toll on this building, that seems ready to 
collapse at any moment and bury all inside.

uneven tile, padded with the occasional rug for comfort. The 
space is evenly divided by a series of bunk beds, draped in 
linens. A fireplace of arched stone commands the western wall, 
proffering heat, while sconced lamps of hazy glass, recently 
installed, offer bright illumination. Set in the northwest 
corner is a spiral stone staircase.

A Blackened Hall With A Holed Vaulted Ceiling~
   This small, rectangular hall is short in breadth but great in 
height, a swept ceiling of vaulted brick looming above the main 
floor, open to the elements in many places as great collections 
of rubble and fragments of boulders lay on top of crushed 
remnants of tables and burnt timbers. Two slender windows occupy 
the western wall, offering a bleak view of the ruinous city 
surroundings, and a slight glimpse of Anorien green beyond, along 
with the elements. The hall exits openly into a stairwell to the 
east, and a narrow space leads into a makeshift kitchen to the 
south. 
   The entire ceiling seems to shift and groan in high winds and 
the floor shudders.

north the hallway stretches forward, joining with an airy 
stairwell. Along the eastern wall a staircase of blackened 
wrought iron can be found, winding its way upward in a tight 
spiral through the masonry. The hallway is unadorned, and 
somewhat bleak, the walls cool to the touch and noticeably bare.

A Thin Dirt Path Around the Tower~
   This dirt walkway hooks around the corner of the tower. Any 
attempts to clean it have been utterly useless, as weeds have 
almost overtaken the path in it's entirety. The walls of the 
tower are made from stout, white granite which has become worn 
with the passage of time, and vines have already climbed up the 
stones. A small dirt path off to the east leads up to the wooden 
door of a newly-built, two-story building.

to the west. While it appears that there have been attempts to
paint the trapdoor black, the paint has since flaked off,
revealing the stout, twisted iron underneath. Two small, sturdy
log buildings are here to the north and east along the outer

northward a short distance. A slender door of plain, unpainted 
timber lies to the west, providing entry to a private chamber. A

weatherbeaten and indistinguishable. The wrought-iron staircase 
that winds in from below continues twisting upward here, ringing 
with the footfalls of occasional passerby.

   The pungent odor of mold assaults the nostrils as one enters

   The grey brick walls of this small, square room are hung with

black shield. In spite of its size, the room is well attended, 
bordered by plain beds and a fireplace with a low wooden mantle. 
A large rectangular rug sits beneath the furniture, above a floor 
of chill stone. The room's roof slopes upward into a peak, an

Gondor's White Tree in silver filigree, set just beneath the 
cloudy surface of the stone. A desk is pushed into one corner of 
the space, littered with papers, positioned across from a series 
of beds, each placed beneath a slender arrow slit turned glass 
window. The western wall is unadorned, save for a deep carving 
of some ancient Gondorian symbol, bordered in worn tengwar 
sigils. A tall oaken door set into the eastern wall exits out 
into a passageway.

At The Base of the Bell Tower~
   The base of a large bell tower unfolds here, the sweeping 
walls of curved grey stone supported by a network of oaken beams 
and coiled ropes. A heavy bell of bronze, slightly rusted, sits 
within the wooden net, held by firm by a thick chain and strung 
with a rope that dangles nearby, ready to be pulled. The bell 
tower is closed and windowless, the atmosphere damp and musty. 
The top of a wrought-iron staircase winds downward nearby, 
leading into the lower depths of the tower proper. A second 
staircase of wooden planks hugs the curving wall of the 
enclosure, leading upward. On both the east and west walls, a 
narrow archers slit slants downward sharply, providing a view of 
the walls.

At the Top of an Ancient Tower, Overlooking a Ruined Osgiliath~
   This windswept tower platform sits at the very apex of the 
tall structure, the roof sloping upward into a conical dome, 
plated with dull bronze. Stone arches lift the detatched dome 
above a cracked railing, offering ample space to glimpse a 
commanding view of the ruin of old Osgiliath. To the east runs 
the river Anduin, churning about the blackened limestone brick of 
a collapsed Dome of Stars. In all other directions the gray city 
stretches, roads, paths and alleys choked with rubble and 
scorched debris. In the distant western horizon, on a clear day, 
a slope of green can be spied, marking the beginning of an 
unscathed Anorien.

A Rubble-Strewn Alleyway, at the Entry to a Support Bridge~
   A narrow alleyway cuts past the timeworn faces of grey stone 
buildings, the uneven cobbles strewn with rubble. To the west 
the alleyway joins with a black-cobbled road, which can be 
glimpsed through the ruins of a collapsed structure. To the east 
the alleyway meets an open gateway, the iron bars rusted and the 
hinges torn. The gateway opens out onto a thin, crumbling 
support bridge that crosses the wide blue of the Anduin River. 
   A shattered wooden tower lays across part of the path, swept 
westwards of its foundations before crashing to the ground it 
seems.

A Shattered Support Bridge, Above the Anduin~
   This slender bridge, its grey flagstones lightly spotted with 
moss and lichen, is intended for limited traffic only. It 
presses on to the west here, its edges lined with an ancient, 
engraved stone railing, where it ends at a torn gate, joining 
with a narrow alleyway. It halts abruptly eastwards, an entire 
section of bridge now laying underwater just in sight. Over the 
railing the Anduin can be seen, the water turning to white foam 
about the bridge supports. 
   Northwards the wretched fallen pillars and limestone blocks of 
the once mighty Bel-iant bridge can be seen. Some of the 
supports still jut proudly upwards on either side of the vast 
expanse on the Anduin. A great ship lays shattered towards the 
western side of the riverbank.

   This slender bridge, intended for limited traffic only, 
presses on to the east and west here, its edges lined with an 
ancient, engraved stone railing. It carries on west and 
eastwards, its grey flagstones lightly spotted with moss and 
lichen. Over the railing the Anduin can be barely seen even with 
lamp or torchlight, the water turning to white foam about the 
bridge supports. The river thunders underneath, and lanterns can 
be seen eastwards.

At the Bridge's Centre~
   This narrow support bridge has now thrust far over the 
Anduin's surface, proffering a commanding view of the horizon. 
To the north, the remnants of a vast dome of stone have been 
piled within the river's waters, a large bridge visible amidst 
the ruins. The bridge itself lies shattered, and collapsed at 
its centre. The support bridge presses on eastward and westward, 
where it eventually meets the distant Osgiliath shoreline on 
either side. 
   A large two storey structure rises to the east above a 
newly-built tunnel barring all other way across the bridge. Work 
is nearly complete here extending the tunnel westwards to this 
point. A set of wooden stairs ascend to the top of the tunnel. 
A small passage offers access to the side of the murder tunnel.

Reinforced Tunnel With Side Slits and Murder Holes~
   Within this new structure of stonework and raised reinforced 
beams, it is clear that the holes above and slits to either side 
are meant for for defence. Any passing through this wide tunnel 
face constant scrutiny when the side tunnels are manned. The 
river Anduin can be heard flowing underfoot. To the east the 
bridge tunnel lightly descends, meeting an alleyway beyond. A 
tower rises near the gates, access granted by a short gap between 
them and the tunnel.

Atop a Tower's Wooden Platform~
   Fashioned of sturdy oaken planks, this tower rises within the 
centre of an alleyway, proffering a commanding view of the 
surrounding ruin of the former city of Osgiliath, and a narrow 
support bridge to the east. The platform here is surrounded by a 
low wooden railing, and crowned by a slatted roof of wooden 
shingles, to provide shelter from the elements. A square hole is 
cut into the platform's centre, a wooden ladder hinged to one of 
the edges, providing access to the street below.

Within a Ruined Building, Turned Warehouse Floor~
   Sloping walls of stone create the boundaries of this building, 
the bricks that comprise them worn in some areas, and replaced 
with new material in others. The once failing structure has seen 
some new repair, converted now into a cramped warehouse. The 
packed earth floor is scattered with crates, boxes, bags and 
barrels of supplies, the double doors to the south flanked by a 
pair of unhitched carts. The space, though small, is cleverly 
managed, and is seemingly more than sufficient.

The End of a Passageway~
   A short passageway, illuminated by the flickering light of 
cloudy glass lamps along the eastern wall, meets its northern end 
here. The hallway is windowless and often cold, the walls 
unadorned, save for the presence of two tall oaken doors to the 
west and east. The doors are bolted with polished brass, and
each is engraved with the heraldry of House Eradan.

Inside a Rope-Walled Sparring Ring~
   This packed earth area is cleared recently, frayed rope 
ringing the area. There is no respite from the elements, though 
the rope walls allow for a calm breeze to pass through whenever 
the wind blows. About twenty paces across, there is ample room 
afforded in this space to participate in large or small 
engagements.

A Secure, Small Paymaster Office~
   This small, stone room has a chilly feel, possibly given by the
cramped space and the somewhat humid quality of the 
eastern wall. Although an effort to warm the room using a brazier
has been made, only someone quite close to it might be able
to warm noticeably. Light is purveyed by a rough, iron chandelier
set with tallow candles, and by several other, candles set over a 
simple, somewhat battered wooden desk. A sturdy, iron safe has 
been bolted to the ground in the north east corner, kept securely
closed at all times. The only exit is through a thick, iron banded
door to the west.

A Neatly Kept Barracks~
   The wooden floor underneath creaks and groans from the weight 
it bears, while the muffled sound of voices and snores alike echo 
up from the barracks below. Despite the noise, however, the 
barracks appears well furnished, with several rugs set upon the 
ground to help muffle the noise and still the cold. Along the 
west side a fireplace with a small hearth marks the wall, while 
the east is lined with a series of bunk beds. Draped upon the 
exposed stone walls are worn tapestries depicting images of 
heroic victories, while in the vaulted ceiling above, ancient 
Tengwar carvings and sculptures of warriors clad in mail are 
recessed into the brick.

Light is provided by lanterns set in the walls and a great stone

to sneak its way down the spiral staircase in the northern 
corner. Upon the east wall, illuminated by a pair of lanterns, 
hangs a well made tapestry bearing a black shield and a grey Full

In an Archer's Box Over the Courtyard~
   What may have once been an elegant balcony has now been 
transformed into a spartan archer's horde. Thick wooden planks 
line the sides of the railings, which reach to a man's waist, and 
the box remains uncovered from above. A curtain to the north 
leads back into the Tower, while a faulty step could send one 
plummeting to the courtyard below.

Nearing the Western Dock~
   The water of the Anduin here reaches to a man's thigh as water 
makes it's way downriver from north to south. This particular 
part of the river holds a slow, sluggish current, but further out 
it seems more prevalent as water rushes past fallen ruins and 
masonry.
   To the south, the massive ruins of the Dome of the Stars are 
clearly seen, while a path can be seen sloping up to the city, a 
large tower looming over it.

A Small Dock Extending From the Anduin Shoreline~
   The constant sound of rushing water fills this area as the 
River Anduin progresses downstream to the east. The River 
filters its way through the gargantuan ruins of what was once the 
Dome of Stars downstream. The path which winds its way up the 
hill to the south can be seen here, though in the direct vicinity 
high grasses grows to a man's knee, flowing with the wind 
whenever it blows. 
   A solid platform stretches out twenty feet into the river, 
with vertical shafts rising up in six places. A canopy of canvas 
is stretched above these poles, offering limited shelter from the 
weather. This small docking area is sturdy and contains many 
winches and iron looped poles, ropes stretching out in place and 
revealing this is serving as a ferry dock.

A Declining Path at the Base of a Wall~
   The high path hugs a thick granite wall here as it slinks its 
way down the hill, eventually leading down to the River Anduin 
far below. To the west lies the corner of a gutted tower, 
collapsed archer platforms and walkways jutting up just in view. 
To the east the river stretches away and the far bank of East 
Osgiliath can be barely seen on a clear day. 
   At the base of the hill the rubble of the Great Dome blocks 
any futher access as a vast collection of Dome limestone blocks 
and old pillars have collapsed, rising up in a great mass of 
destruction.

A Path Sloping Downward, from North to South~
   Running uphill from the south, this path manages its way from 
the River Anduin to the destroyed ruins of Western Osgiliath. 
The path provides a gruesome view of the remnants of the Dome of 
Stars to the east far below as it manages to barely hinder the 
progress of the Anduin. To the south remnants of a small complex 
can be seen, a collapsed burnt-out shell of a tower, as the path 
runs adjacent to it.

A Swiftly Sloping Path Following a Wall~
   The crumbling remnant of an old bridge is here, its cracked 
cobblestones becoming fewer and farther between as it meets the 
land. They end in a sort of worn path, which ambles northward, 
up the steep hill, closely hugging a granite wall. The bridge 
itself extends partly into the water, abruptly ending in the 
middle of the Anduin River.

The Northwestern Tower Top~
   Some half dozen paces in diameter, this tower top is flanked 
on all sides by stone ramparts - providing a defensive point from 
both the outside dangers and the rest of the tower. A hole in 
the ground provides access to a ladder, while a hatch beside the 
hole allows for the defenders to draw up the ladder and seize the 
hatch tight.

The Southwestern Tower Top~
   Some half dozen paces in diameter, this tower top is flanked 
on all sides by stone ramparts - providing a defensive point from 
both the outside dangers and the rest of the tower. A hole in 
the ground provides access to a ladder, while a hatch beside the 
hole allows for the defenders to draw up the ladder and seize the 
hatch tight. This tower in particular provides an excellent view 
of the surroundings, its slightly-sloping sides jutting out into 
the intersection to provide an excellent bowshot south and west.

Over the Gate~
   Kept under the vigilant gaze of the Battalion Armsmen, this 
segment of wall resides just above the arched gateway that offers 
access to Lord Eradan's Tower. Underfoot is a narrow walkway of 
granite flagstones, while ramparts of grey stone to the south 
protect the defenders from the missiles of any would be attacker.

Atop the Wall Overlooking the Anduin~
   Marked by a narrow catwalk guarded by stone ramparts, this 
pathway guards the tower's eastern flank - its gaze staring out 
over a narrow path leading down to the broken foundations of the 
great bridge. To the north and south, squat stone and wood 
towers support the wall, while on the west side the tower blocks 
passage.

A Narrow Catwalk~
   Tucked along the rear-facing tower wall, this narrow catwalk 
looks out over the northern slums of Osgiliath. Decrepit even 
before the Great Siege, the buildings are now little more than 
jagged, broken toothed looking rubble. To the south, a rickety 
looking plank bridge with rope guidewires allows entrance to the 
Tower. In high winds, the entire structure shakes and bricks and 
other debris fall to the ground below.

Atop a Tower's Wooden Platform~
   Fashioned of sturdy oaken planks, this tower rises from the 
base of the bridge gate, proffering a commanding view of the 
surrounding ruin of the former city of Osgiliath, and a narrow 
alley to the east. The platform here is surrounded by a low 
wooden railing, and crowned by a slatted roof of wooden shingles, 
to provide shelter from the elements. A square hole is cut into 
the platform's center, a wooden ladder hinged to one of the 
edges, providing access to the street below, while a stout wooden 
wall prevents looking westwards.

A Section of Pipe~
   This is a small tunnel, scarcely large enough for a tall man 
to stoop through, within a pipe. It curves north and east. The 
pipe is broken and cracked. To the north some chunks of masonry 
lay at the base of the pipe and a large opening is ahead. To the 
east fresh air can be smelt heavy with the richness of the river.

In the Breach~
   Here the greying limestone walls of the former city of 
Osgiliath have begun to collapse from war and decay. Great 
sections of wall hang overhead, ready to collapse at any minute 
it seems. The hole here is as wide as a wagon and Anorien 
countryside and the sound of the river harken to the north, 
whereas the foreboding narrow streets of the ruins lay to the 
south.

A Dilapidated Storm-Damaged Dockyard~
   At the base of a northward ascending steep and winding path is 
this old, abandonded dockyard. Large flat slabs of rock stretch 
out to form several piers, themselves extended by decaying log 
platforms. Most are now collapsed or rotten. An old stone 
dockmaster cabin is set under the rising cliffs, its roof caved 
in by timbers that have fallen from a crane. The flattened space 
that is not covered in lumber and wreckage offers enough room to 
load and unload crates at the nearest of the jetties. 
   The river bends slightly westward, and the opposite side can 
be seen on clear days. The cliffside blocks the way south and 
west of here.
