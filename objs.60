a tall, sigil-etched obelisk~
An obsidian obelisk etched with dark sigils rises up here, nearly touching the domed roof.~
   This obsidian, polished obelisk has been inscribed with 
columns and columns of twisting, curved, complex sigils. Each of 
its four faces that taper upwards are immaculately decorated with 
the symbols. The mammoth stone piece rises high up to the domed 
ceiling of the chamber.

A heavy chest with iron bandings sits here, a scythe-like sigil etched on to its face.~

chest which is gently curving itself. It has two locks on its 
left and right side. Predominantly, a strange sigil taking the 
shape of a scythe has been engraved on the face.

sentinel UNIQUE_KRAYD eyeless male STONE~
an eyeless, male stone sentinel~
An eyeless, male stone sentinel keeps eternal watch over the foyer.~
   This statue is almost twice the height of a typically-sized 
man, stretching well over ten feet into the air. The stonework 
itself is impeccable, depicting a broad-shouldered, robed figure 
still possessing the flower of youth, his garment's hood pushed 
back to expose a strong chin and high cheekbones. The face is 
marred only by the two gaping voids where eyes should have 
resided; the stone is carved out here, leaving a pair of empty 
hollows that gaze sightlessly forward, giving the sentinel itself 
a mixture of the beautiful and the macabre.

an eyeless, female stone sentinel~
An eyeless, female stone sentinel watches the foyer blankly.~
   This statue is almost twice the height of a typically-sized 
woman, stretching a bit over ten feet into the air. The 
stonework itself is impeccable, depicting a slender, robed figure 
still possessing the flower of youth, her garment's hood pushed 
back to expose full lips and a heart-shaped countenance. The 
face is marred only by the two gaping voids where eyes should 
have resided; the stone is carved out here, leaving a pair of 
empty hollows that gaze sightlessly forward, giving the sentinel 
itself a mixture of the beautiful and the macabre.

an eerily lifelike statue of a grim-faced, solidly-muscled man~
Central to the chamber is an eerily lifelike statue of a grim-faced, solidly-muscled man on a black marble stand.~
   This statue appears almost life-like in appearance, carven 
presumably from obsidian at one time or another. Now, the statue 
takes on an almost animate, debonair posture, cold eyes seeming 
to follow those who watch it. Upon closer inspection one can see 
the creases in his skin and the detail of his facial hair. The 
man depicted is wearing a plain high-collared shirt and 
tight-fitting trousers.

same material as the cushion and appear worn and dirty.
