Northeastern Bank of Two Rivers Merging~
   The powerful, surging waters of the Anduin flow by the 
riverbank to the west as they run north and south, while the pale 
waters of the Morgulduin from the east pour into the great river. 
The two rivers merge and continue flowing southwards in their 
journey to the distant ocean, a slight curve to the southwest 
visible on clear days. Reeds grow out amongst rocky outcroppings 
that have formed along the river's edge, and tufts of grass 
sprout from the ground nearby.

North of a Ruined Bridge Over Morgulduin~
   The bank of the river here is mostly barren with only the 
occasional bush or shrub brightening it up. The water of the 
river laps over pebbles and rocks immediately by the water's edge 
and as the bank leaves the water it slopes upward quite quickly. 
Few animals can be heard and even fewer can be seen, travellers 
here are basically nonexistent. 
   To the south, the beginnings of an old stone bridge rise above 
the Morgulduin, scorched by fire and ending suddenly.

   The pale waters of Morgulduin run in a generally northeast to

the river is barren mostly and in places broken with dirt and 
rocks falling into the water. Shrubs and grasses grow but only 
barely and mostly remain far from the waters edge. The sounds of

   The high stone walls of ruined Osgiliath, ragged and crumbled 
stonework, rise erratically upwards to the west here, and run 
from north to south, before curving back westwards towards the 
banks of the Anduin River. The land near the walls has become a 
treacherous bog, with small patches grass and dead trees 
scattered about. Some animals can be seen here though most flee 
when startled.

Healthy Countryside~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks.

   The immediate area is covered in small green and brown shrubs 
interspersed with yellowed dying grass as well as green and 
vibrant. The occasional tree provides shelter and homes for the 
wildlife here and the wind can be heard blowing through the 
hills. Not many travellers can be seen, most preferring the 
safer roads.

Healthy Countryside~
   All around can be seen the rolling hills of North Ithilien. 
The hills are often quite forgiving though occasionally sharp 
rocks or large boulders will interrupt the way. Grass grows 
among the rocks as well as among the small green and brown shrubs 
that also grow in the area only reaching a man's knee in height. 
Some trees can also be seen among the hills though not many.

Before the Collapsed Gate House to a Ruined City~
   The road continues to the east of here while to the west lies 
the remains of a collapsed gate house. The once might stonework 
forming a treacherous heap, preventing any further travel. To 
the northeast abandoned farmland stretches as far as the eye can 
see while to the south of the road a bog stretches before a 
ruined walls. The road itself seems to thin a little here and 
obviously has a tendency to be muddy when wet as the imprints of 
wagon wheels can be seen deeply ingrained into the road.

   The road runs both east and west from this point. Small tufts

the occasional smooth stone, which appear to have once been 
cobblestone, though from what time is anyone's guess. For the 
most part the road is made of packed dirt and is lined at the 
edges with tall grasses that come to the knee of a grown man, 
while tended fields stretch across the land to the north.

has been, over time, packed hard with the travellers of many 
centuries. The only sounds that can be heard in this area are 
the sounds of the weather and its effect on the grass beside the 
road or the occasional farmer in his field.

Lond Nirnaeth~
   The road continues east and west through the North Ithilien 
countryside. Northward, fertile fields of a predominantly wheat 
crop lie spread over the rolling hills. The road itself is 
little more than a well-defined dirt track which tends to be as 
wide as many city roads. In places tufts of grass can be seen 
growing in the middle of the path and along the edges the grass 
becomes knee length as it extends into the distance.

Lond Nirnaeth~
   From here Lond Nirnaeth runs both east and west cutting 
through the knee-high grasses north of Ithilien. The road is mainly 
composed of dirt that has been packed hard with centuries of 
travel. The land is generally flat with the occasional crest 
that seems to creep up on the unwary traveller. Boulders and 
rocks protrude in places to the sides of the road and seem like 
islands among the rippling ocean of straw-like grass.

which though not entirely green is long and appears healthy 
enough. The only sounds that can be heard in this area are the 
sounds of the weather and its effect on the grass beside the 
road. To the north, the burned, jutting wreckage of a windmill 
can be seen amidst the fields.

A Turn in Lond Nirnaeth~
   Curving here the road heads both west and north. The land on 
either side of the road becomes quite rocky here for a period 
with the road being slightly uneven as a result. In places it is 
obvious that at one point or another someone has tried to even 
out the road by cutting the rock for the most part however the 
road avoids entering rocky areas. Small tufts of grass seem to 
spring out of the rocks themselves, hanging over the edges of the 
road.

   The area here teems with the movements of small wildlife, even 
the occasional wolf loping through the area. The large fields 
that roam through the Ithilien here are untilled, empty 
farmhouses standing on the small hillocks, the bed of grass and 
weed-covered farming land occasional broken by a patch of scrubby 
trees, or faint remains of wagon trails leading through the land.

North Ithilien Farmlands~
   The immediate area is covered in untilled fields; while once 
there were no doubt many farmers working the land here, now weeds 
and other noxious growth cover once fertile plots. No fences 
partition the fields and the crops are either non-existant or 
rotting in the ground. Wild animals are few and far between in 
this place, not due to the human activity of working farmers but 
that of marching soldiers, the impressive sight of Osgiliath to 
the west further deterring wildlife.

North Ithilien Farmlands~
   Fields of differing varieties at differing stages of growth 
fill the area. Small wagon tracks are all that separate each 
field with no need for farmers to erect fencing. Animals can 
rarely be seen, preferring to remain at a distance from human 
activities. The wind can be felt and heard in the area quite 
often as some of the taller crops sway in the breeze.

North Ithilien Farmlands~
   Very few animals pass through this area probably due to the 
amount of human activity. Crops of varying types and sizes fill 
the immediate area and are separated by nothing more than wagon 
trails that provide access for farmers to their crops. In the 
middle of some of the fields can be seen trees, which rise out of 
the sea of the crops like a bushy island.

   The immediate area is covered in fields that have been 
separated by mere tracks so that farmers may get to their crops 
with wagons. No fences partition the fields and the crops are 
all at differing stages of growth. Wild animals are few and far 
between in this place as there is too often human activity in the 
area as farmers tend their fields or soldiers patrol the land.

Meandering Lond Nirnaeth~
   The road continues east and south as it cuts across the surrounding 
lands. Dry, tall grasses sway in the wind where they grow upon the 
riverbanks to the south, while farmlands and fertile fields stretch out 
to the west and north before a sprawling forest. The road itself is old 
and packed hard by centuries of people traveling along it, its dirt 
surface occasionally interrupted by a pothole or loose cobblestone. 
Standing a short distance to the west, the burnt-out hulk of a windmill 
can be seen occasionally, while to the north stands the remains of a 
burnt fort. A tall timber tower rises a short distance above the trees 
within the ruins. Tall, log walls starting to go up around it.

Lond Nirnaeth~
   Some light woodlands border the road to the north as it 
travels east and west. Tall grasses ripple across hilly lands to 
the south, approaching a river in that direction. The road is 
mainly composed of dirt that has been packed hard with centuries 
of travel. The land is generally flat with the occasional crest 
that seems to creep up on the unwary traveller. Tended fields 
are visible in the distance to the west, while drier hills rise 
and fall to the east. 
   To the northwest, a timber tower rises a short distance above 
the trees. Tall, log walls starting to go up around it.

Lond Nirnaeth~
   The road runs both east and west from this point. Small tufts 
of grass spring up in the road from time to time mingling with 
the occasional smooth stone, which appear to have once been 
cobblestone, though from what time is anyone's guess. For the 
most part the road is made of packed dirt and is lined at the 
edges with tall grasses. Woodlands stand to the north, while the 
distant sound of water rushing by indicates a river to the south.

A Curve in Lond Nirnaeth~
   Lond Nirnaeth curves west and north here as it meanders across 
the land in a northeast-southwesterly fashion. The road is 
mainly composed of dirt that has been packed hard with centuries 
of travel. The land is generally flat with the occasional crest 
that seems to creep up on the unwary traveller. Light woodlands 
start to the northwest, while grassy plains and a river can be 
seen on the other side of the road.

Northwestern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The bank of the river here slopes sharply into the water, 
which runs over rounded pebbles and rocks. Trees grow near the 
bank and sometimes roots stick out into the water. Grasses and 
shrubs grow here as well though mostly they seem to be dying and 
these are few and far between. The river is accessible though 
the slope is often slippery.

it slopes down into the river. The land closest to the water

   The bank of Morgulduin is quite barren, no grass grows and 
only the occasional bush or shrub manages to live, though they 
appear to be dying. Few animals can be seen, preferring to hide 
from travellers. A sturdy, narrow bridge, wide enough for a 
wagon, has been recently constructed at this point, enabling 
travel south, its entrance guarded by an archer's tower.

   The bank of the river here is mostly barren with only the 
occasional bush or shrub brightening it up. The water of the 
river laps over pebbles and rocks immediately by the waters edge 
and as the bank leaves the water it slopes upward quite quickly. 
Few animals can be heard and even fewer can be seen, travellers 
here are basically nonexistent.

Northwestern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The pale waters of Morgulduin bend in their course to the 
north and west, lapping against the rocky shore. The bank of the 
river is barren mostly and in places broken with dirt and rocks 
falling into the water. Shrubs and grasses grow but only barely 
and mostly remain far from the waters edge. The sounds of the 
wind, the occasional bird, and the water are the only ones that 
intrude upon this place.

Under the Shadow of Shattered and Broken Stone Walls~
   The high stone walls of ruined Osgiliath, ragged and crumbled 
stonework, rise erratically upwards to the west here, and run 
from south to north, before curving back westwards towards the 
banks of the Anduin River. The land near the walls has become a 
treacherous bog, with small patches grass and dead trees 
scattered about. Some animals can be seen here though most flee 
when startled.

A Curve in Lond Nirnaeth~
   Lond Nirnaeth curves gently to the south and east here as it 
meanders past a vast woodland region to the north. The road 
itself seems ancient, evidenced by what seem to be cobblestones 
that once may have been the mainstay of the road many years ago. 
Now however the road has become mostly a dirt track with tufts of 
grass attempting to gain a footing on the path.

Lond Nirnaeth~
   From here Lond Nirnaeth runs both east and west between two 
very different terrains. The dark brown and green trunks of an 
expansive forest rise to the north, while grassy hills and the 
pale waters of a river are visible to the south. The road is 
mainly composed of dirt that has been packed hard with centuries 
of travel. The land is generally flat with the occasional crest 
that seems to creep up on the unwary traveller.

Meandering Lond Nirnaeth~
   The road continues west and north as it cuts across the 
surrounding lands. Tall grasses ripple across the hilly plains 
to the south, before a pale river, while trees line the road 
where a large forest sprawls to the northwest. The road itself 
is old and packed hard by centuries of people travelling along 
here.

which runs over rounded pebbles and rocks. Trees grow near the 
bank and sometimes roots stick out into the water. Grasses and 
shrubs grow here as well though mostly they seem to be dying and 
these are few and far between. The river is accessible though

Northern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The bank of the river here is mostly barren with only the 
occasional bush or shrub brightening it up. The water of the 
river laps over pebbles and rocks immediately by the waters edge 
and as the bank leaves the water it slopes upward quite quickly. 
Few animals can be heard and even fewer can be seen, travellers 
here are basically nonexistent. The ground towards the east has 
been violently pushed skyward, creating a steep, stone escarpment 
that runs from the bank of the river northwards.

Northwestern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The pale waters of Morgulduin run to the west and north as the 
river rounds a slight bend, lapping against the rocky shore. The 
bank of the river is barren mostly and in places broken with dirt 
and rocks falling into the water. Shrubs and grasses grow but 
only barely and mostly remain far from the waters edge. The 
sounds of the wind, the occasional bird and the water are the 
only ones that intrude upon this place. The ground towards the 
west has been violently pushed skyward, creating a steep, stone 
escarpment that runs from the bank of the river northwards.

On the Flooded River Bank Against the Ruins of the City Walls~
   The high stone walls of ruined Osgiliath, ragged and crumbled 
stonework, rise erratically upwards to the south here, and run 
from east to west, before curving back southwards. The land near 
the walls has become a treacherous bog, with small patches grass 
and dead trees scattered about. Some animals can be seen here 
though most flee when startled.

Farmland on the Outskirts of a Forest~
   The land is covered in fields that have been separated by mere 
tracks so that farmers may get to their crops with wagons. No 
fences partition the fields and the crops are all at differing 
stages of growth. Wild animals are few and far between in this 
place as there is too often human activity in the area as farmers 
tend their fields or soldiers patrol the land.

Light Woodlands~
   The trees here are spaced apart in their growth, many still in

sway gently in the air, the sky fairly visible through them. 
Clumps of bushes, grass, and stones lie underfoot between the 
tree trunks, and a faint rustling can be heard now and then as a 
small creature darts between their cover.

Underfoot, the ground is a combination of grasses and clumps of 
low bushes, some no higher than a man's shin while others reach 
taller than the knee. The trees thin out to the south, and grow 
denser to the north.

Recently Logged Cedar Forest~
   Once a vibrant, young forest of cedar trees, the land here has 
been cruelly logged, stumps all about and long furrows in the 
ground where trees have been dragged away, all angled in a 
south-eastern direction where a large fort lies. To the west, 
the stumps end and the trees begin anew, while to the north the 
extent of the logging continues. Farmlands lie to the south.

A Clearing in the Woods Around Some Ruins~
   This area appears to have been cleared for farmland at one 
time, the stumps of trees skirting the edges while old furrows 
cut across the ground. The open sky can be seen from here with 
nothing to block it from view, though the surrounding forest 
presses in to the north and east. The land seems to have been 
abandoned for some reason, and fresh undergrowth and saplings 
have taken root where crops used to grow. 
   A black smudge is sprawled across the centre of the clearing, 
large furrows of land where it appears many heavy things have 
been dragged leading to the southern walled settlement.

   An old road moves on to the east, its western progress blocked 
by a steep stone escarpment. The westerly ground hasbeen

the old road consists mainly of grassland, which seem dry but 
obviously persists in life. The road itself seems ancient

Harad Road on the Banks of the Morgulduin~
   The road continues to the north while to the south it ends at 
the pale waters of the Morgulduin before a collapsed bridge of 
yellowed bones and twisted brambles. The banks of the river here 
are rocky and barren, no grass grows beneath the boulders or in 
the crevices that line the side of the water. Seldom can 
travelers be seen using this road, the black peaks of the Ephel 
Duath rising ominously a distance to the east.

Northern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The pale waters of Morgulduin run in a generally east to 
westerly direction lapping against the rocky shore. The bank of 
the river is barren mostly and in places broken with dirt and 
rocks falling into the water. Shrubs and grasses grow but only 
barely and mostly remain far from the waters edge. The sounds of 
the wind, the occasional bird and the water are the only ones 
that intrude upon this place.

Northwestern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The bank of Morgulduin is quite barren, no grass grows and 
only the occasional bush or shrub manages to live, though they 
appear to be dying. Few animals can be seen preferring to hide 
from travellers. The bank is occasionally broken though mostly 
it slopes down into the river. The land closest to the water 
mostly consists of pebbles and small rocks.

Eastern Bank of the Anduin~
   The riverbank here is slightly broken in places with small 
rises following the water. Rocks and boulders rest everywhere 
here and the occasional tree shadows the ground creating a bare 
patch where leaves have fallen over the years amongst the grass. 
Animals of the ground and birds can often be heard though mostly 
not seen as they avoid contact with people.

Logged Cedar Forest~
   Once a vibrant, young forest of cedar trees, the land here has 
been cruelly logged, stumps all about and long furrows in the 
ground where trees have been dragged away, all angled in a 
south-eastern direction where a large fort lies. To the north 
and west, the stumps end and the trees begin anew, while to the 
south the extent of the logging continues. Farmlands lie to the 
east.

A Large Clearing in the Woods~
   This area appears to have been cleared for farmland at one 
time, the stumps of trees skirting the edges while old furrows 
cut across the ground. The open sky can be seen from here with 
nothing to block it from view, though the surrounding forest 
presses in to the north and west. The land seems to have been 
abandoned for some reason, and fresh undergrowth and saplings 
have taken root where crops used to grow.

   The trees here are spaced apart in their growth, many still in

sway gently in the air, the sky fairly visible through them. 
Clumps of bushes, grass, and stones lie underfoot between the 
tree trunks, and a faint rustling can be heard now and then as a 
small creature darts between their cover.

   The land here is dotted with trees of varying types, shapes,

Underfoot, the ground is a combination of grasses and clumps of 
low bushes, some no higher than a man's shin while others reach 
taller than the knee. The trees thin out to the south, and grow 
denser to the north. The ground towards the east has been 
violently pushed skyward, creating a steep, stone escarpment that 
runs from the south to the north.

   The road runs east and south from this point while a 
well-trodden path leads up a hill to the north. Grasslands 
border the road in a sea of knee-high browns and greens being dry 
and straw-like. Occasionally animals wander out onto the road 
though they run when startled by travellers. The road itself is

Lond Nirnaeth~
   The land to either side of the road here could be called

cracked, as is the road as it continues east and west from here. 
To the west the land seems to become more fertile, to the east 
however the land seems only to become more barren. The sounds of 
animals are absent and travellers seem to be few and far between.

   The road continues both east and west from here through what

degrees of health manages to keep a foothold in this otherwise 
unhospitable land. The road is mostly dry and in places the odd 
clump of grass shows that life still persists.

The Crossroads~
   This place, known as the crossroads is where Lond Nirnaeth the 
road running east and west from Osgiliath and Minas Morgul 
crosses the Harad Road, the road heading north and south through 
Ithilien. The road has fallen to disrepair for the most part, 
though some remembrance of the men of Gondor remain where stones 
that were once the main element of the road can be seen amongst 
the packed dirt.

Lond Nirnaeth East of a Crossroads~
   The road travels along an incline, sloping upward through the

crossroads. Ever looming on the eastern horizon are the 
saw-tooth peaks of the Ephel Duath, a black mountain range that 
casts a shadow across the land. Despite signs of falling into 
disrepair, this road still maintains a straight and wide path, 
though its surface is pitted with potholes and old, loose 
cobblestones.

A Turn in Lond Nirnaeth~
   The road begins to meander here, going north and west as it 
runs next to the bank of the Morgulduin. The lands on the 
northern side of the road are quite barren with very little in 
the way of grass and quite a bit of rock. The road itself is dry 
and in places small tufts of grass attempt to bring life to this 
desolate place but fail miserably as they are brown and dry 
themselves.

   The rocky ground is cracked and broken, and littered with 
loose, dark gray and black stones that often shift and slide, 
making travel across them hazardous. To the east, huge mountains 
are visible, looming over the terrain, and the barren land rises 
sharply to meet them them. There is no sign of plant or animal 
life, only the long-dead skeletons of dessicated trees.

A Stand of Trees Bordering the Anduin~
   The river's flow shifts in direction here, turning very 
slightly to the northwest and southeast in its broad north-south 
course. Tall, deciduous trees grow in the vicinity, casting a 
shade over the land in the warmer seasons. The ground is clear 
of any thick underbrush, though a layer of old leaves is 
constantly underfoot. A few patches of sky can be glimpsed 
between the swaying boughs of the treetops above.

the wildlife here and the wind can be heard blowing through the

A Well-Trodden Trail South-East of a Fort~
   The path continues both north and south. To the northwest can 
be seen a huge mound of rubble and broken walls of a once 
powerful fortification upon a hill. To either side of the road 
in the immediate area grasslands roll over the top of hills, 
which sweep into the distance in all directions. The sound of 
the wind among the grass is the most dominant sound here.

Northern Ithilien Hills~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks.

Harad Road~
   To the north and south the road continues through the plains 
of this land, over rolling hills and down quiet valleys. The 
road is well defined and mostly made of dirt that has been packed 
hard over the centuries. To either side of the road the plain 
continues into the distance and to the far east can be seen 
mountains looming above, casting ominous shadows across the land.

North Ithilien Dry Plains~
   The terrain is rocky, with very little vegetation and no sign 
of animal life. Boulders dot the landscape, and jagged, dark 
gray and black stones litter the ground, occasionally shifting in 
small, tumbling landslides. The mountains of Ephel Duath loom to 
the east, stark and black, with the ground rising sharply to meet 
them.
   The area is covered with thousands of crude tents and numerous
orkin of all kinds. Several hasty pits and trenches have been cut
into the rocky terrain around a large clearing in
at the heart of the vast encampment.

Meandering Lond Nirnaeth~
   Curving here the road moves both south and east. The land to 
either side of the road consists mainly of dry and barren 
grasslands. The road itself seems ancient evidenced by what seem 
to be cobblestones that once may have been the mainstay of the 
road many years ago. Now however the road has become mostly a 
dirt track with tufts of grass attempting to gain a footing on 
the path.

Lond Nirnaeth Climbing Sloped, Dry Plains~
   The ancient, dirt-packed road of Lond Nirnaeth runs up and 
down a steep slope as it draws near a break in the basaltic 
mountains that form the otherwise unsurpassable Ephel Duath to 
the east. Barren, rocky plains spread to the north and west, 
while to the south flow the sickly pale waters of the River 
Morgulduin as it cuts across the land. A dead silence generally 
pervades over this area, broken only by the occasional clack of 
loose stones sliding downhill.

A Stand of Trees Bordering the Anduin~
   The trees here grow right to the water's edge, the roots of 
those on the riverbank tapping down into the Anduin as it flows 
past. A variety of oak, maple, and ash trees share this grove, 
their leaves in the autumn time creating a conglomeration of 
fiery colors. Old, fallen leaves from previous years litter the 
otherwise brush-free ground. The river traveling north and south 
makes a constant, soothing sound of rushing water.

A Stand of Trees~
   Some tended farmlands are visible to the south, while a large 
forest that dwarfs this small grove stands east of here. Tall, 
deciduous trees grow in the vicinity, casting a shade over the 
land in the warmer seasons. The ground is clear of any thick 
underbrush, though a layer of old leaves is constantly underfoot. 
A few patches of sky can be glimpsed between the swaying boughs 
of the treetops above.

Underfoot, the ground is a combination of grasses and clumps of 
low bushes, some no higher than a man's shin while others reach 
taller than the knee. The trees thin out to the west, and grow 
denser to the east.

another, their branches touching here and there. The undergrowth 
consists mainly of low bushes of green and brown that reach no 
higher than a man's shin though some reach higher than the knee. 
From above leaves occasionally fall, littering the ground with 
decaying vegetation as the seasons pass.

Ominous Clearing Around an Ancient Fir~
   A huge, twisted fir tree mars this patch of woodlands. Its 
warped, uneven branches almost seem to be reaching out to snatch 
at the other firs and cedars unlucky enough to grow within its 
grasp. Strangling the main trunk of the disfigured fir is a 
thick vine, forcing it to curve back downward before ending in a 
lightning-split blackened peak. A wide hole near the end of the 
dead vine completes the illusion of two writhing serpents locked 
together.

Hilly Woodlands~
   Some animals can be seen passing through this area, though 
they are shy and avoid contact with any who are near. Trees 
shadow everything though none block the sky fully as the area is 
only light woodland. The ground is littered with dead leaves 
that have decayed over time and the soil is mostly moist 
displaying small shrubs everywhere.

Hilly Woodlands~
   The sky can be seen filtering through the branches of the 
trees in this woodland area. The trees are tall and though some 
seem to be dying others are full of life. Animals can be heard 
scurrying through the undergrowth occasionally and the wind 
rustles the leave of the trees. Small shrubs grow everywhere and 
occasionally a rock pokes through the undergrowth.

Recently Logged Woodlands Far West of a Fort~
   The land here is dotted with trees of varying types, shapes, 
and sizes as it gradually shifts from countryside to woodlands. 
Underfoot, the ground is a combination of grasses and clumps of 
low bushes, some no higher than a man's shin while others reach 
taller than the knee. To the east, the trees thin out 
considerably quickly, many jagged stumps of logged flora visible 
there. Further to the east, a fort can be seen, constructed in 
the shell of an old stone ruin.

West of a Huge Sink Hole~
   These lands appear to have been tended fields at one time, but 
they now show no signs of human inhabitation. Overgrown grasses 
and scraggly weeds cover the relatively flat ground, interspersed 
with an occasional twiggy bush. The wind can be felt and heard 
in the area quite often as some of the taller grasses sway in the 
breeze. The grounds falls away to the east, a gaping sink hole 
with ragged edges lying here.

East of a Huge Sink Hole~
   The path continues to the south while to the west lies a huge 
sink hole with rubble and stone, the remains of what was once a 
fortification of some sort. The road itself seems to roll down 
the side of a hill as it heads southward. In all directions 
hills can be seen grown wild. Few if any people can be seen in 
this area, the gaping hole to the west offering a foreboding air. 
The ruined stone frame of a gate hangs here, to the west a huge 
sink hole slowly filling with water.

Scrubby Grasslands East of a Stone Fort~
   The immediate area is dotted with small, green and brown 
shrubs and a mixture of yellow and pale-green grasses. The 
occasional tree provides shelter for the wildlife here and the 
wind can be heard blowing through the hills. Not many travelers 
are seen, most preferring the safer roads. The hills grow more 
pronounced to the east, while a well-trodden trail cuts through 
the grasslands to the west. Past the trail a battered stone fort 
rises up.

Rolling Hills~
   All around can be seen the rolling hills of North Ithilien. 
The hills are often quite forgiving though occasionally sharp 
rocks or large boulders will interrupt the way. Grass grows 
among the rocks as well as among the small green and brown shrubs 
that also grow in the area only reaching a man's knee in height. 
Some trees can also be seen among the hills though not many.

Harad Road~
   To the south and north the road continues through the plains 
of this land, over rolling hills and down quiet valleys. The 
road is well defined and mostly made of dirt that has been packed 
hard over the centuries. To either side of the road the plain 
continues into the distance and to the far east can be seen 
mountains looming above, casting ominous shadows across the land.

Northern Ithilien Dry Lands~
   The landscape is dark and bleak, with only a few sparse 
patches of long-dead vegetation. Loose grey stones litter the 
ground, occasionally shifting in slides of tumbling rock. Rising 
to the east are the jagged outlines of stark black mountains. As 
far as the eye can see, the terrain is barren, descending 
slightly to the west.

   The ground is cracked and broken, and littered with loose dark 
gray rock that shifts and slides occasionally. To the east, 
huge, stark black mountains are visible; the land rises slightly 
as it approaches them. There is no sign of plant or animal life, 
only the long-dead skeletons of desiccated trees. Boulders dot 
the landscape, standing out amongst the smaller stones.

Barren Hills of the North Ithilien~
   Jagged gray and black rocks are everywhere; occasionally, 
loose sections of ground shift and tumble west, where the land 
slants downward. Looming to the east are huge mountains, looking 
just as desolate as the nearby terrain. There is no sign of 
plant or animal life. Scattered here and there are the cracked 
and desiccated remains of long-dead trees. The flank of a 
mountain of the Ephel Duath rises up at a steep slope, hemming in 
the lands to the north and east.

A Stand of Trees Bordering the Anduin~
   Tall, deciduous trees grow in the vicinity, casting a shade 
over the land in the warmer seasons. The ground is clear of any 
thick underbrush, though a layer of old leaves is constantly 
underfoot. A few patches of sky can be glimpsed between the 
swaying boughs of the treetops above. To the west, the great 
River Anduin flows by a rocky bank in its north-south course.

A Stand of Trees~
   A shaded grove of trees rises up from the surrounding 
countryside, continuing to the west and south. A variety of oak, 
maple, and ash trees grow here, their leaves in the autumn time 
creating a conglomeration of fiery colors. Old, fallen leaves 
from previous years litter the otherwise brush-free ground. 
Hilly countryside spreads to the north and east, though the tops 
of a much larger forest can be seen further eastward. The ground 
beneath the northern edge of the stand of trees is sunken and 
collapsed.

Hilly, Cedar Woodlands~
   While an occasional fir tree spots this section of the forest, 
the woodlands here are composed of older cedars formed together 
to create an impregnable canopy overhead. The cedars grow 
straight and tall, with no branches lower than the height of two 
men combined. The ground is soft and generally moist, patterned 
by the evidence of several mushroom patches; most of the 
mushrooms themselves have actually been picked off by various 
animals, some of which can be seen darting behind trees.

Scrub-Dotted Hills North-West of a Huge Sink Hole~
   The immediate area is dotted with small, green and brown 
shrubs and a mixture of yellow and pale-green grasses. The 
occasional tree provides shelter for the wildlife here and the 
wind can be heard blowing through the hills. Not many travelers 
are seen, most preferring the safer roads. The hills grow more 
pronounced to the east, while a gaping sink hole lies just to the 
southeast.

Clearing North of a Huge Sink Hole~
   These lands appear to have been tended fields at one time, but 
they now show no signs of human inhabitation. Overgrown grasses 
and scraggly weeds cover the relatively flat ground, interspersed 
with an occasional bush. More trees grow to the northwest, where 
the beginnings of a forest are visible. The ground falls away to 
the south, a gaping sink hole with ragged edges liying there.

Scrubby Grasslands Northeast of a Massive Sink Hole~
   The terrain here is a wild, uninhabited land that spreads out 
to the west and south, a hard-packed dirt road hemming it in the 
other directions. Low hills spaced one after the other are 
covered by tall, straw-like grasses that bend and rustle in the 
wind. The land being relatively flat, one can get a good view of 
the surrounding countryside from atop one of these hills. A 
ruined stone fortification lies to the southwest, while a steep 
mountain range is within sight far to the east.

   These lands appear to have been tended fields at one time, but 
they now show no signs of human inhabitation. Overgrown grasses

with an occasional twiggy bush. A large mound of rubble and ruin 
looms a short distance to the west atop a hill, while a wide road

Harad Road~
   The road meanders a little here, traveling generally north and 
east through the plains of this land, over rolling hills and down 
quiet valleys. The road is well defined and mostly made of dirt 
that has been packed hard over the centuries. To either side of 
the road the plain continues into the distance and to the far 
east can be seen mountains looming above, casting ominous shadows 
across the land.

   To the west and south the road continues through semi-arid 
grasslands. The yellow stalks of the straw-like grass bends in 
the wind as it crosses these plains. To the far east in the 
distance mountains rise up ominously, black clouds shadowing the 
sky. The road itself is surprisingly well trodden, made mostly 
of dirt but well defined with only a very few clumps of grass 
trying to live in the centre.

   Jagged boulders protrude from the earth, their rough surfaces 
black and crumbling. Littering the ground are dark gray and 
black rocks which shift easily, creating the occasional 
landslide. The land slopes upwards as it goes east, to meet the 
feet of the Ephel Duath mountains. The desiccated branches of 
long-dead trees are visible here and there.

   The landscape is dark and bleak, with only a few dead, 
desiccated trees amongst the boulders. Loose grey stones litter 
the ground, occasionally shifting in slides of tumbling rock. 
Rising to the east are the jagged outlines of stark black 
mountains. As far as the eye can see, the terrain is barren, 
sloping downward as it goes west. 
   The basaltic, near-vertical slopes of the Ephel Duath rise up 
directly to the east and north.

   The riverbank here is slightly broken in places with small

Animals of the ground and birds can often be heard though mostly

North Ithilien Countryside~
   All around can be seen the rolling hills of North Ithilien. 
The hills are often quite forgiving though occasionally sharp 
rocks or large boulders will interrupt the way. Grass grows 
among the rocks as well as among the small green and brown shrubs 
that also grow in the area only reaching a man's knee in height. 
Some trees can also be seen among the hills though not many. 
   A set of worn wagon-tracks pass through the hillside, turning
north and east as it borders some trees.

managed to find a way to survive here and long gnarled roots 
extend out searching for more water. Few animals can be heard in

not much water in the immediate area. Grass grows in patches 
mostly and small shrubs occasionally manage to find a perchance 
in the dry ground. Animals can rarely be heard or seen and the 
most obvious sound is the wind with few other sounds intruding up 
on the area. 
   The imposing Mountains of Shadow rise from the land not far to 
the east, cutting off all hope of travel in that direction.

At the Collapsed Gates~
   The tall, thick wooden gates that once guarded this ruined 
village lie collapsed, having brought down much of the wall on 
either side with it. All around, ashes and blackened wood litter 
the ground, while to the east the rickety frame of a building 
remains partially standing. New growth has sprouted up over the 
seasons, scraggly grasses and bushes poking out of the rubble.

Amongst the Ruins of a Building~
   All that remains of this structure is a rough framework of 
charred wood beams. Though it sways precariously with a strong 
passing wind, it has managed to resist collapsing entirely. The 
roof and most of the walls now lie on the ground, a mess of 
cobblestones, thatching, and ashes. From here, the rest of the 
village can be viewed as a desolate, flattened landscape.

Clearing Surrounding a Stone Well~
   There is a dampness to the air that is more pronounced than 
elsewhere in the village, in this secluded corner where two walls 
meet and a stone well stands in the center of a clearing. Grass 
and weeds grow underfoot while some thorny scrubs protrude from 
various spots in the ground. To the south, a very large pile of 
debris marks where a fair-sized building collapsed.

A Bend South of the Commons~
   The dirt path takes a sharp turn here as it runs into some 
sort of clearing to the north. Lining the path are burned-out 
husks of dwellings, only a few remaining standing. A dead 
silence hangs in the air here, as does the faint scent of ash.

The Village Commons~
   Tufts of grass sprout out from the ground here and there 
amidst the debris of this roughly square clearing, appearing to 
once be the village commons. A tall pile of broken wood and 
shards of glass to the north indicate where a building once 
stood. Surrounding this area to the east and west are the 
collapsed remains of dozens of huts, with no discernable path 
through them.

the area and provide natural shelter for animals. Birds of all 
varieties come to rest on the shore of mighty Anduin as it flows 
south towards the sea, to drink and feed amongst the long 
grasses.

shrubs growing everywhere. Grass sometimes grows here in patches 
though not very often. Some animals can be heard among the 
undergrowth but they are rarely seen avoiding contact with

   The trees here are spaced apart in their growth, many still in

Clumps of bushes, grass, and stones lie underfoot between the 
tree trunks, and a faint rustling can be heard now and then as a 
small creature darts between their cover.

   The road meanders a little here, traveling generally north and

quiet valleys. The road is well defined and mostly made of dirt 
that has been packed hard over the centuries. To either side of 
the road the plain continues into the distance and to the far 
east can be seen mountains looming above, casting ominous shadows 
across the land.

sky. The road itself is surprisingly well trodden, made mostly 
of dirt but well defined with only a very few clumps of grass 
trying to live in the centre.

extend out searching for more water. Few animals can be heard in

Northern Ithilien Dry Lands~
   This hilly landscape rises and falls quite gently, in places 
however the land has cracked and fallen creating small cliffs 
though none very large. Grasslands mostly fill the area though 
the grass is mostly patchy, dying shrubs of green and brown can 
be seen covering the ground. Few noises intrude upon the 
immediate area, animals avoiding the place. 
   The basaltic, near-vertical slopes of the Ephel Duath rise up 
directly to the east and south. A large, round boulder is set in 
the face of the mountain.

   The mighty River Anduin flows past these riverbanks to the 
west going from north to south. The land near the river is quite 
fertile with grass growing and water birds making their homes 
among the reeds that grow near the water. The bank slopes gently 
from the west and the waters edge and rises slightly towards the 
east. Some animals can be seen here though most flee when 
startled.

Northern Ithilien Countryside~
   All around can be seen the rolling hills of North Ithilien. 
The hills are often quite forgiving though occasionally sharp 
rocks or large boulders will interrupt the way. Grass grows 
among the rocks as well as among the small green and brown shrubs 
that also grow in the area only reaching a man's knee in height. 
Some trees can also be seen among the hills though not many. 
   A set of worn wagon-tracks pass through the hillside, traveling
north and south.

Light Woodlands~
   The land here is dotted with trees of varying types, shapes, 
and sizes as it gradually shifts from countryside to woodlands. 
Underfoot, the ground is a combination of grasses and clumps of 
low bushes, some no higher than a man's shin while others reach 
taller than the knee. The trees thin out to the west, and grow 
denser to the east. A small cabin sits nestled amongst the trees.

North Ithilien Woodlands~
   Some animals can be seen passing through this area, though 
they are shy and avoid contact with any who are near. Trees 
shadow everything though none block the sky fully as the area is 
only light woodland. The ground is littered with dead leaves 
that have decayed over time and the soil is mostly moist 
displaying small shrubs everywhere.

North Ithilien Woodlands~
   This area is filled with trees creating a woodland region. 
The trees are varying in species and all seem old beyond memory. 
The ground is covered in small green and brown bushes that sprout 
out of a layer of fallen leaves from seasons past. Light filters 
through from above, only partially blocked by leaves and 
branches.

North Ithilien Woodlands~
   The sky can be seen filtering through the branches of the 
trees in this woodland area. The trees are tall and though some 
seem to be dying others are full of life. Animals can be heard 
scurrying through the undergrowth occasionally and the wind 
rustles the leave of the trees. Small shrubs grow everywhere and 
occasionally a rock pokes through the undergrowth.

North Ithilien Woodlands~
   Only a few faint patches of sky can be seen through the 
overhanging branches and leaves above. The thick tree trunks are 
covered in soft green moss, and stand close together. Small 
rocks nestle between gnarled roots, and the occasional rustle of 
foliage indicates movement in the surrounding bushes.

Hilly Woodlands~
   The terrain here becomes hilly, generally increasing in slope 
to the east while decreasing to the west. The landscape is 
filled with trees of varying types, shapes and sizes. Low, brown 
and green bushes make up the undergrowth, ranging in height from 
that of a man's shin to higher than the knee. From above leaves 
occasionally fall, littering the ground with decaying vegetation 
as the seasons pass.

In a Small, Bowl-Shaped Clearing~
   A patch of tall fir trees with wide, expansive branches grows 
around a small indentation in the ground. Some of the larger, 
older trees have collapsed, leaving vast, rotting logs that 
mingle with cracked grey boulders to obstruct any direct travel 
through the forest. A plethora of squat bushes grow among the 
decaying piles of leaves and on top of the dead monolithic 
giants.

Thick, Hilly Woodlands~
   The land about this area is uneven and dotted with trees and 
low shrubs. Gnarled roots cover the ground, and small boulders 
lie amongst the leaves. Long tendrils of moss hang down from the 
upper branches of the trees, their tips disappearing into the 
undergrowth. The forest stretches on in every direction as far 
as the eye can see.

tall, ancient trees, their massive trunks rising like pillars

occasional forest creature rustles about in the undergrowth. 
Gnarled roots and small rocks, covered by leaves and lichen, are

lichen, are nestled amongst the gnarled roots, and clumps of 
fallen leaves have gathered in the crevices. Forest creatures

A Woodland Glade~
   A small clearing exists here, surrounded by tall and broad 
trees. Long grass grows from the ground, rippling with the 
occasional passing breeze, and patches of wildflower sprout up 
here and there. The ground is soft underfoot, and light filters 
through in patches between the foliage overhead. Clumps of moss 
and fungus cling to the gnarled, dark brown roots of nearby 
trees.

"Thin Woodland Fringe Near a Road"~
   Thin woodlands to the west begin to give way here to drier 
terrain, visible in the form of rocky foothills spreading 
eastward towards the Ephel Duath. A few copses of pine trees dot 
the land while the ground is fairly clear of tangling brush. 
Directly to the east and beyond the line of trees, a wide, 
hard-packed road runs across the lands.

Harad Road Bordering a Forest~
   The road continues north and south through grasslands which 
seem to become ever more dry and arid as it heads towards the 
mountains that loom in the distance to the east. The road is 
mostly made of dirt though occasionally a stone juts out, 
resembling what might have once been cobblestones. An increasing 
number of trees to the west mark the beginnings of a forest.

A Grove of Pine Trees Upon the Hills~
   Rising from the hills with straight trunks are numerous pine 
trees, spreading their needled boughs close enough to touch one 
another. The air is filled with the fresh scent of pine, and a 
soft layer of gold, brown, and green needles lies upon the 
ground. Set in the southern face of one of the hills is a 
crumbling hollow. To the east the hills and plains become drier, 
while a wide road borders this woodland to the west.

Ledge on the Western Face of a Mountain~
   A narrow outcropping of basaltic rock juts from the mountain 
face here, creating a ledge dozens of feet above the ground. 
There is nothing but solid rock to the east, as the unforgiving 
mountains of the Ephel Duath shoot skyward at a very steep angle. 
Westward lies an excellent view of the North Ithilien landscape, 
dry plains immediately below giving way to a broad dirt road 
snaking north and south, and a vast forest dominating the region 
beyond.

Along the Anduin South of a Fortified Township~
   As the River Anduin courses southward, a small fortified town 
is visible to the north where it is set a short distance back 
from the eastern shoreline of the river. The riverbank is 
slightly broken in places with small rises following the water. 
Rocks and boulders lie strewn about, and the occasional tree 
casts its shade across the ground. 
   A set of worn wagon-tracks from the east makes a turn 
alongside the river and continues northward to the township.

North Ithilien Countryside~
   The immediate area is covered in small green and brown shrubs 
interspersed with yellowed dying grass as well as green and 
vibrant. The occasional tree provides shelter and homes for the 
wildlife here and the wind can be heard blowing through the 
hills. 
   A set of worn wagon-tracks pass through the hillside, turning 
west and south. A small fortified township can be seen nearby to

Light Woodlands~
   Some animals can be seen passing through this area, though 
they are shy and avoid contact with any who are near. Trees 
shadow everything though none block the sky fully as the area is 
only light woodland. The ground is littered with dead leaves 
that have decayed over time and the soil is mostly moist 
displaying small shrubs everywhere.

Clumps of bushes, grass, and stones lie underfoot between the 
tree trunks, and a faint rustling can be heard now and then as a 
small creature darts between their cover.

   The land about this area is uneven and occupied with trees and 
low shrubs. Gnarled roots cover the ground, and small boulders 
lie amongst the leaves. Long tendrils of moss hang down from the 
upper branches of the trees, their tips disappearing into the 
undergrowth. The occasional rustling indicates a forest creature 
moving through the foliage.

mountain range. To the northeast, a rough road runs about the 
mass of logged trees.

straight path north and south through the forest, its dirt 
surface hard-packed from centuries of travel.

   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks.

landscape. Strewn about the area are jagged stones which shift 
occasionally in small, tumbling landslides. There is no sign of 
plant or animal life; a few bare, skeletal trees are visible, 
their cracked trunks and desiccated branches indicating that they 
died long ago. 
   As the land begins to slope steeper, an outcrop of rocks are
visible - piled up in a large, rough circle.

Sloped Woodlands of the North Ithilien~
   Tall, thick-trunked cedar trees climb an increasing slope that 
rises to the east, their branches and leaves obscuring most of 
the sky. Green and brown bushes grow in clusters between the 
trees, rustling now and then with a passing breeze or the 
movement of a small animal. Traveling up the incline is made a 
little bit difficult by the fairly thick undergrowth in this 
area.

low-growing shrubs, is soft and loamy. The slope continues 
rising to the east and descending in the opposite direction, 
crowded with trees and plantlife that grow increasingly closer 
together. Overhead, the sky is visible in patches between the 
foliage of the woodland canopy.

Sloped Woodlands of the North Ithilien~
   The scent of resin drifts through the air, borne upon passing 
breezes between the solid trunks of fir and cedar trees that grow 
on these sloping lands. Patches of ferns and mosses sprout up 
between the exposed, weathered roots of the trees, creating a 
patchwork of greens and browns over the earth. There is no 
discernable path through the fairly thick underbrush except at 
random twists and turns.

Sloped Woodlands of the North Ithilien~
   The air here is more damp than in other areas of the forest, 
as is evidenced by the smell of earthy humus filling the air. 
However, no open water source is to be seen. The underbrush is 
an often thick mass of large plants and small, whip-thin young 
trees, forcing the traveler to push through dense thickets. 
Several large bay trees have their trunks nestled into the low 
places here, while smaller cedar and fir once again predominate 
on higher ground to the east.

A Curve in Harad Road~
   The broad, dirt-packed road meanders on to the northwest and 
southeast, cutting a wide swath through the land. To the south 
and west, a large forest of pine, cedar, and fir draws nearer, 
while the clear waters of a stream visibly flows downhill to the 
north. Ever looming on the eastern horizon are the black, high 
peaks of the Ephel Duath mountains.

North Ithilien Dry Plains~
   The land here is quite dry and unwelcoming of travelers with 
not much water in the immediate area. Grass grows in patches 
mostly and small shrubs occasionally manage to find a perchance 
in the dry ground. Animals can rarely be heard or seen and the 
most obvious sound is the wind with few other sounds intruding up

Climbing an Increasingly Steep, Barren Slope~
   The land slopes upward as it goes east, crumbling and cracked 
in places due to the lack of moisture. Some clumps of grass and 
an occasional stunted shrub have managed to find footing in this 
inhositable terrain, the only growth here that breaks the 
monotony of the landscape. Underfoot, shifting rocks and loose 
soil make traveling a rather arduous task.

   Cutting a channel across the dry plains here is a fast-flowing 
stream that runs downhill to the northwest, originating from a 
waterfall over the high mountains to the east. The banks of the 
stream appear to support some more plant growth than the 
surrounding terrain, patches of pale green wildgrass and wiry 
scrubs sprouting up along the water's edge. The land continues 
sloping downward to the west, where a vast forest is visible.

A Waterfall Under the Shadow of the Mountains~
   A clear waterfall plunges down from the jagged edge of a 
mountainside, forming a rapidly flowing stream that snakes down 
the steep incline that descends to the west and northwest. The 
land here is barren, save for a few hardy plants clinging to the 
bank of the stream, and comes to an abrupt end as it slopes 
upward to the east to meet the Ephel Duath mountain range. All 
is silent except for the rush of water and blowing of wind.

Woodlands Southeast of a Stream~
   Over grainy stones and rounded pebbles flow the rapid, clear 
waters of a stream to the northwest. The trees of the

and green ferns sprouting from the soft earth over the water. 
Woodlands continue in all directions, growing denser to the east

North Ithilien Woodlands~
   The sound of flowing water drifts clearly across the air, 
thought its source is not visible amidst the abundant foliage of 
the surrounding woodlands. Rising up all around are the stiff, 
rough-barked trunks of fir trees, their branches and green 
needles beginning about half a dozen feet off the ground. Thick 
bushes grow in between the trees, rustling occasionally. 
   Cutting a path through the otherwise difficult underbrush is a 
faint, dirt trail that winds to the east and south.

Woodland Trail South of a Stream~
   Following the gently curving banks of this rapid stream is a 
narrow, dirt trail. Both to the south and to the north, across 
the gurgling waters, rise the tall, resinous trees that make up 
most of the extensive North Ithilien forest. There is a crisp 
quality to the air here, cool drafts from the fresh stream water 
mingling with the strong scent of cedar that permeates the 
surrounding area. 
   The trail continues, bending roughly to the east and west.

Harad Road South of a Shattered Bridge~
   Harad Road stops northwards as the old bridge has been swept 
away it seems. Grasslands and plains lie on either side of the 
road to the west and east, fertile to the west and increasingly 
barren to the east. Bordering the stream and grasses to the west 
are the beginnings of of a huge forest that spans most of the 
North Ithilien.

"South-East of a Wooden Bridge in North Ithilien Dry Plains"~
   The land here rises and falls gracefully in a hilly landscape 
along the bank of a rapid stream to the north. Here and there 
grass grows and the occasional small shrub manages to poke 
through the mostly dry land. The odd tree has also managed to 
find a way to survive here and long gnarled roots extend out 
searching for more water. Few animals can be heard in this place 
and even fewer can be seen, the sound most prevalent being the 
wind.

At the Foot of a Rocky Bluff Between Two Streams~
   Two streams, one to the north and the other to the south, flow 
downhill to the west, presumably merging at some later point. 
The view is obscured by a high, rocky bluff that sits in between 
the two moving bodies of water. Built at the top of the cliff is 
a stone fortress with a ruined tower. This area appears to have 
been the site of a battle some time ago, a number of rocks along 
the ground stained with old blood.

   Visible beyond the straight pine tree trunks to the west is a 
pair of streams that rush toward either side of a flat-topped 
cliff, atop which is a ruined stone fortress and tower. Some 
pine trees of varying stages of growth are spaced out here, their 
branches touching only in some places. The ground is mostly

A Curve in Harad Road South of a Bridge~
   Harad Road connects here to a wooden bridge, crossing a small 
winding stream just to the north. The wide dirt road isn't too 
commonly used, and has definitely seen better days, as is evident 
by the sickly weeds that have begun enroaching on the sides of 
the path. It is still easily navigable as it curves from the 
bridge towards the southeast, dodging between boulders and the 
occasional scrub. Another stream is visible at a distance to the 
south.

Meandering Harad Road~
   The dirt road forms a sharp turn around a massive boulder as 
it stretches from a wooden moss-covered bridge to the northwest 
to another bridge to the south. Harad Road is a wide path, but 
it is evidently very old, and is partially covered by the grasses 
invading from the surrounding meadows. Several lone bushes dot 
the low grassy hills just by the road, while to the east, a 
barren wasteland leads up to a craggy point protruding from the 
massive cliff-face.

At the Foot of the Ephel Duath~
   Directly to the east rise the impassive, basaltic faces of the 
Ephel Duath, blocking off all travel except a near-hopeless climb 
straight up. The ground is dry and broken, and littered with 
loose, dark gray and black rocks that shift and slide 
occasionally, making travel across them hazardous. There is no 
sign of plant or animal life, only the long-dead skeletons of 
desiccated trees.

relatively firm underfoot, although the bank grows muddier as it

Harad Road North of a Wooden Bridge~
   The road continues north and south, uninterrupted by a stream 
in its path directly to the south as it crosses the waters over a 
wooden bridge. Grasslands and plains lie on either side of the 
road to the west and east, fertile to the west and increasingly 
barren to the east. The stream flows downhill to the northwest, 
disappearing behind a towering fortress perched atop a high, 
rocky bluff on the horizon.

Sloped, Dry Plains North of a Stream~
   Cutting a channel across the dry plains here is a fast-flowing 
stream that runs downhill to the northwest, originating from a 
waterfall over the high mountains to the east. The banks of the 
stream appear to support some more plant growth than the 
surrounding terrain, patches of pale green wildgrass and wiry 
scrubs sprouting up along the water's edge. The land continues 
sloping downward to the west, where a vast forest is visible.

Barren Slopes North of a Stream~
   Set along the shore of a stream, this slope is barren and 
lifeless. The only sound comes from the stream that rushes by to 
the south. Sparse vegetation lines the edge of the stream, some 
roots showing along the stream's bank. A lone tree sits perched 
precariously over the stream, strong roots holding it in place. 
The slope itself is covered in loose dirt and stones, creating 
some unsteady footing for those that travel it. The odd hole can 
be seen along it, perhaps a burrow or den for some small 
creature.

Foothills of the Ephel Duath~
   The rocky landscape is broken up in sharply rising and falling 
hills that often form small cliffs, slanting ever higher as it 
tumbles onto the foot of the Ephel Duath's mountains to the east. 
An occasional stunted, pale-trunked tree finds holding here, 
grasping at the often loose soil with its gnarled roots and 
growing at a tilted angle. Few animals can be heard in this 
place and even fewer can be seen, the sound most prevalent being 
the wind.

Foothills Beneath the Ephel Duath~
   Directly to the east rise the impassive, basaltic faces of the 
Ephel Duath, blocking off all travel except a near-hopeless climb 
straight up. The ground is dry and broken, and littered with 
loose, dark gray and black rocks that shift and slide 
occasionally, making travel across them hazardous. There is no 
sign of plant or animal life, only the long-dead skeletons of 
desiccated trees.

   The stream winds down this slope at a rapid flow, curving 
slightly to the south from here. In the distance to the west, a 
rickety wooden bridge can be seen crossing over its waters. A 
few tufts of dying grass grow along the bank, among the few signs 
of life out here. The ground is covered in a layer of loose, 
crumbly soil interspersed with dark-hued rocks.

Barren Slopes South of a Stream~
   This slope is covered with a layer of loose, gravelly rocks 
that vary in colour from black to grey. The rare sprouting of 
grass or scrub poke through the rock, most mainly gathered along 
the bank of a stream to the north. A pair of long dead trees 
stand along the slope, a matured creeper vine coiled amonst the 
myriad of dead branches. The slope is silent, save for the 
sounds of the passing stream as it splashes against the rocky 
bank.

Broken Wooden Bridge Crossing a Stream, Far north of the Crossroads~
   Old, wooden planks have been nailed together to form a low 
bridge over the fast-flowing stream below. A rickety railing is 
mounted on both sides of the bridge, generally preventing a fall. 
To the north and south Harad Road unfurls, while a tower fortress 
is visible amongst the treetops to the northwest. The sound of 
rushing water is quite loud as it passes under the bridge, 
amplified as it echoes against the wood.

upward occasionally, leaving its surface damp and cool. Planks 
of cedar wood, weathered over the ages, have been pieced together 
to form a walkway that curves upward near the center. The stream 
flows westward, down a sharply descending slope until it reaches 
the broad waters of the River Anduin visible in glimpses between 
the leafy foliage of surrounding trees.

A Dirt Trail Leading North of an Aged Wooden Bridge~
   The grass in this area has been trampled low by many feet, 
forming a rough dirt path that winds outward from the wooden 
bridge over the tributary to the south. The vegetation here is 
lush and elaborate, fed by the many run-offs of the clear 
tributary nearby. The trees, though sparse nearby, grow ever 
thicker to the northeast, making travel in that direction more 
difficult. 
   A trampled dirt trail winds its way north toward the woodlands,
and south across the bridge.

Eastern Bank of the Anduin at a Tributary~
   A wide tributary stream flows its way rapidly down the sloping 
lands of the North Ithilien forest from the southeast, dumping 
its waters into the River Anduin. The great river to the west 
meanders its way north and south over the lands, its clear waters 
shimmering. Grass grows along its banks, interrupted by rocks 
and the occasional small boulder.

Charred trees and bushes cover this incline, the vegetation blackened
by a fire so ferocious that nothing seems to have grown back - no green
tendrils amidst the results of some mighty conflagation, just ash
and blackened husks and trunks. This rocky slope rises perhaps twenty

forest spreads as far as the eye can see. The climb appears less steep 
here than in other places, offering a series of ledges and old 
rockfalls along with thick vegetation.

   Straight-trunked fir trees rise from the earth like pillars, 
spreading their foliage dozens of feet above to cast a mottled 
shade upon all else. The sound of flowing water is faintly 
audible, though it is all but concealed by the rustle of leaves 
in the underbrush and occasional bird calls. Continuing in all 
directions are the extensive tracts of the North Ithilien 
woodlands. 
   A trail winds between the trees to the east and west.

Wooded Slopes of the North Ithilien~
   The ground underfoot, where not choked by tangled vines and 
low-growing shrubs, is soft and loamy. The slope continues 
rising to the east and descending in the opposite direction, 
crowded with trees and plantlife that grow increasingly closer 
together. Overhead, the sky is visible in patches between the 
foliage of the woodland canopy. 
   A trail, clear of underbrush, bends north and west.

Wooded Slopes of the North Ithilien~
   The scent of resin drifts through the air, borne upon passing 
breezes between the solid trunks of fir and cedar trees that grow 
on these sloping lands. Patches of ferns and mosses sprout up 
between the exposed, weathered roots of the trees, creating a 
patchwork of greens and browns over the earth. There is no 
discernable path through the fairly thick underbrush except at 
random twists and turns.

A Growth of Young Trees on a Rise~
   The land rises onto a small knoll where it continues ascending 
to the east and lower grounds lie to the west. This area appears 
to have been the victim of fire in the past, with old char marks 
on the rocks and surrounding older trees. A fresh growth of 
young cedar and fir scrambles to fill the cleared land, pushing 
their thin trunks skyward while competing for space with their 
needled limbs.

Charred Woodlands Along the Edge of a Cliff~
   Charred trees and bushes cover this incline, the vegetation 
blackened by a fire so ferocious that nothing seems to have grown 
back - no green tendrils amidst the results of some mighty

drop lies to the south where the land slopes down suddenly, 
falling away to continued forest in that direction.

   Over grainy stones and rounded pebbles flow the rapid, clear 
waters of a stream to the north. The trees of the surrounding 
forest thin out along its banks, only a few saplings and green 
ferns sprouting from the soft earth over the water. Woodlands 
continue in all directions, including the opposite bank, and grow 
denser to the south. A faint and constant roar of falling water 
echos downstream from the east.

Woodland Trail South of a Stream~
   Following the gently curving banks of this rapid stream is a 
narrow, dirt trail. Both to the south and to the north, across 
the gurgling waters, rise the tall, resinous trees that make up 
most of the extensive North Ithilien forest. There is a crisp 
quality to the air here, cool drafts from the fresh stream water 
mingling with the strong scent of cedar that permeates the 
surrounding area. 
   The trail continues south into the forest and turns east to 
follow the stream.

   Visible to the east is a clear, tumbling waterfall that drops 
over the edge of a high cliff, surrounded by lush vegetation. 
Its churning waters create a constant roaring sound along with 
spray that keeps everything in the immediate area damp and cool. 
The dirt on the trail underfoot is soft and springy, its dark 
brown hue contrasted by the vibrant green ferns that sprout along 
its edges. 
   The trail rises sharply to the east as it climbs the cliff, 
and descends to the west along the stream.

Bend in a Trail at the Top of a Cliff~
   The muffled sound of a waterfall seems to emanate from the 
north, and the stone cliff wall that rises in that direction 
fairly hums with the waters that pass behind it. Vibrantly green 
plants sprout from the cracks and nooks of the naturally formed 
walls on either side of this trail. The rough-hewn steps turn 
southward abruptly as they reach the top of the cliff, opening 
out onto a flat plateau of trees and grasses. 
   
   A bridge made of rope and planks leads to the north from the 
edge of the cliff, over the rising mist of the waterfall far 
below. It sways slightly in the wind.

plunges downward to the south. There, it seems to descend 
westward at a faster rate than at the top of the slope, creating 
the beginnings of a cliff edge that cuts through the trees. More 
open woodlands continue to the north, while a second slope rises 
eastward at a near right angle to the first.

Open Woodlands at the Edge of a Cliff~
   Tall cedar trees grow here with enough room for two persons to 
walk abreast between their thick trunks. Remarkably, the ground 
at this elevation is clear of any thick underbrush, with 
feathery-leaved ferns sprouting here and there instead. The 
cliff edge winds onward to the north, breaking at irregular 
intervals, while a sudden drop lies to the west.

End of a Slope in a Small Canyon~
   Naturally formed cliff walls, covered in hanging moss and 
brambles, rise up in all directions except to the west where the 
forest continues. There appears to be an opening in a corner of 
the rock, though it is obscured by dense thicket. The only sound 
here is that of the wind through the leaves and the occasional 
bird call, though this space gives all noise a slightly echoic 
quality.

Inside a Small, Blackened Cavern~
   This cavern is large enough only for perhaps two or three 
persons to fit inside comfortably, its low ceiling requiring most 
to stoop while under it. Its rough walls are dry and bits of 
rock crumble away to the touch. Black soot covers the ceiling 
and walls, and combined with the ash-covered ground, is evidence 
to a large fire which consumed most of the cave.

climb, its rocky surface often slick in places where clumps of 
moss grow. Some hand and footholds jut out at various angles, 
and a number of hanging vines provide temporary aid in scaling or

Dirt Trail Following the Edge of a Dense Wood~
   This area is filled with trees creating a woodland region. 
The trees are varying in species and all seem old beyond memory. 
Covering the ground are small, green and brown bushes that sprout 
out of a layer of fallen leaves from seasons past. Light filters 
through from above, only partially blocked by leaves and 
branches. 
   A trampled dirt trail winds its way north and south among the

A Thin Forest at the Border of a Tributary~
   A sparse grove of trees grow here, the dense forest to the 
north thinning out as it approaches the edge of a thin, clear 
tributary that bends from east to south. The grass and earth of 
the woodland floor gives way to a pebbled shore, muddied and held 
together by a loose layer of silt. A noticeablely large oak tree 
sprouts near the stream's north side, extending its gnarled 
branches over the water. A beaten path is visible to the west, 
winding parallel to the woodland's edge.

the sound of rushing water. A series of jagged rocks part the 
river's surface, worn smooth on one side by the Anduin's swift 
current, creating a web of swirling eddies and bubbling rapids. 
The shoreline is clear and generally devoid of trees, overgrown 
by low-lying shrubs and thick brambles instead. A rocky shore 
dominates the western edge, sloping downward to join with the 
river.

Path Amidst a Stand of Trees~
   The beginnings of a dense forest grow here, as a collection
of oaks, ash and birch converge, growing thicker to the east
and north. Surfaced roots are surrounded by sparse shrubs, 
green-leaved during the summer, a collection of bone white 
branches during the winter. The churning of the Anduin river 
drifts in from the west, filling the woods with the soft,
ceaseless song of water.
   A trampled dirt trail winds its way north and south among
the trees.

A Mixed Wood of Birch and Oak~
   Towering ranks of birch and oak are aligned haphazardly here, 
their bulbous roots creating an uneven forest floor. The ground 
is blanketed by a layer of tall, wild grass, and a sparse 
collection of shrubs. The branches of the trees intersect above, 
creating a relatively thick canopy of intertwined wood that 
blocks out the daytime sun. Moss grows in abundance on the 
trunks of the oaks, sloping down to their roots seamlessly.

leaving a large open bank of smooth stones spotted lightly with 
lichen and moss. Tufts of grass sprout out from the gaps between 
the shoreline's rocks, growing thicker as they converge and meet 
along the forest's edge. To the east, through a stand of 
saplings and dying oaks, a winding dirt trail is visible. The 
river is remarkably wide here, and glimmers as it flows, casting 
a soft light over the shoreline during the day.

   The trail from the south grows wider here and is better

into the earth. The odd tree interrupts the trail, casting a 
looming, shadowed visage over the uneven path. Willows grow in 
abundance to the east, mixing with trees of differing species in 
the denser sections of the forest. To the west, through a series 
of gnarled oaks and birch saplings, the mighty Anduin can be 
glimpsed, flowing steadily southward. 
   A trampled dirt trail winds its way north and south among

A Worn Dirt Trail East of Tall Log Walls~
   A narrow path, deeply rutted by the recent passage of many 
heavy wagons, pushes east and west through a clearing between a 
small cove in the eastern bank of the River Anduin and an 
expansive meadow. Westward, the trail ends at the gate to a 
walled village that has been built on the rocky edge of the 
Anduin's eastern shore. The stout wooden gates enables entry to 
a tall wall constructed of treated, sharpened logs and farmland 
to the south. A ways to the east the pressing bulk of the 
forested Ithilien is noticeable, just to the east of where the 
trail branches to the north and the south. The sound of the 
rushing Anduin is ever-present here, filling the rocky shore with 
noise. 
   To the south and stretching eastward a tall palisade of 
sharpened logs stand.

A Clearing at the Edge of a Small Cove in the Bank of the Anduin~
   A thin woodland trail from the south passes close to the edge 
of a small cove in the bank of the Anduin. it curves to the east 
as its northward progress is made impossible by the increasingly 
thick growth of wet woodland. The forest grows incredibly close 
to the trail here, trees of mixed origin casting a random pattern 
of shadows over the clearing in the daytime. The surface of the 
path is fairly slick and is covered in thick moss, overgrown in 
some locations by wild grasses and forest brush.

Dirt Trail Running Between a Dense Wood and an Ancient Forest~
   The forest here has been folded back by the curving length of 
a trodden dirt path, the course of the trail snaking west to 
east. The woodland grows thicker to the north and south, ranks 
of birch and willow dominating the countryside. Signs of 
wildlife are present here, and the path, poorly maintained, is 
being devoured slowly by the forest, seemingly pulled downward 
into the earth. The roots of trees cross over the trail at 
certain intervals, slowing travel.

A Mossy Forest North of a Small Cove in the Bank of the Anduin~
   The woodland here grows thick and dense, and is often wet 
during the warmer months of the year. The earth is thick with 
brush and dotted with fallen logs, overrun with moss. To the 
west the wet forest ground yields to the flow of the Anduin, 
leaving an earthy cliff with a stone base that rises dramatically 
upward from the river's breadth. A cobblestone path can be spied 
to the southeast, along the edge of a small cove in the river 
bank.

Amidst a Forest North of a Dirt Trail~
   Ranks of moss-strewn oaks dominate this section of the 
Ithilien, thinning to the south where an intersection of 
cobblestone paths is somewhat discernible through the 
low-stretching boughs. A collection of crumbling stones, 
seemingly shaped by hammer and chisel, lie strewn about this 
section of the forest, blanketed now by lichen and plant growth.

In the Thick of a Wet Woodland~
   Trees of varying sizes grow here, their bulky roots webbing 
across the forest floor, covered in mossy growth wherever 
visible. The leaves of the forest brush are slick with dew 
during most month's of the year, granting a sweaty heat to the 
heart of the woodland. A narrow dirt trail winds its way closer 
to the forest to the south, barely visible through the density of 
the trees and bramble.

Thinning Woodlands~
   The thick denser forest to the south begins to divide here. 
Many trees have fallen, their crumbling logs now blanketed by 
vegetation and thick moss. The ground begins to grow moist 
underfoot, and it yields a wider variety of plant growth, from 
scraggly wildflowers that bloom in the spring and summer months, 
to bulky, leafy brush. To the west the Anduin can be spied, its 
blue-green form bending sharply to the northwest.

Wet Forest~
   The ranks of trees to the south thin here as the thick 
woodland of the North Ithilien gives way to an open, 
thickly-vegetated countryside. The remaining trees here are 
dominated by swaths of moss and lichen, and are surrounded by a 
variety of deeply rooted, bushy plants. The air here is granted 
a distinct earthy smell, and the soil beneath is remarkably dark 
and wet. A cobblestone path is just barely visible to the south.

Amidst Scattered Trees~
   This stretch of the Ithilien is open and only lightly dotted 
by trees and larger plant growth. Stones jut out from the 
woodland floor at certain intervals, their sides awash with the 
flow of a small stream that empties into a murky pool at the 
centre of a clearing. Surrounding the pool is an array of ferns 
and reeds, and at the water's surface there floats a thick 
collection of blue-green algae. Signs of wildlife grow less 
noticeable here, and the woodland is generally quiet.

Along a Bend in the Anduin~
   The mighty Anduin curves to the northwest. Its shores are no 
longer rocky and strewn with stone, but are comprised of loose 
earth overhangs, held together by the roots of sparse, knotted 
trees and wild vegetation. The land rises upward here before 
sheering dramatically downward to meet with the river's surface, 
broken by some landings and narrow rocky outcroppings on the way. 
This height grants a clearer view of the Ithilien to the east.

Scattered Woods on a Rise South of a Damp Heathlands~
   The land slopes gently upward here, climbing to reach the apex 
of a low hill before rising dramatically to a tall rock 
outcropping. The Anduin can be heard and seen from this rise in 
the countryside, as can the tip of a large, wooded island to the 
south. The transformation of the tree-filled Ithilien is very 
noticeable from this vantage point as well - to the north the 
sparse woodlands are consumed by the bulk of the wetlands located 
there, fading into a swath of heath and bog before eventually 
joining with the bulk of a marsh.

Near Murky Pools Amidst Thinning Forest~
   The ground here is damp, and the woodland floor is seperated 
by a series of murky pools, cloudy streams connecting each of 
them to form a web of glassy water. The trees begin to thin out 
towards the north, and many of those have shrunken. They have 
grown blackened and appear dead, serving as vessels for the 
growth of new, thriving vegetation. A distinct earthy smell is 
discernable in the air, and the atmosphere is wet, filled at 
times by the fingers of low-lying fog.

thick moss. The ground is moist underfoot, and it yields a wider 
variety of plant growth, from scraggly, browning wildflowers to 
bulky, leafy brush. A series of murky pools dot the earth, 
surrounded by reeds and ferns and awash in lily pads. Traveling 
to the north the ground grows more firm, very gradually rising as 
one walks along.

sparsely admist the confines of a wet bog. Ferns and rushes grow 
in abundance, choking off other vegetation. Pools of black water 
devour the earth, surrounded by thick reeds and rugged stones 
slick with moss. A solid bridge of ground, blanketed in yellow 
grass, winds its way through the heathland, heading northward 
where the bog continues.

Before A Ramshackle Old Hut In The Forests~
   Hidden in the most condensed area of the North Ithilien forest,
a small hut stands in a gap between the trees that is barely large
enough to hold the it. Upon four low stilts it stands, raised above
the thorny undergrowth just two feet. The hut itself is made from
rough, semicircular lumber and looks extremely old and barely 
safe. The roof seems to be thatched from straw, though much grass
and weeds and mould grows in it also, hiding the yellowy colour.
A small set up rickety steps with one handrail rise to the 
awkwardly hanging door.

Sentry Point Atop the Tower~
   Leading up from below through a trapdoor, this wooden landing 
atop the tower provides a magnificent view of the surrounding 
countryside. There are no walls, only stout oaken beams leading 
upward to a conic shaped roof, which provides some protection 
from the elements. Wooden planks are nailed to the support beams 
at waist level, providing some protection, though not a lot, to 
one toppling over. From high above the Ithilien, one can spot a 
thick forest to the northeast, framed by jagged snow peaked 
mountains further east. To the south a cliff rises in the 
distance, and the lands to the west are held fast by a wide 
river.

heavy catapult fire. The center of the battlements has crumbled

ground far below, coming to a half-circle gap in the battlement. 
The gap is about ten yards across and the ledges on either side 
are cracked and jagged showing where they have recently broken 
off and fallen. The northern wall has been smashed down and the 
rubble there leads down into the top of the slope of rubble 
below, but the northern side is too steep to climb up. The area

a solid dirt ground has taken its place, and the windows have 
been boarded over so that only tiny cracks of light trickle in 
from outside. The air here is stuffy, but the room itself is 
empty, a ladder on the eastern side leading up to a hay loft 
above, while in the center of the floor there is a gaping hole 
several feet wide leading into the earth. Wood chippings are 
scattered over the floor and stacks of chopped wood fill one

   This ledge sits high in the wall of the eastern side of the 
barn, and though it appears sturdy enough there is no railing to 
prevent the fall off the edge from the perilous height. There is 
a layer of hay upon the floor and room for several people to lie 
comfortably here. A sturdy ladder leads to the ground far below.

A Vertical Tunnel~
   This tunnel into the earth goes up and down in a vertical 
cylinder wide enough for a large man to move comfortably, a 
sturdy wooden ladder stuck upon the hard earthen walls lining its 
length, which extends from the opening above down into the 
darkness below. The air grows cooler and damp the further down 
one goes, wooden planks reinforcing the dirt walls of the tunnel 
at various increments.

Dark Hallway~
   Damp and musty smelling, this hallway is very dark and 
uninviting. The moist, slimy stone walls absorb any light that 
manages to trickle into the room. Huge uneven blocks of rough 
stone form a patchwork floor, and irregular stone arches support 
the low ceiling. A large hole in the ceiling can be accessed by 
means of a sloping mount of dirt, leading upward.

A Lush, Tended Park~
   Past the large intricate gate is a very well tended lush park. 
At the entrance it leads to a wide dirt path outlined by 
dark-hued wood chippings with billowing hosta plants planted 
every few feet. The outlying area is strewn by articulate, 
flourishing gardens giving off the sweet smell of roses, lilacs, 
and lilies, as well as an assortment of other bright colored 
flowers and bushes. The smooth dirt path leads to a single bench 
in front of a large weeping willow tree, the path spliting off to 
both sides at the bench.

A Flourishing Park Area~
   Down the smooth dirt path, it leads to an oval shaped plot of 
packed together dirt, wreathed by an arch of various flower 
bushes and gardens. There are several marble benchs in a 
semi-circle along the outside of the oval-shaped plot, the 
flourishing bushes a mere few feet behind.

An Open Area Before a Lake~
   The dirt path leading towards a lake broadens into an open 
area surrounded by well-kept, trimmed bushes. There are several 
large trees behind the wide array of bushes, complimenting the 
are nicly. There is a large lake with crystal clear water off to 
the south.

In a Glistening Clear Blue Watered Lake~
   This lake has crystal clear blue water which glistens brightly 
in the sunlight. The water is a clean, crystal blue color and is 
rather deep on the south end. Small groups of fish can be seen 
swimming around in small schools under the water.

Underwater at the Southern End of a Lake~
   The air in the tunnel is thick and there is the lingering 
scent of fresh soil. The ground is rather flat, though is bumpy. 
The walls and ceiling curve around in an arch. It is wide enough 
to fit a few people across, though not many. There are torches 
placed along the tunnel to provide just enough light to see.

Along the Cliffside~
   A path wide enough for three people to walk comfortably 
abreast spans out here, leading from the sheer rise upward toward 
the base, where the mighty Anduin flows. It levels out about 
halfway down, some dozen feet from the Anduin, where it widens to 
a flat panel of smooth rock and dirt, giving space for several 
people or animals. In the cliff face opens a cavern's mouth, as 
wide as the path and tall enough to let all but the tallest of 
humans stand at full height.

A Cavernous Room~
   This cavernous area is somewhat shallow, carved out of the 
rock by the Anduin in times passed. It is nearly eight feet high 
in many parts, no stalactites nor stalagmites breaking its smooth 
interior. Indeed, the floors, walls, and ceiling are worn 
smooth, enclosing a space nearly twenty-five feet long and twelve 
feet wide. The only break in the walls is southward, where they 
open toward the cliffside.

Rubble-Strewn Field~
   Old masonry litters the Ithilien Fields here, the remains of 
the once mighty Garrison. A recently constructed fort, built 
from much of the stone and fire-hardened logs, rises from the 
fields here, the raw growth jutting forth harshly from the scene 
of the battlefield. Thick weeds grow everywhere about the area.

Hastily Dug Passage Beneath the Ground~

hacked away from the underbelly of Arda here, the dark earth cut 
aside to form this space beneath the surface of the Ithilien. 
From the earthern ceiling tree roots hang, large hunks of rock 
dug about in the twining, twisting tunnel. The ground underfoot 
is uneven, sloping up and down but rarely running straight.

Under the Shadow of Shattered and Broken Stone Walls~
   The high stone walls of ruined Osgiliath, ragged and crumbled 
stonework, rise erratically upwards to the west here, and run 
from north to south, before curving back westwards towards the 
banks of the Anduin River. The land near the walls has become a 
treacherous bog, with small patches grass and dead trees 
scattered about. Some animals can be seen here though most flee 
when startled.

Healthy Countryside Southeast of a Ruined City~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a man's shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks.

Healthy Countryside Under Damaged Walls~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a man's shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks. To the north the damaged walls of a ruined city rise up, 
curving around from the north back to the west towards the banks 
of the River Anduin. Fresh stonework reveals attempts made to 
seal breaches and rebuild ramparts.

By the Anduin River, Under the Shadow of Ruined Walls~
   The mighty River Anduin flows past these riverbanks to the 
west, going from north to south. The land near the river is 
quite fertile, with grass growing and water birds making their 
homes among the reeds that grow near the water. The bank slopes 
gently from the west and the water's edge and rises slightly 
towards the east. Some animals can be seen here though most flee 
when startled. An abandoned section of city wall rises up to the 
north, coming all the way to the river's banks. It has been 
repaired sufficiently to block access, but where ramparts once 
might have stood, now there is rubble.

among the rocks as well as among the small green and brown shrubs 
that also grow in the area only reaching a man's knee in height. 
Some trees can also be seen among the hills though not many.

Northern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The pale waters of Morgulduin run in a generally east to 
westerly direction lapping against the rocky shore. The bank of 
the river is barren mostly and in places broken with dirt and 
rocks falling into the water. Shrubs and grasses grow but only 
barely and mostly remain far from the waters edge. The sounds of 
the wind, the occasional bird and the water are the only ones 
that intrude upon this place.

they are shy and avoid contact with any who are near. Trees 
shadow everything though none block the sky fully as the area is

Light Woodlands South of a Road~
   Some animals can be seen passing through this area, though 
they are shy and avoid contact with any who are near. Trees 
shadow everything though none block the sky fully as the area is 
only light woodland. The ground is littered with dead leaves 
that have decayed over time and the soil is mostly moist 
displaying small shrubs everywhere. The ground towards the west 
has been violently pushed skyward, creating a steep, stone 
escarpment that runs from the south to the north. Fallen trees 
lay, their mighty roots pointing skyward on either side of the 
stone escarpment.

North Ithilien Hills South of a Road~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks.

Northern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The bank of the river here slopes sharply into the water, 
which runs over rounded pebbles and rocks. Trees grow near the 
bank and sometimes roots stick out into the water. Grasses and 
shrubs grow here as well though mostly they seem to be dying and 
these are few and far between. The river is accessible though 
the slope is often slippery.

North Ithilien Dry Plains~
   The terrain is rocky, with very little vegetation and no sign 
of animal life. Boulders dot the landscape, and jagged, dark 
gray and black stones litter the ground, occasionally shifting in 
small, tumbling landslides. The mountains of Ephel Duath loom to 
the east, stark and black, with the ground rising sharply to meet 
them. 
To the north a road passing through the Morgul Vale can be seen.
While to the south there is the slippery banks of the Morgulduin.

Barren Hills of North Ithilien~
   Jagged gray and black rocks are everywhere; occasionally, 
loose sections of ground shift and tumble west, where the land 
slants downward. Looming to the east are huge mountains, looking 
just as desolate as the nearby terrain. There is no sign of 
plant or animal life. Scattered here and there are the cracked 
and desiccated remains of long-dead trees. 
   The flank of a mountain of the Ephel Duath rises up at a steep 
slope, hemming in the lands to the east.

On the Battlements of Arradoc~
   From up here, the dismal village of Arradoc is visible, 
clustered tight with refugees from the farmlands recently fled to 
the safety of the walls. To the west the untended fields lie, 
while a series of steps leads down to the path that leads through 
the buildings of the village. The wall is rather low, no more 
than six feet in height, with the pallisade logs coming to 
mid-chest above the wooden platform that runs behind them.

Setup Room for Arradoc Militia-men Defenders~
   Greetings! 

Please strip off of all your clothes, and then dispose of them 
using the junk command; you'll have opportunity to get outfitted 
in gear befitting a peasant militia soon enough. 

Remember that this will be an In-Game environemnt you are 
entering, and you are expected to act like a fearful peasant 
militia at all times. 

The basic backstory runs as such - since the Vanguard's loss of 
its northernmost fort to the forces of Morgul, the Vanguard has 
been unable to mount a rescue force to Arradoc due to the close 
proximity of Baakath-Morgul forces at their rear. Nor has the 
populace of Arradoc been available to evacuate past a heavily 
fortified enemy position. A few boats were in the town, but 
these were quickly appropriated by the more resourceful residents 
who have since fled. 

There is no one left to come, all the scant peasants in the 
Ithilien have crowded in, all able bodied and willing men and 
women to fight having had weapons pressed into their hands and 
ordered onto the front lines. Far from an experienced military 
force, the Arradoc militia is a last ditch force of peasants 
determined to hold off the evil hordes of Morgul that now quickly 
approach...

Rubbled Path West of a Gate~
   What was once the village of Arradoc is now is an active state 
of dismantlement, teams of orcs and goblins working at pulling 
down buildings and digging away at the ground, tearing up the 
very cobblestones. Bellows and shouts rise up from burly 
fore-orcs as the effort takes place, shaded here by the town wall 
that runs in from the east before twisting up to head north. The 
occasional fir tree, trunks stripped of bark, rises up high, 
providing some shade from the sun during daylight hours. To the 
west, a working gate lies, a squad of orcs manning the 
battlements above it.

Rubble Strewn Road~
   The dirt square of Arradoc is covered in hunks of rubble and 
pieces of burned wood, this area seemingly a dumping ground for 
the orcs that move to and fro carrying debris and working at 
excavating caves from the ground. Bordering this area to the 
west and north are a row of stout log cabins, splashed with dark 
paints that draw crude symbols, the most common one of a gaping 
eye socket. A narrow path leads off through a gap in two houses 
to the north-west.

Ruined Road Before a Barricaded Gate~
   What was once a road of polished river stones running from 
north to west has been torn up by one of the teams of goblins 
that moves through the area, working at excavating caverns 
beneath what was once the town of Arradoc to prepare it for 
Orkish inhabitance. To the south, a gate in the walls of the 
village stands, unusable due to rocks, logs, and all other manner 
of items dragged across it in a crude barricade. A set of 
stairs, however, runs up beside it to lead to the battlements.

By an Eastern Gate Covered in Rocks and Rubble~
   Logs, rocks, hunks of wood and anything else that was no doubt 
nearby and heavy has been piled up before the eastern gate, 
rendering it inoperable and thoroughly impenetrable. The stone 
wall about the village rises up from the debris, running from 
north to south, along top it dark-skinned men roam under the 
Crescent mark of the Silvermoon Dervish. All about the village 
of Arradoc goblins work, tearing up the road and digging in the 
ground. 
   To the north, a large building marked with a Crescent moon
rises up from the filth and mire of the streets.

Narrow Dirt Path~
   From the jagged ruins of the village to the south, this narrow 
dirt path runs off relatively free from the fires and 
construction efforts that ruined the log huts and stone buildings 
of Arradoc proper. Many of the log cabins that line either side 
of this trail have been taken up by new, orkish inhabitants, the 
windows boarded up and a thick layer of canvas stretched between 
many of the houses, shading the road.

Beaten Dirt Path~
   A beaten dirt path stretches in from the east, broadening as 
the trail gives way to a simple cabin and a collection of doeskin 
tents. Racks, poles, and counters are set about seemingly at 
random, hung and strewn with fish, meat, vegetables, and 
sometimes what seems to be little more than garbage. The market 
is by no means sanitary, and a questionable odor lingers in the 
area at all times.

log cabins of various sizes and ages. To the east is a market 
that smells strongly of all sorts of foul meats, while to the 
north is a ruined hull of a building, charred and blackened. 
Wild grasses grow along the sides of the path, with occasional 
clusters in the warm weather growing right up through the cracks 
in the dirt.

   A large brazier in the centre of the room, set close to the 
floor around a series of thick pillows, casts a warm light over 
the stone walls of this room. About the edges are a number of 
low set individual bunks, bearing the occasional resting 
dark-skinned soldier. The walls of the building are plain, save 
for the eastern one, which sports a narrow staircase rising up to 
the second floor of the building.

   One large table, easily big enough to accomodate a dozen or

corner of the room a small kitchen is assembled, a number of 
dark-skinned men bustling about it cooking at all times, other 
people of a similar hue doing odd tasks and chores of a martial 
manner about the room; sharpening blades, polishing armour, 
fletching arrows. A staircase leads down to a warmly lit room, 
and a solid oak door sits in the southern wall.

   This small clearing is tucked amidst thick undergrowth, 
flanked by the massive cliff that rises above to the east. The 
ground is cleared roughly, a few stumps and leafless saplings 
still present around the perimiter, bare stone and dirt present 
elsewhere. Almost no sky is visible through the canopy overhead, 
leaving the area shadowed even during the day. The camp is 
protected by a heavy growth of thorn bushes, the only entrance 
being a thin path that tapers toward a scraggly shrub that can be 
pushed aside.

A Low, Musky Burrow~
   There is little room in this warm, dark burrow, the earthen 
walls rising up overhead to form a low ceiling. Mottled with 
roots and stones, the soil from above has caved in here and there 
to let light filter through. The air is musky and the area lined 
with a thin coating of fur, the evidence of animal inhabitance. 
To the west the ground rises to a hole that leads outside, which 
is covered by shrubbery. The burrow continues to the north into 
darkness.

   Dug into the earth, the walls of this low chamber rise up in a 
snarl of roots and stones that gleam with moisture, while the 
floor has been worn fairly smooth by paws and a thin layer of 
shed fur. The air here is thick and warm, a musky scent mingling 
with the faint smell of urine. A couple shallow nests have been 
dug out, free from stones and debris. The area narrows as it 
continues to the south, and peripheral chambers have been 
scratched out to the north and east.

A Dirt Marshal Yard Within the Small, Timber Walled Fort~
   With dark dirt underfoot in this small, marshal yard within the timber 
fort, the area is enclosed by stout walls of sharpened, hardened logs that 
form a rough circle about a central tower. A northern door leads into the 
central log tower. Battlements are being constructed upon the timber walls. 
The yard is a bit cluttered with stacks of logs and rope scattered about it.

Inside the Charred, Wooden Tower~
   What is left of this squat, wooden tower is now charred and 
blackened, a few logs missing from the crude walls. Debris and 
dirt litter the interior of this room and the ceiling is open to 
the elements, destruction and charred bits of what used to be the 
battlements easily seen from above. There is a sturdy ladder 
that leads up through the open ceiling though a few steps are 
missing and the top half is burnt to a crisp, ready to break and 
fall through on an unwary step. 
   The door to the south half hangs upon its hinges, creaking 
loudly when closed or opened.

UNUSED The Vanguard's Kennels~
   This stone room is a low room which seems to serve the forces 
stationed in the city as a kennel. Several chains hang limp from 
the farthest wall, where large canines could be leashed properly, 
allowing them to wander over to piles of hay for rest, or to 
wooden tubs containing water or cut meats. The smell of fur, 
meat, and the barks of chained animals fill the kennel with a 
lively, active feel, the animals appearing to be well-cared for 
and fed. 
   A strong door allows one to leave the kennel by a short flight 
of stairs, leading to the gatehouse.

The Shattered Gatehouse of the Fort~
   This gatehouse has been marred by visible signs of battle. 
Scorch marks cover the northern wall, with rubble stacked and 
piled at it's base. A narrow path cuts through this rubble, and 
leads to a stone stairway that winds up into the wall itself. To 
the east, a rope-lashed portcullis fashioned from cut logs guards 
the exit out of the fort. A wide doorway leads westward into a 
dirt yard, while the southern wall is bare save for a rusted iron 
sconce.

The Dirt Yard Littered With Stone~
Dirt stretches from the base of each wall, a pale brown in 
color. Framing the yard are four walls of battered stone, a tower 
set into the south-western corner . A large doorway gives access 
into the squat tower, its battlements jagged against the 
skyline. The partly collapsed frame of a building resides to the 
north, its decline obviously caused by part of the wall 
collapsing atop of it. To the east a gatehouse is present, a 
wide doorway leading into it. In the middle of the yard is a 
stone-ringed fireplace, the stones themselves blackened from 
continuous exposure to flame and smoke.

'The Stone-Enclosed Collapsed Building'~
   The essence of foul smell here is pungent, constantly invading
any space. Amongst the stalls and bones, a varied collection of
fur and droppings have been layered over a few rough pits dug
into the northern side of the collapsed room. The original frame
for the building has been shifted forward by the sheer amount of
stone that partly encases it from the north end. The ceiling is
pitched towards the back, and several holes have formed in it,
allowing collections of rock to reside within the shelter.

The Landing of the Broken Tower~
   The room that resides in the base of the tower is circular, as 
is the tower, with a simple staircase winding itself upwards 
along the wall. About the room, racks and tables have been 
placed in strategic locations, bunks along one wall while a table 
sits firmly in the middle. The stairwell has been roughly 
repaired, untreated sections of a pale wood being used to 
reinforce aged and weathered planks. To the north, a square 
doorway leads out into a yard. Constantly alight, a sturdy 
fireplace made from cut stone is set into the eastern wall, it's 
chimney ascending high into the ceiling. The room has an earthy 
atmosphere to it, and smells strongly of leather, hides and old 
wood. The ceiling is composed of an apparent landing high up in 
the tower.

Inside the Broken Tower~
   The most prominent thing of the room, a large section of the
eastern wall is missing, with a few wooden boards laid across to
a section of the battlements outside. The wall that surrounds the
room only travels upward shortly, before coming to a stop and
giving a clear view of the sky. Bunks have been moved and tossed
about the room, some laying atop others. The stairwell that had
travelled upward has rotted away, as have the floorboards been
dusted with rot in several places, and show signs swelling.

Upon the Southern Battlements~
   Atop the southern battlements of the fort, to the south the
impressive view of the treetops of the Ithilien. The wall stands
atop the edge of a cliff, and below a large collections of stone
and rock have tumbled down to a resting place. The wall itself
runs behind the tower to the west partly, before being sheered
and the masonry now forming a dangerous slope down near the edge
of the cliff. A few boards have been laid across the small gap
between the battlements and the tower, giving one access into
the top of the now battered and broken structure. The battlements
form a corner, before hooking northward to a fortified location
over the gatehouse.

Atop the Fortified Gatehouse~
   From here, the remaining walls of the fort are visible. The
western and northern walls have become little more than mounds of
fragmented stone and masonry. Half of the southern wall remains,
the line out of sight behind a squat tower. The tower itself is
capped with a rugged and broken crown of stone, apparently broken
in half. The battlement here travels northward to the face of a
cliff, before turning back westward and sloping down to a row of
piled stones that now form the wall. To the west, a dirt yard is
present, and to the east a path travels down a sleep stope into
the Ithilien. A stone staircase recedes into the middle of the
wall, allowing someone to travel down into the gatehouse.

Before Ruined Gates~
   A wide, rectangular shaped plot of rubbled stone squats to the 
west, a battered, fire-gutted tower rising from the southern end. 
A newer looking gate and drawbridge are set before the ruins of 
this once-fort. A narrow strip of rocky land runs north and west 
before the fort, along the edge of the cliff it is built upon. A 
steep trail descends to the east, while far below the chasms 
shadowed bottom lies in view.

A Beaten Trail Up the Face of the Bluff~
   This trail climbs to the west, leading up the eastern face of 
a dark brown, rocky bluff. Its dirt surface is packed solid by 
the heavy, regular tromp of booted feet. Lining the path on 
either side are boulders and rocks of varying sizes, cleared out 
of the way and piled up. Eastward, the trail opens out onto 
lower lands, though the not-so-distant peaks of the Ephel Duath 
dwarf this cliff by many sizes.

Just Inside a Gaping, Jagged Hole~
   Jagged rocks extend from the sides of this hole descending
in to the earth. The rocks, many of them appearing incredibly 
sharp, jutting out like daggers, and some of them smooth and 
rounded. Above, the sky of Ithilien is easily visible, and with
some effort a person at the top could look around the immediate 
vicinity. Below, the maw extends downwards, any light from the 
surface fading not long into the journey.

A Dimly Lit Stable~
   Sitting as a hollowed out shell, these stables have since been 
turned into a kind of excavation. Were it not for the large 
sinkhole in its center, and the large mounds of earth strewn to 
either side, it could easily fit a dozen horses with room to 
spare. The walls and a ceiling are made from sturdy cedar and 
oak timbers, lashed together to create a sturdy frame for many 
overlapping planks of timber. Mud has been packed hard into 
every possible crack or crease that would let in light from 
outside, effectively making the stables a cave. The large 
sinkhole leads down into darkness.

The Crumbling Edge of a Huge, Deep Sink Hole~
The ground here has been violently sucked downwards, leaving a gaping hole with ragged, crumbling edges. There is no sign or remnents of once, or if any structure ever stood on this piece of ground, save for the ruined stone frame just to the east. A well-worn dirt path leads from the stone frame to the very edge, pieces of still falling into the gaping maw. Just inside there are traces that it was once filled with water, though looking down, none can be seen.

Deeper Within a Gaping, Ragged Sink Hole~
   The craggy surfaces all around begin to slowly spread wider, 
like the beginning of some giant shield. Boney finger-like roots 
poke through the rock and soil, and above the sky of Ithilien is 
difficult to see. Insects occasionally make their way along the 
walls and roots, burrowing and clambering over most surfaces. 
Below, the hole continues to widen out, the darkness below total. 
   
   A fairly wide ledge extends from a porion of the wall here and 
angles slightly downwards. The ledge itself, wide enough for a 
man to traverse.

small puddles of rancid water. Various pieces of debris, stone, 
timber, bones, and a variety of other items are piled towards the 
center of the chamber. A long, scaled, translucent skin lies on 
the floor along the walls, wrinkled and twisted. There appears 
to be a narrow gash in the wall towards the east.

   Between the looming peaks of a valley through the Ephel Duath 
- the Morgul Vale - thousands of crude tents spread out across 
the bleak, rolling plains. Fierce palisades skirt the encampment 
from one side of the valley to the other, securing the stretching 
encampment. The torn leather tents are lain in no particular 
grid but scattered haphazardly over the barren landscape which 
itself is a land strewn with grey and brown rocky soil, rendering

besides that, it is mostly quiet.

The circle of charred and blackened stakes continue to ring this 
area, leading southwards further around the camp.

A Dense Stand Of Forest. ~
   The forest is dense here. Young trees are mixed with bushes 
and high grass and roots, making travel slow and and sight short. 
The green walls surrounds you and the leafy canopy above filters 
most of the light and sounds seems to be absorbed by the 
vegetation. 
   A thin path trails through the forest, winding back and forth. 
Footprints and broken twigs hints of recent use.

A Small Camp ~
   Set in a dense stand of forest the grounds falls inwards 
towards a wide depression. Small trails appears from a number of 
directions and lead down towards the worn and trampled bottom of 
the depression where a small camp has been erected. Tents and 
lean-to's lay packed around campfires. 
   There is a faint smell of smoke and decay in the air, refuse 
lays scattered around the corners of the camp

Common Room~
   Opening up into a bedraggled common room, the staircase meets 
the floor with no railings or device to keep the unwary from just 
plummeting straight down. Refuse and trash litter the edges of 
the room, piled high in some corners. The smell is one of rot 
and decay and the walls themselves are full of blotchy stains and 
solidified food that sticks out like extra mortar.

Storage Room~
   This small room has come to serve a function to which it was 
not originally intended. Pools of dried blood, layers upon 
layers having dried one over the other, create a marbled tone to 
the floor. The walls are streaked with dried viscera and bursts 
of copper that radiate in every conceivable direction and angle. 
The room smells of iron, sweat, and blood.

A Low, Narrow Crawlspace that Curves to the South and West~
   A pungent odor seems to permeate the very stone of this 
crawlspace, adding an extra difficulty to any attempting passage. 
The already low ceiling drops, forcing any to crawl on all fours 
if they wish to continue. Rats and their ilk dart past on 
occasion, though most very cautiously. Reddish, grey-streaked 
stone seems to be predominant in this area.

tunnel leads northwards into darkness. The air is musty and 
dank, becoming warmer with each step. The sides of the tunnel 
are supported by wooden timbers that create a support lattice and 
keep the earth and stone from collapsing. Every so often the

   A wide-spread campsite, set by black-bloods and evil men, 
chaotic and foul-smelling with banners marking owners of the 
various tents. Made from all sorts of quality, material and form 
they are scattered wildly with the evil men distinctly separating 
themselves from the orcs and their kind. Fortifications exists, 
but in an unorganised manner and a few barrels have been stacked 
on high ground to allow for the semblance of an archery tower. 
Excrement's and rotten food are thrown on the ground and walked 
over, and the stink of black-bloods hang in the air to fight a 
never-ending battle with perfumes, incense and spices.

atecho  4549 As the howls and screams of the orcs rises through the gathering, the smell of blood from sacrifices given reach out to the black-bloods, something settle through the mass of orcs gathered. A wild fervor and a sense of being outside their bodies, a feeling of gathering and an quickening of the blood. Something primitive and evil stirs within the spirits of those inclined to evil and violence, regardless if its the presence of some supernatural entity or the  gathering itself there are an unmistakable common urge to go forth with blade and torch to cut, destroy and burn all that is bright and good. Weapons are waved, war cries raised and many eyes filled with blood lust glance about without a cause to set to slake the burning sensation in their blood. When chance is given, they are ready for war against the west.

Older and more scarred black-bloods starts speaking of plans, of heading out when darkness falls to bring ruin upon the men of the west. Many feel sluggish and tired from drinking and shouting - quite a few retreat to tents and resting places, where they can sleep and dream of bloodshed to come. A scarred Mongrel dressed in leather hung with wargs-teeths string his bow and slips away into the forest.

Shedding of his own black blood, and dripping it down on the dark metal while it is still so hot that steam rises when the drops meet the iron. You have caught the eye of someone, or something.

Inside a Ruptured Hold~
   This once-whole and well-made hold of a large cargo ship has 
been ruptured and shattered by some force unknown, it now laying 
on its side adjacent the bank. Water is perhaps thigh-deep 
throughout the cracked-open innards of the ship, a veritable mass 
of broken crates and ruined cargo floating in the water. 
Once-fine silks, now ruined, float through the water, as well as 
thoroughly-rusted metal. The curved bottom of the ship leads 
both east and west towards seemingly still-whole rooms.

   Jagged rocks cover the sides of this line running through the 
ground, the chasm barely the width of a Man. The rocks 
themselves seem incredibly sharp, some of them even connecting 
with the other side to form small arches and daggers of rock 
which jut out perilously. Above, the sky of Ithilien is easily 
visible, and with little effort somebody at the top could look 
around the immediate vicinity. Below, the chasm extends 
downwards, any light from the surface fading not long into the 
journey, though lit lanterns have been placed at intervals along 
the stone walls.

west slopes gradually down until it levels out, still fairly high

river continues down its middle. Rats, insects and other things 
of the dark tunnels scurry past. The walls are smoothed, with a 
faint reddish color when visible.

   The tunnel branches suddenly here, the stream continuing east 
along the smooth-walled passageway. To the north, the wall seems 
to have lost a sizeable portion of its surface, the rock beneath 
scarred and marred with spiky potrusions of stone. Slightly 
above ground level, a hole, once small enough to force a Man to 
crawl in, penetrates the sullen visage of the northern wall. The 
hole has been enlarged considerably, now large enough for a 
normal size man to walk through with just a slight bend of his 
neck.

passage. To the north, the ceiling of the passageway lowers some 
and any noise echoes faintly in the weighty air. A salty smell

The walls to the east are more jagged than the rest, and a small 
crevice has been carved within. The curve itself is a perfect 
curve, softly rounding out any corners to continue onwards. The 
ground sparkles against any light, and small shoots of grey mark 
the otherwise creamy, slightly reddish color of the ground.

walls as well begin to widen, enough to allow three men abreast. 
The stream continues, expanding as it goes, the rush of its 
waters echoing against the silence and the harmonic surface of 
the soft-stoned walls.

A Rough-Walled Tunnel~
   A faint, pungent odor drifts to the north, though as one moves 
south it fades. It is replaced, however, by the sound of rushing 
water, the river in the center of the tunnel expanding now so 
that only thin ledges allow access on either side. The ceiling 
rises high above, echoing any sounds made with the regularity of 
perfect acoustics. Streaks of grey now dominate the red-tinged 
walls, and the ground is uneven and silty.

Before a Yawning Chasm~
   The river suddenly streams into empty air as the tunnel seems 
to stop here, the thin ledges on either side giving way before 
the rushing, agitated waters flowing over the edge and into the 
darkness below. The definite roar of the waterfall is magnified, 
echoing throughout the high-ceiling, wide cavern to the south. A 
small box-like crevice has been chiseled into the side of either 
wall, the rough stone beneath showing streaks of silvery grey 
running all along the walls, ceiling and ledges. The drop to the 
south looks extremely perilous, with only the sound of water 
hitting water hinting at any kind of end to the pit.

A Cramped Corridor~
   A pungent odor seems to permeate the very stone of this narrow 
corridor, adding an extra difficulty to any attempting passage. 
The already low ceiling drops, forcing any to bend at the waist 
if they wish to continue. Rats and their ilk dart past on 
occasion, though none seem to come from the north. The reddish, 
grey-streaked stone seems to be predominant in this area.

A Turn in a Narrow Corridor~
   Turning slowly, the corridor opens up a little bit here, 
allowing more width. Various small skeletons, mostly of rats, 
begin to appear in various states of decay. The pungent odor 
continues to rise to the west, while receding to the south. No 
life seems to stir here, and all is filled with a heavy silence 
only occasionally broken by an echo.

A Narrow Corridor~
   Suddenly opening up, the ceiling rises sharply to allow one 
coming from the southern gap in the lower part of the wall to 
straighten up. Still narrow enough, however, to prevent passage 
of more than two abreast, this corridor is ornamented by the dull 
ivory of rotting bones. The ground below is silty, though a 
hard, grey-streaked stone ensures firm footing. A rank odor 
fills the area, seeming to come from the west.

A Cavernous Space~
   The walls quickly narrow to the south, forming a corridor at 
odds with the rest of this bulbous space. High-ceilinged, it 
encompasses quite a bit of room. The grey-flecked and streaked 
stone which makes up the walls, ceiling and roof reflects any 
light, casting a silvery halo over the ground and illuminating 
the area more than would be expected. Yellowed bones litter the 
ground, and a mixture of decay and filth fouls the air.

   Connecting the cavern to the east with this bulb-shaped room 
is a short corridor-like entrance, truly only two slightly 
extended walls and a high ceiling. The reddish stone below is 
firmly placed, its surface smoothly polished by ancient rushes of 
water. The center of this room is at a slight dip, leveling off 
near its center. To the west a tunnel branches outwards, as well 
as to the north and south.

A Rough-Walled Tunnel~
   This small opening in the wall leads further inwards, the 
darkness hiding the multitude of subterranean insects, spiderwebs 
and other less friendly things. The once-smooth walls seem to 
have been roughened by the passage of time or some other 
phenomenon and the heavy, dead air hangs as a reminder of the 
thousands upon thousands of pounds of rock precariously balanced 
overhead. A small box-shaped hole has been carved into the side 
of the wall, the ceiling shifting like a frozen wave as one goes 
further within.

A Descending Slope~
   The slope here has been suddenly halted by what appears to be 
a cave-in. The massive rocks are stacked at perilous angles, 
reaching the ceiling to firmly bar the way. A small, square hole 
seems to have been carved into the side of the passageway. 
Streaks of grey run through the fallen rocks, the walls and the 
ground, though on some of the rocks a glossy black color becomes 
apparent.

   The walls here reflect any light, giving an impression of a 
sparkling wall. Upon closer inspection, one notices that the 
rock is smooth and shiny, reflective. This continues further to 
the south, though the ceiling and ground are dark, brooding 
affairs of stone when compared to their more vertical 
counterparts. The floor is smooth, offering no obstacle or 
danger as one continues. To the north, the walls widen sharply.

   The walls of this tunnel jut out at random intervals and 
pointed angles like angry blades stabbing out to pierce 
intruders. the hostile gaze of the cracked and jagged ceiling 
above presents no better alternative from the mishapen ground. 
Small holes and variations in the ground promise the danger of 
falling to any who step unwarily. A few of these holes seem to 
lead further down, though they are only as large as a hand.

   A wall of stone and rock rises up to the west here, the pile 
stretching until it leaves only a small gap between its top and 
the ceiling. The ceiling itself continues, though it appears as 
if there is a hole in the rock ceiling above the pile. The 
ground below is scattered with old rocks, dust collecting on 
their surfaces. A gentle dripping noise can be heard from the 
west, and to the east the tunnel continues without hindrance.

A Sparkling-Walled Room~
   The walls smooth out here, rounding into a chamber of sorts, 
which appears bigger than the passageway. This is in part due to 
the ground, which slopes down into a kind of basin. It is also 
due in part to the sparkling of the walls, thousands of tiny 
mirror-like facets reflecting any light thrown their way. When 
lit, the entire cavern seems to shine brilliantly. The largest 
facets of this run along the walls like giant mirrors spread 
haphazardly. Even below, on the rocky ground, the surface holds 
touches of this smooth reflectiveness, almost making it appear as 
if one is walking on reflective glass.

Within a Small Tunnel~
   This small tunnel doesn't really seem to be a tunnel. It 
seems more like a shaft, running amidst jagged outcroppings of a 
clear, colorless crystal. These continue to the north, while to 
the east and west solid walls of a speckled grey color rise up. 
The southern tunnel seems to have been blocked by the cave-in 
which created the hole in the ground below. The air in this 
tunnel is warm, bordering on hot. The smell of rotten eggs wafts 
very faintly here.

   The tunnel stops abruptly here, passage to the east blocked by 
a large mound of stone and rubble. It does not reach the 
ceiling, however, a small gap visible atop this dangerously 
shifting pile of rock. A hole is directly above it, just big 
enough to accomodate one person. To the west the tunnel runs on, 
the stony features of the walls closing in a bit as the ceiling 
cramps forward as well.

A Shallowly Sloping Tunnel~
   The ground slowly begins to descend here, this change barely 
perceptible so small is the rate of change. Above, the dark 
ceiling looms like a massive weight, reminding any of the 
thousands of pounds stacked overhead. The air is dead and thick, 
and dust coats everything, giving a lackluster gleam to the 
faded, slightly reddish rock.

A Steepening Descent~
   The ground here begins to descend at a fairly steep angle, the 
shallower regions above long forgotten by the time one reaches 
the halfway point. The ceiling remains static, continuing in a 
near-horizontal line along the length of the tunnel. The walls 
contract, however, giving the impression of a veritable chute 
descending into the bowels of Ithilien's soil. The rock below 
becomes sturdier as one continues, firming and coated by dust.

In a Sudden Chasm~
   The walls suddenly drop here, the narrow pathway left 
continuing into an immense chasm. On either side of this narrow 
walkway is darkness, an inevitable doom waiting in the 
unfathomable depths below. The ceiling above is shadowed, yet 
the dead nature of the air here reminds of the weight of stone 
hanging perilously overhead. The sounds of dripping water echo 
throughout this space, and as the walkway continues to steepen 
down, it becomes difficult to continue.

Approaching a Near-Vertical Spot~
   The now-glossy, black rock of the walkway is at an incredibly 
steep incline here. It is difficult to find good footing, for 
anybody, on the glossy, smooth rock below and it does not become 
easier as one continues. Just a bit farther to the west, the 
walkway attains a point where it is nearly vertical in its 
descent. The smooth face of the walkway presents a strong danger 
to those not careful and skilled enough. Precarious handholds, 
enough only for fingers and toes, are the only visible way of 
continuing. On either side and forward, an empty darkness 
awaits.

Clinging to a Vertical Strip of Rock~
   Dead stillness is all around this strip of vertical, glossy 
rock. Darkness extends its way onwards, preventing any sort of 
true vision. It is not aided by the black, glossy material of 
the rock, and neither is climbing. Offering very few and 
precarious holds, it is obvious that a single misstep, a single 
miscalculation will send any climber plummeting to unknown depths

   The rock here widens, becoming more than just a small strip. 
It seems to expand towards the east, though it does so slowly. 
The glossy material, a deep black in color, reflects any light 
and provides slippery to no grip. Only very small potrusions or 
lesions in the rock allow the barest of handholds. To cling to 
this is very dangerous indeed. In all directions, darkness looms

   The glossy rock here prevents any kind of strong grip, forcing 
one to use the tiny and precarious potrusions and lesions within

On Vertical Black Rock~
The black rock here seems as if it were not finished, its top merging
into the strip of stone to the northwest. As it goes down, however,
the rock continues to expand outwards, thin tendrils connecting it
to the darkness. The sound of rushing water sounds, faint, from below
and one can smell a sulphurous odor here. Precarious handholds are
evident going down and west.

On the Surface of a Glossy Wall~
   The holds here begin to come more often, and in easier 
positions. They jut out occasionally, enough for an entire foot 
or a firm grip. The glossy black rock seems to become crusted 
with what appears to be a green, mossy substance. It clings to 
the rock, though it does not provide any kind of hold. The sound 
of rushing water below is fairly loud, and a small variaton is 
audible from the west, a duller roar. To the west, darkness 
still awaits while to the east the rock face continues. Above, 
one can only see darkness.

Upon a Shelf-like Potrusion~
   The stone here has become more fragmented, with potrusions 
such as this one providing solid, stable platforms of glossy 
black rock. The rock itself is much more craggy, with 
dangerously sharp edges. Directly below, a river can be seen 
rushing past, its cool, clear waters dark in the humid, cool air. 
To the east, what seems to be a small strip of sand lies some 
distance below.

Near the Wall~
   The rock here extends into small bridge-like formations, 
linking with the wall. The handholds are few and precariously 
made, with sharp edges finer than a swords'. Directly to the 
east, what appears to be a small hole in the impenetrable guard 
of the chasm wall peeks out timidly. It is only reachable by a 
very thin formation of rock that extends horizontally into the

Above a Strip of Sand~
   Small, stair-like potrusions in the rock lead down towards a 
pebbled strip of sand near the rushing river. A mist clings to 
the glossy rock, making it even more slippery than before. The 
occasional jutting edge forces anybody above a child's height to 
bend their way around them, and a faint roaring sound can be 
heard. To the east, a massive rock face shoots up, disappearing 
out of sight above.

Atop a Small Bridge-like Formation~
   This very thin strip of glossy black stone extends outwards 
into the air, providing little grip to any traveller. The air is 
the only handhold. The occasional bat wings its way through, 
skirting any life. To the west, a rock wall rises up out of 
sight and to the east the vertical face of black stone matches 
it. Aside from these bulky landmarks, simple air awaits. Below, 
jutting rocks gaze hungrily at any unfortunate enough to fall. 
On the eastern wall, a small cave is visible.

Within a Small Cave~
   Seemingly carved into the rock face here, this small cave 
extends more outwards than upwards. The occasional scratching 
comes from above, accompanied by the sound of dripping water. 
These drip from the dark into what appear to be holes in the 
ground. The liquid within them is clear, smelling faintly of 
sulphur, and steams lightly. A fine mist accompanies the warmth 
emanating from these holes.

A Strip of Pebbled Sand~
   Black pebbles cover the dark sand here, a bulwark against the 
rushing river which occasionally laps and overtakes pieces of the 
edge. A short length of the glossy rock protects this place from 
the currents of the water. To the east, the river continues into 
the darkness while the land ends abruptly. To the west, the 
strip continues into a small tunnel-like hole. To the north, 
jagged rocks shoot upwards like fangs, providing a challenging 
obstacle.

   The water here already tugs and pulls with the power of the 
current, the crisp, cold water icelike. The sand below gives 
easily, sinking and at some points simply dropping off. As one 
continues further, less and less stable surfaces allow movement, 
with the water rising to about neck-length on most about ten 
steps in. A few steps farther, the water is darker.

The ground is filled with sediment, small particles of dust and

small spiders. The smell of rotten eggs, mixed with a sweetness 
in the air, wafts through here.

fungal moss line the sides of the shaft, and a small square, 
box-like, has been carved into the rock. The smell of rotten 
eggs is prevalent, and the tastes almost sweet.

An Ascending Slope of Greyish Stone~
   A pungent odor reminiscent of rotten eggs wafts here, the air 
holding a sweet taste. The stone all about is a dark grey, and 
the shaft becomes shorter and shorter, eventually forcing one to 
continue at a crawl. The shaft continues, with more space, to 
the south whilst to the north it squirms its way upwards.

Below a Hard Rock Surface~
   Blocking the way up, hard greyish rock stares down the shaft 
with patient gloom. The smell here is harsh, a mixture of rotten 
eggs and something sweet. Only greyish, white-streaked stone is 
here, the shaft itself small and narrow enough to force one to 
crawl. The shaft continues at a slope, heading back down.

In an Underwater Tunnel~
   The water here is cool, yet warmer than above. This tunnel 
curves its way downwards into the crust of earth which encircles 
it, jagged edges and knife-like rocks jutting out to impede 
passage. The tunnel continues downwards and upwards, where 
roiling water awaits. The water here is fairly calm, though 
there is a certain current dragging one down.

The liquid is warmer, though, becoming rather hot. The current 
is less powerful, allowing easier access between the smooth pikes 
of black stone. It is difficult to see anything, the darkness of 
the water causing the darkness of the stone to meld into their

difficult. Dips promise twisted ankles and easy falls, while

seems to have taken a large tree with it, a part of its trunk 
rising from the fallen earth. The graben continues to the east

   Wide wooden planks are laid side by side over thick timber 
piers that extend above the flowing waters of the River Anduin. 
Fastened to these planks are heavy iron cleats, to which a number

rough rope lie about the pier as well. A thin path, lain with 
cobblestones leads from the thick wooden planks of the boat dock 
up the bank to the east. Several buildings constructed of 
squared logs stand to the northeast and to the southeast of the 
cobblestone pathway. The constant pressence of the forested 
Ithilien towering over them farther to the east. The sound of

Stout Timber Dock on the West Bank of the Great Anduin~
   Fastened to thick, seasoned timber pylons, freshly cut planks 
have been laid to form a dock on the rise of the west bank of the 
Great Anduin. The constant rumble of the mighty current of the 
river as it rushes southwards can be heard. The fields of the 
northern reaches of Anorien stretch out to the western horizon, 
where they meet the thick woods of the Druadan far to the south 
west. Behind the trees rise the White Mountains, upon whose 
southern flank the White City rises high above the lands below. 
To the east, an island with sheer stone cliffs rises from the 
depths of the river, its sharp northern edge forcing the waters 
of the Great River to part before it. A forbidding fortress 
clings to its sheer southern face. A wide wooden bridge spans 
the Anduin here and stretches towards the fortress. 
   A high wall surrounds this dock, with an iron gate set in the 
western gatehouse.

depths of the river, its sharp northern edge forcing 
the waters of the Great River to part before it. The 
cliffs rise high above the river at the northern point
of the island and fall gracefully towards the southern 
end. Though the island flattens somewhat at the southern 
end, it still rises above the river on sheer cliffs of 
stone. Tall trees cover the island as it slopes down 
from its northern peak, covering the flat areas as well 
as many clinging to the slopes, grasping precariously to 
the bare stone, their mighty roots penetrating any and 
all cracks and crevices. Many various sized balconies 
and towers extend from the cliff walls, some with 
entrances in to the very heart of the stone while others 
cling to the shear stone face, all connected by a 
network of covered stairways and ramps. Proud banners 
flap in the wind on poles on top of each tower, boldly 
announcing who dares own this fortress in the bosom of

Within a Steamy Cave~
   Stagalmites coated with warm moisture crawl their way out from 
the walls, the water dripping from them into murky puddles 
underfoot. Expansive and hollow, the caves sheer size causes the 
constant noise of trickling water that drips from tiny cracks in 
the ceiling to become louder in echo. Stringy brown mushrooms 
glow in clumps on the outcroppings of broken rock, at home within 
beds of moss while minute nuggets of vibrant colored, glossy 
stone glow softly with any light that hits the walls. Several 
bones lay littered over the wet ground, some large enough to 
suggest their origins being big game or other large beasts. 
Despite the presence of water, there is a somewhat foul reek 
about the area, the scent of decay.

on the surface and spilling over the floor where some overflow. 
To the back of the cave is a large, nest-like area comprised of 
broken branches, pieces of fur and flattened bones. Faeces cling

Edges of a Deserted Camp~
   Running around the outside of this camp is a palisade made of 
strong timber and heaped earth. The entrance is barricaded with 
spikes that jut up from the ground, save for a narrow spot in the 
center. Clearly able to support a sizable number, stacks of 
bones litter the ground along with a maze of old tracks. To the 
north a ruined tower dominates the area. Near the center of the 
camp a huge hole has been dug, passage to its depths is granted 
by several rickety ladders. Tent building materials lay in 
several piles around the camp, where they have been abandoned 
haphazardly.

In a Dark Small Warren Under The Camp~
   Devoid of any light, this wide warren is just large enough for 
the average man to stand upright in. Dug out from the compacted 
earth and barely strengthed with wooden joists, it is a recent 
addition to the camp above. The ground under foot is damp and 
pools of murky water collects in various places. To the east the 
warren expands out a great deal higher, though from it a terrible 
smell travels down. A small tunnel has been dug out to the west, 
where it opens up into a small cave.

Within a Wide Cave~
   Large than the warren before it, this cave is far wider and 
higher and hewn from the solid rock and stone. At the far end of 
the cave a large pile of rubble and stone has been set. The 
edges of the dwelling have been left jagged and sharp where 
patches of hard stone have been uncovered. The only light in the 
room comes from the large fit pit dug in to the ground. In 
various places there are stacks of gnawed bones.

In The Shadow Of A Ruined Tower~
   Extending out from the palisade a ramshackle leanto has been 
built, far from sturdy it blocks out the majority of the gaze of 
Anor. As with the rest of the camp, scattered bones have been 
left where they were tossed or fell. Under the cover, most of 
the earth is fire blanked and scorched. To the north a ruined 
tower stands partly restored with wood from the surrounding area.

A Deserted Corner of the Ruins~
   Scattered about the ground, in more places than the rest of 
the camp, are piles of bleached bones. Various cooking 
implements are scattered about the area, rusted and blunt. A 
well trod path leads to the east and to the rest of the camp. 
Protecting the area the wooden palisade runs around its edge, 
reinforced with packed earth around its base.

Inside a Ruined Tower~
   Once proud and strong, this tower has been reduced to a shadow 
of its former glory. The majority of the eastern side having 
been destroyed and left collapsed at its base, the cause of such 
still lying unmoved inside it. The other half stands defiant 
against the elements. Part of the stairs snake upwards in to the 
higher reaches though these end midway up, taking over is a wide 
ladder that runs to the ruined edge of the parapet.

Atop a Ruined Tower~
   From atop the ruined tower, one can see over all the 
surrounding areas without hinderance. Only half of the upper 
tower remains, the other half having collapsed in on itself and 
left lying in a heap at the foot of the tower. Around the edge 
that still stands a weathered set of battlements stands granting 
some protection and cover from western attacks. A wide ladder 
set on the ground allows access to the ground below.

Within a Dark Cave~
   This small cave has been recently dug out. Piles of dirt and 
broken stones shore up the crudely hacked out walls. In the 
center of the room, the ground has been dug out and piles of 
bones, rotten vegetation, and decaying bits of meat have been 
piled high. The rotten stench of death wafts up and out into the 
tunnels.

Upon A Sun-Baked Trail Amidst Barren Terrain~
   This trail is barren, and devoid of any vegetation as it runs 
east and west to the north of a set of desolte hills. This 
landscape is blown by strong winds frequently. To the east, the 
mighty Ephel Duath rise up, scraping at the sky as they blot out 
the sunlight that would otherwise fall upon this lifeless trail.

   Raucous and loud, this camp is bustling with denizens of 
Mordor. Watches and patrols of orcs and the occasional troll 
venture out. Archers get spelled on the outskirts of the camp 
while on the inside, fights and slave-beatings punctuate the 
normal activity among the orkin factions. Those who wish to

Within a Crudely Fortified Bridgehead~
   The boards forming the floor of the bridge are smoothed, fit 
together well, and are quite even, making walking upon them free 
of hazard, and also presenting a sharp contrast to the planks 
covering the bridgehead. The walls are crude, though certainly 
sturdy enough to keep out rain and arrow-fire, and the ceiling, 
though equal in that respect at least, is distinctly uneven, the 
wood roughly cut. To the north, a narrow doorway, wide enough 
for perhaps two men to fit through at once, though certainly not 
comfortably, sits in the wall, though, as yet, it lacks a door.

A Cramped, Smoke-Stained Backroom~
   Old smoke stains the dark-washed ceiling and walls of this 
cramped back room. Every flat surface is cluttered and covered 
with various utensils, implements, and scraps of faded parchment. 
The grungy floor is littered with things like wooden tubs, 
barrels, nets, and rickety crates. Dim lamps provide meagre 
light and plenty of shadow, with a rickety ladder leading up 
through a hole in the ceiling, and a scratched, sturdy wooden 
door leads back out into the common area of the lounge. In 
moments of great quiet, the faint sound of scratching and 
scurrying can be heard beneath the creak of the floorboards 
underfoot.
