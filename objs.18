A pile of disorderly trash is strewn about the area.~
   This pile has numerous small items that have washed down from 
the refuse dumps on the streets above. Some items may have been 
washed up here by high sewage levels as well. While much of this 
pile is filth, there are a few things that may still hold some 
use, although the malodorous stench will deter many scavangers.

intricate criss-cross of gold silk ribbon.

   A horrible stench rises from the water that flows from the 
mouth of the culvert. A few hands inside the tube is a sturdy 
iron grate, seemingly able to withstand the forces of nature that 
seek to rust it to pieces. Refuse is stuck to the bars of the 
grate, but the force of the wastewater pushes past it anyhow. If 
one were to get past the surge of sewage flying past, they would 
see that the grate has been affixed upon hinges, but only swings 
into the flow.

seek to rust it to pieces. Refuse is stuck to the bars of the 
grate, but the force of the wastewater pushes past it anyhow. If 
one were to get past the surge of sewage flying past, they would 
see that the grate has been affixed upon hinges, but only swings 
into the flow.

grappling-hook UNIQUE_RPROG 18103 iron rope rubble METAL~
a grappling hook stuck in the rubble~
A grappling hook is stuck in the rubble here, its rope leading down into the darkness of the sinkhole.~
   A hemp rope of roughly ten feet in length has been knotted 
through the hole in the grappling hook. Four large iron prongs 
form out, each hooked at the end so that it may gain purchase 
when required, from the centre of the hook. Of a fair weight, 
the grappling hook is ill-suited for use as a weapon save for the 
truely desperate, but instead made for the purpose of scaling and 
climbing.

a one-armed statue of a woman~
A pile of rubble and debris at her feet, a beautiful woman is depicted here in statue form.~
   The most noticable feature of this statue is its missing arm, 
broken off by time and weather over the years it has seen. 
Otherwise, this woman is wonderfully beautiful with a round face 
and full, pouting lips that are gently curved into a smile. The 
crumbling stone of which this statue is built does not dampen the 
beauty of her face, nor does it hide the true craftsmanship used 
in its making.

a defaced statue bearing a large sword~
The defaced statue of a man stands here proudly, bearing a large sword at his front.~
   Swathed in robes, the form of this man-sized statue is 
ambiguous at best as it has seen much ware. Most noticably 
lacking a face, bits and pieces of its robes and armor are broken 
away or missing all together. Atop its head is sculpted a jagged 
crown that is fused together with tiny pieces of glass to give 
the illusion of gemstones. In its hands, facing the ground, is a 
long bladed sword of rusted iron that is clearly older than any 
man. The grip on this sword is unmoving without the use of 
tools. At the statue's foot a small title is etched in 
Numenian-Tengwar: XXVII - Tarondor.

A weather-worn statue of a woman and child looms here.~
   Broken bits of stone lay scattered like debris around the base 
of this enormous, weather-worn statue. Spiderweb cracks wind 
their way over the shape of it, minute chunks missing in several 
areas where the damage is more severe. The statue itself shows a 
womanly figure, whose robes have carefully been carved to denote 
a flowing quality. Her delicately-carved hands are protective 
cupped over a small stone figure which tries to hide itself away 
against her. Some of the fingers of the woman are gnarled and 
twisted from the wear of the elements, the grey-granite from 
which they have been carved stained darker hues. Her face holds 
ambiguous features with a long, aquiline nose. Faint lines have 
been tenderly etched at the corners of her eyes. Little can be 
seen of the child who is sealed in the folds of the womans robe.

demolished remants statue Telemnar legs stone dark TILIAN STONE~
the demolished remnants of a statue~
Standing here with spread feet are a pair of dark stone legs, its torso lost.~
   About waist high on an average man, this pair legs are all 
that is left from a once proud statue. Perhaps once of a great 
king or noble warrior, the man depicted here is lost forever. 
All that is left now is two armored appendages tied together with 
the lower portion of a pelvis. The grevious, uneven wound it 
sustained has left a rough surface at its top, rigid and unlevel. 
The armor sculpted on to the figure is masterful in form, great 
care taken with each rivet and scale. The hard stone that makes 
up what's left of this statue stands firm through the ages, with 
little ware showing on even the slightest of edges. The upper 
half of the statue is nowhere to be found. At the statue's foot 
a small title is etched in Numenian-Tengwar: XXVI - Telemnar.

a ruined, black-basalt statue~
A ruined statue of black-basalt is here.~
   Once perhaps the growning glory of a sculptors work, this 
statue of a stallion is now reduced to one which suffers from the 
maladictions of time. Carved from black basalt and reinforced 
with gritty mortar, the dark stone has lost its gleam with the 
cover of moss and the smear of grime that pollutes its surface. 
A equine face lovingly carved has half of its head shattered, 
destroying the fine features it may once have had. Bird 
excrement paints it with colours paler or browner in several 
areas, littered like a blanket over the muscled currents of its 
stone form. A flowing mane curves like errant waves around its 
neck, but is severely chipped and nicked.

A decrepit statue of a gnarled tree twists skywards here.~
   Sculpted from yellow-veined limestone, this tremendous statue 
towers several feet into the air. Each branch has been 
individually fashioned, twisting and winding and colliding with 
each other in sinious, snake-like length and from afar may seem 
like one coiled, sinister mass. The roots of the tree crawl over 
the square, solidlimestone block which acts as its base, nearly 
obscuring some faded etchings which have been reduced to vague, 
dulled imprints. Moss grows in thick patches over the statue and 
upon its base, tiny insects are often seen scurrying about within 
it.

A pair of ruined obsidian pillars stand here.~
   These toppled obsidian pillars are all that is left of what 
might once have been a grand archway. Now the remnants lay 
flanked by rubble and refuse which are caught within the nets of 
wilted ivy vines. Even though its found in abundance, the ivy 
struggles to grow. As if touched by some disease which squeezes 
the life from it, the brownish leaves are rumpled and wrinkled, 
while others are left dead upon their stalks. The midnight-black 
pillars which they veil are rutted and pitted, one standing 
taller than the other. A closer look at them may reveal minute, 
wave-like engravings, most of which are too filled with much to 
show further detail.

several old, mottled statues~
Several old statues are perched over the rooftops.~
   Perched high on the rooftops in a vigilant watch over the 
street are several old statues of eagles. Though crafted from 
the palest of limestone, the surface is corroded and scatched. 
Mottled patches of yellow and green have been burnt into them 
from prolonged exposure to the seasons. Perhaps the most 
prominent aspect of the statues are the detail which have gone 
into the creation of each one. Distinctly lifelike, some have 
wings aloft with taloned claws splayed, while others are hunkered 
forward and stare intently down to the streets; as if watching 
for prey. All have sharp, avian features, with the limestone of 
their beaks smoothened to tapering points and feathers 
individually carved.

the White Tree of Gondor, beneath which those capable of 
reading can see the words:

whatever front their wars were fought. Our world is less 
without you but your example will not be forgotten.

a small bronze flute with etchings~
A small bronze flute with etchings over it lies here.~
   This small, hollow tube of bronze has been polished to a high 
sheen. Four small holes form a line along one side of the 
instrument, designed to change the pitch when the flute is 
played. Numerous etchings cover its thin metal, most depicting 
small swirls and random patterns. In the centre of the 
instrument, the word 'Peraloth' is inscribed neatly in 
Numenian-Tenguar sigils, edged on either side by simple lines.

   This little infant spends most of their time sleeping, his 
expression content, even peaceful. When awake, little eyes of a 
rich brown gaze at the world, tiny little fingers opening and 
closing and at times, reaching out to grasp whatever might be 
within reach of his little hands, including fingers, hair and 
jewelry. A midnight crown of dark hair adorns his head already, 
fine as downy feathers and just as soft.

bright facets on the left breast is an intricate engraving of a 
hawk, wings outstretched in flight. Echoing this etching is that 
of a dove on the backplate.

painting vividly detailed ink painting UNIQUE_XPTaymeeka xElanor OTHER~
a vividly detailed, ink painting~
A vividly detailed ink painting lies here on the ground.~
   This particular wall display is done on a broad, coarsely 
woven linen canvas with a sturdy wooden frame. The image that is 
displayed is done in vivid detail and depicts the inside of a 
tavern. Within the colored ink 'painting' are many people, most 
set into groups of threes and fours, one group gathering off near 
one table appear to be animatedly speaking to one another, some 
from other groups appear to be looking towards this lively bunch 
as they talk about something. Off in another section is a group 
of what appear to be musicians in mid song, beating or strumming 
against their makeshift instruments. On the right side of the 
image is a long cedar bar with a fat, hairy-armed man standing 
behind it with a cleaning cloth in one hand and a shot glass in 
the other, looking to be cleaning the glass out as he stands 
watching the entirety of the room. Many of the people are 
wearing smiles or laughing, a few others who look to have chosen 
to sit by themselves merely appear content to watch the goings on 
of the tavern, sipping drinks or eating steamy meals set out 
before them. Barely caught within the art display is the image 
of a booth along the far left side of the canvas, a tall man with 
black hair and blue eyes standing with his arms crossed near it 
as if guarding the booth. Within the booth itself is a short, 
bright-eyed, sandy-haired man, looking to be caught up in 
conversation with someone, a faint smile curving at his lips, 
though who he is speaking to cannot be seen from the viewpoint of 
the art piece itself.

A short sleeved rosy pink dress with lily white accents has been left here.~
   This dress is made from fine quality linen and stitched by a 
master hand. The style is simple, but elegant, with a squared 
neckline and a flared skirt sewn very long, allowing several 
inches of dual-layered fabric to touch the floor. A rosy-pink 
bodice is fitted over the rest of the waistless design, extending 
up over the shoulders, secured with black laces across the bust, 
and left open-fronted for the rest of the length. The 
under-layer is lily-white, including sleeves which are gathered 
softly near the upper arm, making a ruffle effect before they 
cut-off just below the elbow.
