   This hastily made, hideous blade looks to have one purpose - 
the separating of one from one's limbs.  It has quite a bit of 
heft and would require above average strength to be wielded 
properly.  Hammer marks are visible along the blade, blackened 
slightly by the crude nature of the ore.  The hilt is made of 
frayed rope wrapped around the base of the blade, making it a 
challenge to grip in battle.

leather. There are minor perfections in the grain, but it will
suffice nicely for its dual purpose, which is to hold up one's
pants, as well as to attach a sheath to. The steel buckle
gleams dimly in the light, as the metal appears to be poorly
forged.

weight and probably a ider's. His tusks, short yet, are a 
beautiful white color. His snout is long and flexible, and he 
waves it about with dexterous ability.

This pair of thin, brown-framed glasses are terribly strong.  
When worn on the face, they help a short-sighted person see, but 
should someone with normal sight wear them, they give a terrible 
headache.  Other than the magic of lenses, however, they are not 
magical, and are in fact rather old, and the frame is slightly 
bent.

a delicate, $finecolor silk gown~
A delicate gown of $finecolor silk has been set here.~
   Made of a silky, very soft material, this empire-waist dress 
flows elegantly downward, draping along the ground just barely. 
A squared neckline trimmed in intricately woven, fine lace of a 
somewhat darker shade than the $finecolor dress scoops below the 
collarbone when worn. Below the breast, the material of the gown 
gathers tightly, bunched together at the seam to allow much cloth 
to flow gracefully. Just off the shoulder, the light sleeves 
drape downward, widening more past the elbow and toward the 
wrists. Though fairly simple in design, the delicate material 
allows for a very elegant appearance and pure presence.

flames.

A ring lies here, a red garnet set into the silver.~
This silver ring shines slightly in most lights, giving the 
impression that it is still somewhat new. On closer inspection, 
however, this impression is defined as incorrect, as there are 
several small scratches over the ring's surface. The gemstone, a 
red garnet, is smoothly polished and fits neatly into the ring in 
such a manner as to ensure it does not fall out, even when picked 
at. The piece is not kept polished, but seems to be of some 
sentimental value, as well as some actual value.

a brass ornament with three monkeys~
A brass ornament consisting of three monkeys has been discarded here.~
   Professionally cast from high-quality brass, this ornament 
consists of three monkeys standing on top of a small platform. 
The first monkey has his eyes covered beneath his large hands. 
The second and third have done similarly with their ears and 
mouth respectively. The engravings on the monkeys are very 
detailed, each finger and claw portrayed distinctly from the 
others, and the artist having had taken the time to engrave a 
texture to represent the fur of each monkey. The second and 
third monkeys have tiny faceted light blue gems inserted for 
their eyes that the knowledgeable person would recognize as lapiz 
lazuli. There is a small engraving upon the platform in Westron, 
reading, 'No see, no hear, no say.'

A stringed necklace made of eyeballs stares up at the area around it.~
   This string is threaded with numerous glass balls and claws. 
The string is no more then a thin leather chord through which, 
the objects are looped. Upon closer inspection the glass balls 
contain odd sorts of eyeballs from many different foreign 
creatures. Many are different sizes and shapes but all are 
suspended in some degree of water. When the wearer of this 
necklace moves, the eyes seem to roll on an unpleasant axis 
spinning around to different angles.

from a single branch of maple. It is well-polished, and a grip 
of supple leather has been wrapped around the middle. A thin 
string of catgut loops once around each tip, pulling the bow into 
an arc. The bow, though tapered at each end, widens toward the 
middle, but is slim enough to allow a hand to fit fully around 
it.

   This heavy weapon's head bears a darkened, tar colour, 
probably due to the chemicals used during its making. It appears 
a formidable weapon, one likely to cause great pain and anguish 
with its iron head and the momentum put behind it when swung. 
While not of the greatest quality, this axe still holds a sharp 
enough edge and is of sturdy construct to see it through the 
harshness of battle. Engraved into one side of its iron head is 
a symbol of a lidless eye.

A pair of pink silken baggy pants have been discarded into a pile here.~
   Composed of the softest silk, these pants are fashioned to fit 
snuggly around the waist, while at the same time, being loose and 
baggy everywhere else. They lack any evidence of having been 
sown together, appearing to be composed of a single piece of 
fabric that was somehow formulated in this particular shape. 
Their pinkish color is soft and pleasant to look at.

A bright pink top attached to a small burgundy jacket is here in a pile.~
   The top is a light pink color, cut in the manner so as to 
serve in the fashion of a very skimpy blouse. It holds the swell 
of a woman's bosom nicely, adding a bit more roundness to it as 
well. The material is a light fabric with minimal decoration, 
save for a few tassels hanging in the middle. Along with the top 
is a complimenting jacket that comes to the middle of the torso. 
It has short sleeves and is a burgundy color with a shiny pink 
trim.

   This small oaken table is a finely crafted piece of furniture. 
Intricate scrollwork, mixed in with delicate carvings of mythical 
beasts and man-shaped hunters adorn its four legs, while around 
its edge run a faint border of carved thorny vines. The center 
is plain, but the lack of ornamentation only serves to enhance 
the natural grain of the wood with a rich sheen. Four chairs of 
similar design sit around the table, their backs and legs showing 
the same carvings as the table.

a stately, smoke-grey marble desk~
A stately, smoke-grey marble desk faces the far end of the Hall.~
   Elegantly fashioned of the deepest smoke-grey marble, this 
massive, polished desk is formal and quite somber-looking. Its 
surface has been painstakingly etched with a variety of 
constructs, from distinctly alien-looking sigils and runes to 
eerily well-depicted scenes from the history of Middle-earth. An 
equally ornate chair has been set behind it, the headboard 
engraved in truesilver with a simple 'T'. Comfortable yet 
equally elegant chairs are arrayed in a semi-circle before the 
desk, for the repose of guests.

A crystalline sphere is here, mounted on a truesilver stand near the desk.~
   This large crystalline sphere glitters brilliantly with
numerous motes of internal radiance, almost as if it contained
the very stars of the firmament. Mounted on an ornately-crafted
stand of gleaming truesilver, it has been placed near the desk,
as if whomever resides here spends a great deal of time and
attention observing its myriad displays.

a heavy, maplewood crossbow~
A crossbow made of maplewood has been discarded here.~
   This crossbow is quite a complicated piece of machinery. A 
maple wood stock forms the base of the bow, upon it stretching 
out the winding and firing mechanism to propel ammunition with 
great force. A section of the wood extends outwards and is able 
to be propped on the shoulder, adding extra stability to the 
crossbow. A large iron ring on the end of the bow can be used to 
attach it to belts.

Lying on its side here is a small rowboat, a large breach in its hull.~
   Originally built for rowing ashore or for fishing from, this 
wooden rowboat is quite past its days now. The two rowlocks for 
the oars have rusted severely, any movement of them causing a 
loud creaking. A large hole is present in the hull, a rock or 
reef the most likely cause for creating the jagged gap in the 
wooden planks of the underside of the boat. Totally 
un-seaworthy, the rowboat is still sturdy enough to sit upon.

taste, they do not have so much as a smell to them, rather 
absorbing smells around them. Half a dozen leaves have been 
gathered here, fitting into the palm of a man.

   Cut from the hide of cattle, this is a belt of average grade 
leather. There are minor perfections in the grain, but it will 
suffice nicely for its dual purpose, which is to hold up one's 
pants, as well as to attach a sheath to. The steel buckle gleams 
dimly in the light, as the metal appears to be poorly forged. 
The leather of the belt has been dyed $color.

$finecolor dye has been evenly applied to the whole of the shirt, 
a further testamant to the quality of this garment. The sleeves 
flare out slightly as they descend down to the cuffs, and a row 
of polished bronze buttons trails down the length of the front of 
the shirt. A ruffled collar made from thin linen of the same 
colour as the shirt sits atop of the neck of this fine piece of 
clothing.

a radiant silver tree~
A radiant silver tree grows here, gleaming with argent light.~
   Before you stands Telperion, the elder of the Two Trees of
Valinor, oft called the 'White Tree'. His leaves are of dark
green, shining silver beneath, and his boughs are decked with
brilliant flowers that shed a rain of silver dew.

   Telperion endured throughout the Years of the Trees, but
came to an end in the dreadful event known as the Darkening
of Valinor. Even through the elder tree did not survive, he
was not the last of the White Trees. Yavanna had made an
image of him in Tirion, called Galathilion, from which the
White Trees of Numenor and later of Minas Tirith descended.

   More importantly, one of Telperion's flowers survived the
Darkening, and was set aloft by the Valar to become the Moon.

   Before you stands Laurelin, the Golden Tree of Valinor,
resplendent in her molten beauty. Leaves of a deep pearl-
green are veined with glittering gold, and she casts a
warm golden glow over all that behold her.

   Although Laurelin was destroyed with her brother during
the Darkening, one of her blooms did indeed survive to be
placed by the Valar as the Sun. Unlike Telperion, however,
the Golden Tree has no known descendents in Arda.

An iron mace capped with a smooth head lies here.~
   A dark, rough wooden shaft undecorated by gripping leather
is topped by a heavy, smooth and pitted iron ball. This weapon
appears to be crafted haphazardly, its maker trusting to the
simplicity of the design to inflict damage upon an opponent
rather than the skill of his work. Though crude in concept,
this device appears to be quite deadly.

striking surfaces with heavy canvas and some sort of stuffing.

climb all the way up to a circular rim, strong, single pieces of 
iron to hold the frame and the mesh together. Altogether a poor,

A long-bladed dagger lies here, the wooden hilt curved.~
   The fairly long, polished iron blade of this dagger joins 
elegantly with a simple, shaped crossguard of hammered bronze, 
creating an interesting contrast of metallic tones. The handle 
is fashioned of well-carved wood; simple, curved, and ringed with 
leather grippings to offer a snug, firm hold.

greatsword glowing sfUNIQUE sword finely crafted METAL~
a glowing finely-crafted greatsword~
A glowing greatsword of fine craftsmanship has been placed here.~
   Obviously designed for use with two hands, this sword measures 
perhaps five feet in total. The sturdy, cross-guarded wooden 
hilt is large enough for a comfortable grip with both hands to be 
granted, and the gleaming blade runs straight, forming a 
sharpened point at the end. When hefted with both hands, a fine 
balance that could only be the result of meticulous adjustments 
can be felt. The greatsword is emanating an intense bright white 
light.

A jewel-topped golden staff lies here, glittering brightly.~
   This long staff is made from some golden, metallic material. 
It is as light as a feather and gives off a bright glow. The 
surface of the metal shaft is super smooth, and is topped by a 
star-shaped cluster of luminous amethyst gems. When the staff is 
moved through the air, it leaves behind a trail of dazzling 
golden stardust in its wake.

A tattered heap of golden silk lies crumpled on the ground.~
   This tunic may have once been fine, but is now reduced to 
tattered shreds. It falls loosely to the wearer's knees in 
fluttery silken folds, glowing a soft golden sheen even in 
complete darkness. The garment is sleeveless, held up by two 
thin, fraying straps over the shoulders. Despite its appearance, 
the material, while petal-soft to the touch, seems strangely 
resiliant.

butterfly-like shape well. Some sort of gossamer-soft material 
has been stretched over a silver wire frame. The individual 
threads glisten iridescently, giving them an almost ethereal 
look; the generous amount of glitter spread over them sparkles 
magically.

A pile of crimson linen has been discarded on the ground.~
   Made of a crimson linen woven so finely as to feel almost 
silky, this dramatic gown sweeps to the floor in breezy, figure 
caressing folds. The waistline is simple, gathered slightly at 
the hips to add a gentle flounce to the skirt. The neckline is 
modestly high, scooping shallowly across the wearer's collarbones 
to thin straps over the shoulders. The back, however, plunges 
dangerously far downward, held together by an intricate 
criss-cross of silvery silk ribbon.

onyx, this coat's heavy leather enshrouds the wearer, collar
flipped up to obscure the lower portion of the face. The
leather itself is authentic Italian stonework, and the
coat itself is heavy, let alone the thick inner lining.
The coat's back is embroidered with the letters 'MIR.'

of glassy, dead brown eyes. Nestled below his eyes is a black 
nose with a set of whiskers sprouting out the sides. Protruding 
beneath his nose is a pair of large, sharp looking teeth. His 
sleek, unmoving body is covered in a soft looking hazel coloured 
fur. A strong looking, dark-brown leathery tail trails behind 
him. His four small, fur covered paws clutch a thick log, the 
latter of which apparently serves as a base for the stuffed 
trophy.

and they have deep red rubies for eyes. The seat and back are 
covered in large, thick cushions, and the throne is, therefore, 
very comfortable.

   This floppy-brimmed hat has obviously seen much wear and tear. 
Scorch marks, tears, and stains mar its dull yellowish fabric, 
which is rough and sturdy to the touch. The top of the hat forms 
a somewhat drooping inverted cone; the very tip has fallen over, 
which only adds to its disheveled, beat-up appearance. Despite 
this, the brim somehow manages to completely shade the wearer's 
face from view, no matter how bright his or her surroundings may 
be. The only thing visible is a pair of round, eerily-gleaming 
golden eyes.

from the hilt, and is thick throughout to add weight. The handle 
is made of wood, wrapped in black leather and offers a good 
counterweight to the blade. Even though poorply made, the handle 
is easy to grip, and the blade still can cause great damage if 
used correctly.

A small throwing axe lies here, its blade gleaming.~
   This small, hand-held axe looks very much like it could be a 
hand axe, yet it's approximately half the size. It has a thick, 
wooden handle, and a broad sharp curved head. The head is 
significantly heavy, but the handle of the axe acts as a good 
counter weight, making this axe a great throwing weapon. Quite 
short in length, there is only room enough for one hand. The 
sharpness of the blade, as well as the shape of the head, marks 
it as a flesh cutting weapon and not a wood axe.

a stuffed moose with immense antlers~
A glassy-eyed trophy moose stands in a corner, utterly still.~
   This moose stands so still that it can be quickly deduced that 
the poor thing is quite and utterly dead, and indeed, further 
examination reveals it to be stuffed. Its antlers spread out for 
an impressive width and height, and its bulk suggests it was no 
easy prey to take down. It stands on a wooden trophy board, one 
hoof raised slightly as if about to take a step forward.

A plush dragon sits here, its hues a myriad of colors.~
This small, velveteen-soft dragon is rather cute in appearance,
and, with the power of some sort of enchantment spell, simply
makes you -want- to squeeze, poke, or hug it. The colors on its
surface are a veritable riot, ranging from the darkest blacks to
the palest whites and every shade in between. A small paper tag
stuck to its chest says 'Hi! My name is... Eyania.'

Stitched into the underside, in red threads, are the letters MIR.

   Desinged to be used in the smoking of pipe weed, this pipe is 
of extremely old design and make, with the body extending out 
nearly half a foot and the bowl rather small. It has been built 
from the bones of a whale, scrimshaw, and meticulous effort has 
been undertaken to carve tiny pictures of dolphins and other sea 
creatures along its surface. The faint remnants of blue and 
black inks rubbed into the bone can be seen in the carvings, time 
having worn away at the strength of the colour. The pipe is lit, 
and the bowl is lightly smoldering.

in the hand for its comparative size, thanks to the material from 
which it has been built. Painstaking skill has gone into 
fashioning the elegant shape of the pipe as its length curves 
upwards at a slight angle, and tiny wisps of smoke have been 
engraved along its surface. The pipe has been lit, and it's bowl 
is lightly smoldering.

A marionette of a pixie, its wings tattered, lies here.~
   This marionette depicts a small pixie, the wings sprouting 
from its shoulderblades multicolored and tattered with age and 
wear. Whether this is by design or because the marionette is old 
is difficult to determine. The pixie itself is completely 
hairless, its skull is perfectly round, and its features are 
almost avian in their sharpness. It has overlarge coal black 
eyes, and is made of plush velvet. From the hands, wings, and 
head stretch strings, connected to crossed paddles for 
manipulation.

into a lanky depiction of a female wolf, the color of the stone 
shifts from a light grey over most of the body to a darker shade 
of deep cobalt blue at certain angles on the back. It sits back 
its haunches, head lowered a bit, with brown-hued eyes taking in 
the world in a frozen gaze.

a small charcoal sketch~
Dark charcoal lines cover a piece of parchment, which hangs on a wall.~
   This drawing is composed of simple, bold charcoal lines, 
shaded gently here and there with dark smudges and 
cross-hatching. It depicts a fire-side scene in the midst of a 
wooded clearing, tall pines dark against the grey horizon. 
Surrounding the fire are several human figures, and a lump of 
some sort of meat roasts on a spit nearby. All of the figures 
are garbed in simple, practical clothing, cloaked and booted. 
One small, dark-haired woman plays a flute, seated on a log 
beside a broad-shouldered and youthful looking man, who is in the 
act of polishing a long sword laid across his knees. One slender 
and fair-haired woman sits in the lap of a brawny, dark-haired 
man, his features strikingly similar to those of the flute 
player. The four all wear content expressions, and the entire 
scene is imbued with a sense of peaceful companionship. 
   A stylized bird is marked in the bottom right corner.

reside at the corners of the sockets, indicating her age. The 
long, uncolored stone hair of the statue has bangs falling into 
her face. Radiant shards of marble have been placed in the

allowing it to be used to sweep away dust and the like.

This gun is long and slender, its shape mostly resembling a
slightly flattened cone, its surface a shiny, smooth chrome.
It has a comfortable handgrip and trigger on its underside, and
a laser scope is mounted on top of it. It has a second grip
further up the barrel and an extendable bracket to butt up
against the shoulder of the one wielding it. Painted on the
side is the symbol of a jagged lightning bolt, above which is
the cartridge into which its ammunition is loaded for firing.

an unframed charcoal drawing~
An intricate charcoal drawing is tacked up on a wall.~
   Drawn with obvious care and painstaking detail on a thick 
piece of parchment is a darkly shaded scene composed with 
charcoal and ink. A pale-skinned female form stands amidst the 
bleak expanse of a walled-in graveyard, her downcast gaze hiding 
her eyes, but not the despondant expression evident on her 
sharply angular features. She is mostly in profile, tousled 
black hair drifting down about her cheekbones and ending at her 
jawline. Her small frame is rendered almost shapeless by the 
voluminous woolen cloak she wears, the hood pushed down about her 
thin shoulders. Her booted feet are mostly hidden beneath the 
hem of a long skirt, and her hands are folded behind her back. 
She stands near a small, moss-covered gravestone, one of many 
that file away in orderly rows throughout the tended flowers and 
trees growing nearby. Rain patters down from a cloudy sky above, 
and droplets of water hang from the leafy vines that form a 
twisting border around the edges of the picture. 
   A stylized bird is marked in the bottom right corner.

a curved, silver-finished French horn~
Curved silver pipes in the form of a French horn lie here.~
   This instrument has obviously been made by the hand of an 
expert. The entire piece consists of a mass of shiny, 
silver-finished pipes which curve in different directions. The 
pipes take on an overall rounded shape, with a straight leadpipe 
extending from one end and ending in a cupped mouthpiece, and a 
large, curved bell on the other end of the horn. Three valves 
are visible on which the fingers restm and also a curved piece of 
metal for the thumb and pinky to rest on, creating a comfortable 
grip. Overall is can be seen that the pipes are all 
interconnected, and pressing down the valves will redirect the 
airstream if one blows through the horn.

black steel legs extend from the bottom, creating a firm base of 
support. The top is adorned with a wide, flat black steel sheet. 
The sheet has several grooves and ridges stamped into it, and it 
looks like it could hold quite a few sheets of paper.

An etched, steel-bladed longknife lies here.~
   This longknife has been forged from fine steel and hardwood. 
Its blade long and slender has been made from tempered steel 
which has been well-polished and sharpened to be almost like a 
razor and which ends in a pointed tip. The long handle has been 
carved from some sort of hardwood which has been wrapped in black 
leather cord to offer a better grip as well as some additional 
weight for balance. Carefully etched into the blade is a picture 
of a wolf posed as if it were about to pounce upon some prey.

large red scar which runs down the left cheek from the temple, 
past the eyes, and terminating at the curve of the jaw. Hung 
here, this individual was undoubtedly a criminal of some sort.

polishes Falco's shoes, so that the real frost princess has time 
to do other things, like answering email, reviewing applications, 
running around catering to petitions, fixing things on an endless 
to-do list, and general slaving and whatnot. Not to mention 
being generally motherly over the rest of the staff to make sure

a pair of black sunglasses~
A pair of wicked-cool-looking sunglasses are here.~
   These glasses are constructed of sturdy, black metal and bear 
deep, black lenses. The lenses, rectangular in shape, are 
polished to a flawless sheen and reflect the outside world with 
intense clarity. The frame fits tightly around the nose and 
ears, as the lenses hide any expression which might be read from 
the wearer's eyes, save for that indicated by the eyebrows.

a black, flat-finished Desert Eagle .50 cal handgun~
a large, black, flat-finished handgun lies here, 'Desert Eagle .50' engraved along the slide.~
   This is a rather large gun, no doubt about it, the bullets 
that this thing fires must be huge. It is black, with a black, 
opaque flat finish. The hand grip is set with black rubber, to 
facilitate a steady grip on the weapon during discharge. The 
back of the grip is tapered to fit around the hand and the slide 
is notched at the back for ease in grip when pulling back the 
slide. Two sights are mounted at the rear of the slide and above 
the barrel. A large port is situated along the right side of the 
slide for ejecting spent cartridges. 'Desert Eagle .50' is 
engraved along the left side of the barrel.

This is rather large lead slug, separated from its shell casing
by what one might guess to be a rapid chemical reaction which
took place within the closed confines of a gun barrel.  How this
slug got here, or whether or not it found its target is anyone's
guess...

wood carefully bracing its gargantuan bulk. The boards of the 
ship are hewn from sturdy oak and fitted together tightly, with 
any cracks tightly sealed with rope and tar. Ten round ports are 
seen on each side of the ship, with a long, wooden oar extending 
from each one. A tall, sturdy mast rises from the center of the 
ship, with a large, red and white striped sail attached to the 
rigging.

a gleaming, silver-gold winged helm~
A silver-gold winged helm lies here, gleaming.~
   The helm gleams a metallic silver-gold in colour, its smooth, 
burnished surface reflecting back images in the light. It covers 
most of the face, guards extending down the sides to protect the 
cheeks as well as the head, and a long noseguard extends down the 
front, leaving only the chin unprotected. Small eye-slits allow 
the wearer to view their surroundings, providing little access 
for a weapon point. Two metallic wings sweep out at angles from 
the back of the helm, spreading from the head of the wearer. 
These have been etched to form the feathers, the minute details 
intricate and realistic.

A pair of spiffy denim carpenter pants lie here, crumpled in a heap.~
As these pants look rather new and are not faded, apparently
the owner is not entirely up on style; perhaps they just don't
care. However, these pants bear a number of fresh spills and
stains on them, ranging from mustard to grass-stains. A loop
of denim on the outside of the left thigh allow a hammer to
be hung there, though it is uncertain as to whether someone
would use it for such a thing in this age.

a Timex Expedition wristwatch~
A Timex Expedition wristwatch rests here, inserted from the future.~
   With a face roughly the size of a large copper coin, this 
wristwatch appears to be a couple years old, though still 
functions entirely properly. A thick, stainless steel back 
protects the innards, while a thin glass sliver allows one to 
view the time in both analog and digital format. A pair of brown 
leather straps extend from the face, one of which bears a clip 
and allows this timepiece to be worn around the wrist. A piece 
of leather seems to have been broken off, as one of the straps 
hangs freely outward. A button on the side allows the Indiglo to 
be turned on, and whilst they both keep the time accurately, the 
wearer appears to be too lazy to set the analog properly, 
although the digital appears to be correct to the second.

sheer amount of wear-and-tear obviously exerted on them, that
they were purchased many a year ago. They are a pair of white
Nikes, size fourteen and a half men's, and the right has a hole 
worn in its left side, exposing the wearer's big toe to whatever 
elements may threaten to breach the leather.

   Overall thin but sturdy, this iron-and-silver-alloy necklace 
is rather cheaply constructed, though it is rather strong. From 
this dangles a small pendant, the size of a grown man's 
thumbnail. This pendant depicts a skull wearing a helmet, rather 
grotesque in nature, with a sword plunged through both the 
cracked helm and cracked skull itself. In the skull's eye 
sockets are set a pair of clear crystals, and though at first 
glance they resemble diamonds, upon further inspection they seem 
more like quartz to the trained eye.

of the PHASER actually incorperates a smaller PHASER of the type 
1 variety, which locks into the top of the type 2 PHASER. The 
PHASER has an adjustment for power mounted on the back, with 
settings ranging from 'stun' to 'vaporize'. The energy is emited 
from the front of the PHASER through a pre-chamber and an 
apperture, this is truly a formidable weapon.

tails. The eye of each steed is set with a different stone, the 
first with a sapphire, the second an emerald, the third an opal, 
and the last a ruby.

   Bound in what was once fine leather, the cover of this large 
book has seen wear over the years, possibly even centuries. 
Traces of gold leaf can still be found on the spine, but time has 
long since made whatever title may have been on the book 
illegible. A pair of brass hinges are set into the cover of the 
book and can be used to latch it shut. Once shiny and bright, 
the hinges are now heavily-scratched and dull, but still 
functional.

   Both of these beautiful specimens have been stuffed, and set 
in an offensive pose. The lynx is rearing upward, forepaws and 
claws bared, teeth flashing as it glares down at the boar 
fiercly. The boar's polished tusks are upturned, pointed at the 
lynx defensively. Its legs are bent and its hooves are firmly 
planted, its tail lowered. Its coat, as well as that of the 
lynx, is well brushed and glowing. The eyes of the animals are 
set with shiny glass spheres, colored a rich burgundy. The two 
animals are fixed atop a richly stained wooden base, and look 
incredibly lifelike, seemingly prepared to burst into motion at 
any moment.

appears to be a barrel jutting forth. The weapon has a pistol 
type grip, the second hand meant to grip the weapon forward like 
a rifle. An odd cartridge snaps into place on the underside of 
the weapon, and sitting on the top is a long optic scope.

A set of razor-bladed claws lays on the ground here.~
Forged of sturdy, tempered iron, these iron claws are designed 
to be held by a narrow leather-wrapped handle, with the 
sharpened, glistening points protruding between the fingers. The 
bladed points of this weapon have been painstakingly sharpened
with attentive care. In addition the razor edges seem to come to a
barbed point at the end, suggesting a severe tearing action when
withdrawn from an opponent. These look to be increadibly deadly
in the hands of a skilled fighter.

A stuffed Geico gecko doll sits here, offering you cheap car insurance.~
   This creature is about the size of a wild cat, perhaps a 
tiger, but its skin is slimy and slick looking. It has a long 
and lizardlike body and walks on four feet consisting of little 
red frog-like toes. It is a forest-green in color with a 
bright-green streak running down its side, and has bright yellow 
eyes, slanted and lizardlike. Its tail is large and not terribly 
long, and its head is pointed, a large red mouth separating it in 
half at the front. Occasionally visible is a long sticky pink 
tongue, reaching outside of the mouth and darting back in. It 
looks exactly like a Tusken doll would.

A long stark white haori has been left here, a large black symbol on the back of it.~
   This seemingly airy haori is actually made out of a material 
that is quite thick. The soft fabric and intricate weave pattern 
of it makes it seem as to be near weightless and is extremely 
pliable. The haori itself is fit perfectly to the wearer. Along 
the bottom there are several long, but thin black diamonds woven 
onto it, which are set approximately a foot apart and a foot long 
all the way around the bottom. A single large symbol has been 
stitched into the middle-back in a bold jet-black. Underneath 
the long, billowing haori is a form-fitting midnight-black 
hadajuban which is over top of a pure white susoyoke. Although 
mostly covered by the haori, the hadajuban covers the chest, 
stomach, and is sometimes partially visible on the wearer's 
shoulders whilst in quick motion, however is mainly visible on 
the wearer's chest. Only the outline of the white susoyoke is 
visible at the neck just overtop the hadajuban.

   This long, billowing haori has been made slightly over-sized 
and more weighty at the top to help keep it draped over the 
wearer's shoulders. Unlike a normal haori, this one was not made 
to be worn normally, but instead draped over the wearer's 
shoulders. Although tailored to be longer, wider, and heavier at 
the top it is still nearly weightless. The main color of the 
haori is pink, darker pinkish-red flowers adorn the entirety of 
its back, and it is trimmed in a bright white.

stitching that runs all over the dirty surface. The murky indigo 
dye is coated in places with dried crusty liquids and slathers of

from a long, deep hood sewn into the back, the grime covered 
fabric moves freely as if the cloth was well worn in over a long

gruesome array of bone and skin have discolored the surface as 
dirt and other unsavory articles have taken their toll on the

a giant yellow marshmallow Peep~
A giant yellow marshmallow Peep lurks here.~
   Roughly shaped like a newly hatched baby chick, this humongous 
candy is made of white marshmallow with a slightly crunchy yellow 
sugar coating. Two tiny eyes have been coloured in just above 
its pointed beak. When eaten it tastes entirely like sugar and 
nothing else. This Peep has been aged to perfection, not too 
fresh and not too stale.

either end of the longbow. The weapon is fashioned of redwood - 
its surface polished and lightly reflective, but a dark red-hue.

a finely-made, jeweled dragon statuette~
A finely-made, jeweled fiery dragon statuette has been set here, glinting.~
   Grasping a crystal sphere in sharp claws, a dragon jealously 
guards his treasure. The sinuous reptile appears lashing his 
spikey tail as he breathes a fiery warning. Carved from obsidian 
glass, this dragon was created with painstaking detail. 
Thousands of tiny opalescent scales line its stomach, chest, and 
the lower part of his jaw. Its eyes are fashioned from two 
sparkling red rubies, and from its gaping maw a series of 
stretched strands of fiery red glass mimic an engulfing flame.

An opulent ruby imbued with a golden, glimmering spider lies here~
   This large jewel, faceted and of obviously masterful 
craftsmanship, is clear and casts any light refracted through it 
a bloody crimson. It is, perhaps, roughly the size of a large 
man's closed fist and comes to point on each end in the cliched 
diamond-shaped pattern. The most intriguing aspect of this large 
gem, however, is the form of the abnormally large golden spider 
captured within it. The creature's legs are splayed, four 
reaching towards the top of the gem, four reaching towards the 
bottom. The creature has been captured in exquisite detail, 
splayed as if in some collector's show.

A faceted sapphire pendant suspended on a fine mithril chain is here.~
   A brilliant, sizeable sapphire hangs suspended within a 
rune-etched mithril ring, its surface faceted and inlaid subtly 
with a single silver 'T'. The chain bearing the mithril ring 
seems fashioned of mithril as well, its links incredibly fine and 
well-tapered. A small, barely-visible silver clasp can be noted 
on one side of the sapphirine orb, and miniscule hinges on the 
opposing; it would appear to open, exposing an apparently tiny 
compartment within when doing so.

a ginger-cropped, scar-lipped man hand puppet~
A ginger-cropped, scar-lipped man hand puppet lies here.~
   This cloth hand puppet's short, oily, ginger hair is loosely 
curled and thinning in the corners. Typically mussed, it is 
occasionally finger-combed into a semblance of order. His 
aquiline nose and mobile brows give him a conspicuous profile, 
which is enhanced by the neat, thin scar of a recently-healed 
rivet through both of his full lips at the left corner of his 
mouth. Though merely insinuated when slack, his musculature 
shows clearly when taut, and a lanky grace propels the movements 
of his lean frame. He seems to be just reaching the middle of 
adulthood, but crow's feet, a dusting of ginger stubble across 
his jaw, and the poorly-postured hunch of his narrow shoulders 
give him a somewhat haggard appearance.

build. Faint beginnings of smile lines frame her ample, red-hued 
lips. Brown eyes peer out from under thin brows. Her auburn 
hair, lightly flecked with grey at the temples, is worn loose and 
flows down over her narrow shoulders. A few scars mar her 
visible skin and face. Her frame is a mixture of well-rounded 
curves and smooth, soft limbs.

   Made of black spotted, amber toned leopard skin, this sweeping 
cloak has been sewn both practically and beautifully. The fur is 
soft and sleek, and its thickness doesn't make the garment 
overbearingly warm. Its deep hood is lined with a thin brown 
linen and a small bronze clasp shaped like the paw of a great cat 
closes the cloak in the front. It hangs down to the wearer's 
calves and its light weight makes the cloak swish with every 
movement.

The Action Figure(c) of an ebony-haired, gossamer young woman has been left here.~
   This is the one and only Brylle Action Figure(c) with patented 
Sneak-Thief Action(c). She has hair of the purest ebony, which 
compliments the fair and well-tanned skin of her face. Her eyes 
are of a deep, brown tint and are constantly studying her 
surroundings so that she seems constantly aware of all that goes 
on around her. She is lithe in her build and graceful in her 
movements, though she tends to avoid any pronounced body language 
as she interacts with those around her. She obviously takes 
pride in her appearance, as her hair is pulled back from her face 
in a neat ponytail and her skin is noticeably free of blemishes 
or markings of any sort. She often smiles but not necessarily in 
a friendly way.

a long-haired, sharp-featured young man Action Figure(c)~
The Action Figure(c) of a long-haired, sharp-featured young man has been left here.~
   This TybCo Action Figure(c) immortalizes Tyberius' very first 
PC, Anafaroth, who sadly was recruited into the Eastern Garrison 
only to quickly become food for the wolves. Though he was 
short-lived, he was loved by his creator and he is still missed. 
This rough-skinned young man is of an above-average height and 
possessing of a burly phisique. Two eyes of a piercingly grey 
hue seem to soften the roughness of his face. His 
shoulder-length hair, of a golden hue, shows the wear of one who 
has travelled much. A three-pronged scar dominates the right 
side of his face, beginning at the top of his forehead and 
terminating at the keen line of his mouth.

An armored suit of plasteel stands here, for the time empty.~
   This several metre tall battle suit stands as a terrifying 
weapon of war by itself - matte black and unshiny, it bristles 
with rocketry and guns and only vaguely still resembles a 
man-like shape. Its helmet, fused to the rest of the piece, is 
the only part of the armor that glows: a dim yellow that lights 
up the face of the user within the suit. Scoring, scratches and 
other gouges wreck much of the black laquer of the suit, beneath 
it the armor suit is a sickly green colour.

tapering up slightly to the wearer's waist, these are of a fairly 
traditional style.

   This is a long musket with a high quality oak stock, 
reinforced with iron. The barrel extends a foot beyond the end 
of the base, well-crafted and round, straight as the naked eye 
can tell. It has a simple, circular sight on each end, 
calibrated to an inch at several hundred yards. The trigger is 
simple yet comfortable, and large enough for even the most 
collossal wielder to fire with ease. It has a large, silver 
coated hammer in the shape of a dragon.

Braided exquisitely, the pattern and texture brings nothing to mind so

ripples and eddies. The cording wraps a short distance up the wearer's
ankle, staying in place seemingly without support.

   The slaves here, while looking physically well-nourished and 
relatively fit, are clothed only in tatters, when they're even 
cold at all. The somewhat chill air in this pit-esque area would 
be hard on their flesh, and many bear gooseflesh from it, as well 
as superficial wounds--bruises, small cuts and contusions. It is 
rare, but present, to see one tortured into uselessness, 
whimpering in a crumpled, bloodied heap on the floor. Their eyes 
are leaden and dull, offering no spark of hunger for freedom or, 
really, anything but despair.

This long sturdy staff is made of some of the finest ash you have
ever seen. Wielding the staff you notice it is finely balanced and
can easily be used one-handed. The staff although sturdy enough
to turn the strongest of blows is not heavy enough to cause
much damage when wielded in anger. The staff is plain in design
but is highly decorated with silver runes engraved across its entire
length. When you wield this weapon you feel energy flowing from your
body into the staff as if it shares your very life essence. You
feel as if the staff is merely an extension of your own body.

trout frozen medium-sized weapon JAPHETH_ARENA MEAT~
a medium-sized frozen trout~
A medium-sized trout would be travelling upriver to spawn, were it not dead and completely frozen...and nowhere near a river.~
   This trout has seen better days, being that it is by now quite 
a while dead, and completely frozen solid. In addition, it's 
also being used as a bludgeoning weapon in a bizarre arena 
battle. Not quite what its mother intended when it waved it off 
to trout school that one fateful morning...

A silver chain lies here, bearing a smooth, brown river-stone.~
   This is a simple, smooth brown river-stone. The edges have 
been dulled and rounded by exposure to a river's flow, leaving a 
pleasing, if lopsided shape. It is attached to a very fine 
silver chain, the links of which are nearly indistinguishable 
even up close.

a volume that can be heard throughout the Plaza, and beyond.

a ram's-head mask~
A ram's head mask sits here.~
   Fashioned from strong, thick leather, this mask extends around
the head like a helmet and has been covered with sheepskin. On either
side of the head, two impressively large curling ram horns have been
sturdily attached.  They appear to add much weight to the mask, but
perfectly complete the likeness of a fierce, rugged ram.

A waterbed clothed in warm, yellow bedsheets is here.~
   This waterbed is made of a sturdy, wooden frame supporting a 
thick vinyl matress filled with water. A little seaworld lives 
within the matress, kept alive and sustained with magic. One can 
see miniature mermaids swimming about with a myriad of fish and 
one mermaid in particular looks oddly familiar, with long, red 
hair. She is accompanied by a little blue and yellow fish as 
well as a little red lobster. However, the little seaworld can 
rarely be seen as the bed is clothed with thick, warm bedsheets, 
an inviting yellow in color.

A plastic figurine of a bra-less feminist burning her books is here.~
   This little figurine stands at about a foot in height, molded 
of plastic. It displays a young Asian woman with brown eyes 
standing before a large bonfire that towers over her, smoke 
rising from a pile of burning books. She stands half-crouched 
before the bright orange and red flames, a book clenched in one 
hand, ready to be feed the fire while the other arm is raised in 
a pumping motion up in the air, fist clenched triumphantly. She 
is wearing a pair of jeans and a white, tee-shirt, obviously 
bra-less underneath. There is a little, red button on the base 
of the figurine, and when pushed, the woman shouts, 'Viva la 
Revolucion!'

longer for personal style of the wearer allowing it to be wrapped 
around the waist twice and then tied into a large bow leaving a 
long strand from both sides to drift in the wind, atleast two 
foot in length each. Other than it's unusual length, this obi is 
simply very well crafted and very unassuming.

with each facial expression. It is fashioned in the likeness of 
a grinning skull, with dark, hollow eyes and mouth, though no 
features of the wearer can be seen through it. Only a true 
Master of the Sith Order would wear this."

own way. It features five kamon from the left breast and moving

an enormous, glowing black mithril battlesword encased with lightning~
  This sword is absolutely massive. It's blade is a dark black
color that reflects light constantly as active bolts of white
lightning wrap around it. Loud crackles and sparks shoot from
the sword as it is held. When striking something, a loud boom of
thunder eminates from the sword. When Segomo's temper goes sour,
the lightning of the sword reacts violently, shooting off in 
random directions and becoming highly active and volatile. This
is the legendary sword AvenClash.

   This once-fine dress is in obvious tatters. Strips of the 
material would hang loosely about the wearer's thighs and around 
their arms, from the remnants of the skirt and sleeves. The 
shoulder-straps are in almost as bad of condition, appearing 
ready to break at any moment. The material itself, regardless of 
its color of origin, has been worn and dirtied the point of it 
being a permanent, stained brown. The only color of high-light 
are the even darker streaks of filth atop the cloth. Cob-webs 
and even small spiders cover the dress.

A large throne, inset with multicolor gems and made of a polished, white marble hovers here~
  This large throne is made of a pure white, polished marble. Its
shine is so bright that it amplifies light in the room, making the
only person who sits in it seem to glow. The base is set with a row
of many colored gems, arranged in a pattern to form a lightning bolt
that spans across the bottom and twirls it's way slowly up the marble.
The seated area is set with a fine, dark red cushion for comfort to
the chairs inhabitant. Emblazoned above the head of the chair beside
a royal looking crest is the name 'Segomo' spelled entirely out of
diamonds. The top of the chair is a pair of marble crossed swords and
the base of the chair is a large marble shield.  The oddest attribute
of this throne is that it does not sit on the ground, but rather it
hovers about an inch above the beautiful marble floor.

A scintillating pendant of moonstone and darkness lays here, glimmering faintly.~
   This pendant is made up of incredibly high quality moonstones, 
their once pure white surface changed into the deepest, 
night-shaded black. Rather than refracting light or seeming to 
shine in their own right, these moonstones have the opposite 
effect--They seem to suck the illumination from the room, making 
it a harsher, darker place. At the end of each cyllindrical bead 
a small nimbus of ghostly blue light forms, lending the 
illumination that comes from this pendant a rather otherworldly 
cast. Hanging central from the beads and onto the breast of the 
wearer is a large moonstone, its entire surface carved and 
enruned, each rune seeming to glint a fierce blue for a solitary 
moment, never lingering, but always present.

large horns protrude, their sharp tips curling down alongside its 
face. A fiery red light-bulb glows from behind plastic clear 
eyes, flaring up and down as the flames rise and fall.

an ingeniously-crafted, dragon-mannered flint and tinder kit~
An ingeniously-crafted, dragon-mannered flint and tinder kit lays here, glimmering in the light.~
   This brightly-painted, wood item is obviously the work of some 
master-level craftsmen. The wood of it has been adeptly carved 
to resemble a crouched dragon, wings pressed tight to its back, 
its snake-like head coiled as if preparing to strike. Small, 
individual scales have been carved into the wood and each painted 
a subtly different color, giving it a shining, glimmering manner. 
The use of such an item, aside from its beauty, is that the 
dragon's two front feet each click backwards, the sound of it 
audible. As it does so, the teeth of the maw strike 
together--dual pieces of flint, and sparks erupt out of its maw. 
Despite its flashy appearance, it is a very solid, dependable 
tool.

hat UNIQUE_PRAETH UNIQUE UNIQUE UNIQUE DO_NOT_LOAD_EVER thoroughly disreputable LEATHER~
a thoroughly disreputable hat~
A thoroughly disreputable hat is discarded here.~
   The hat is wide-brimmed and peaked like a witch's hat, made
of light-tan leather that has gone sueded with time. There is 
nothing about this hat that even vaguely seems reputable. It doesn't
sit on the head: it slouches there and glowers at people. It has a
malevolent presence all its own, a nearly-sentient aura of power.
An incongruous midnight-blue velvet hatband goes around its base,
and an even more incongruous balled fringe rings its brim's edge.
It is a shriek of defiance to all that is holy about the millinery
art; it is a bellow of contempt to fashion, style, and good reason.
However, in addition to all of these finer points, it's also 
extremely comfortable and sheds water wonderfully. The outlandish
fringe shades the sun a little more on bright days.

the words surrounding a depiction of a wooden barrel and two 
bees. The bottom inch of the can is painted in solid black, save 
two red dots on opposite sides of the can, within which is the 
picture of a glass of beer and the words "Smooth and Creamy."

   Thick and well-crafted, this tough leather has been shaped 
through boiling to fit over a horses midsection. Straps on the 
bottom of the barding allow it to be fastened onto a mount, and 
numerous steel studs has been struck into the leather to add 
extra protection to the set. To add some ornamentation to this 
armor, leaping stags have been embossed on several sections of 
it, particularly across the leather that will go across the 
horse's chest, forcing the Stag emblem into prominence.

   This steel breastplate has been expertly crafted, and polished 
to a high sheen. The steel is thick and heavy, and straps onto 
the body with dark, leather straps and silver buckles. The edges 
are turned, providing a nice rounded trimwork around the 
breastplate. It provides excellent protection for the torso, 
shoulders, and back. Along the front of the breastplate, a black 
hawk has been engraved into the surface, its wings spread and its 
head lifted in a fierce expression. The hawk has been rendered 
with demanding clarity, leaving the effect of the black hawk on 
the shining steel rather impressive.

A dual-bladed, matte black axe lays here.~
   This axe is akin to the bastard sword in that it could be 
wielded in either a two-handed or single-handed grip, making it 
compatible with a shield while still heavy enough to cast deadly 
blows against its target. Each side of this axe is gifted with a 
deadly-sharp blade, the steel of it a matte black. With the 
careful balance between weight, the dual blades, and the quality 
of the steel, this weapon is obviously of master level. Along 
the haft of it, the White Tree has been rendered in its 
traditional colors against the black haft and, atop its trunk, 
amongst a plethora of smaller letters, a large, ornate 'B' has 
been placed.

an odd, metal cage marked with an iron blood droplet~
An odd, metal cage marked with an iron blood droplet lays here.~
This odd metal cage is roughly the size of a large book, and looks as if its function is to store that very thing. It is a cage-like apparatus, with hinges to allow it to open and close, alterantively caging and then releasing a large, specifically-sized tome from within it. The iron of the item is old and scarred, pitted with age and apparently heavy use. When the cage is closed around a book, several finger-length iron bars slide into the grip of their counterparts on the lower side and, when the lock is turned, secured there. Conversely, whenever the lock is turned and opened, it does so with the audible protest of iron scraping on iron. Along the front of the book, where the cover would be, in crude iron scrollwork, there is simply a large blood droplet depicted in the pitted iron.

This key is composed of heavy iron, beginning to rust and scarred from apparently frequent misuse. It is unordinarily long, a full hand-length on the average man, and is of plain design until one reaches the slightly rounded end. Pressed upon the ancient iron is the look of a single, scarred blood droplet.

An ancient tome marked with a scarred droplet of blood lays here.~
This large tome seems to speak of a time long past, before finery, before civilized behavior, and before sophistication. The leather is simple and rough, worn soft only with the passing of time. Its cover is scratched and unadorned by any lettering or sigils, the only ornamentation upon it is the mark of a single, large blood droplet drawn on the front of the cover. The blood droplet seems to have been scarred with intentional force, gashes and deep marks transgressing the original image. Around all four corners of the book's cover and back, heavy indentations are present, as if some heavy object had weighed on those sections.

   This bronze star seems to have been created of relatively 
common-place material. It is composed of a circular piece of 
bronze and, atop its surface, a bronze star, slightly misshapen, 
raised upwards. A series of elaborate cracks run over it and, at 
first glance, they seem to be little more than that. It isn't 
until one takes a very close look at this ordinary bronze star to 
realize that they aren't cracks at all, but intricate markings.

From each end of the scroll, marking the top and bottom of it, twin, psuedo-arrowheads protrude, shaped into cruel, black spikes. The scroll itself is sealed with a foreign, black substance, now dried as hard as stone, bonded between the bits of parchment.

Holes and tears smear this tattered sackcloth canvas with a tale of violence and woe.  Its left arm is nearly missing, leaving little more than long slashed strips.  The right is stained stiff with a coppery colored substance long dried, while other parts are singed and peeling back as if repulsed by the flesh beneath.  The robe is long and thick, baring a cowl that seems to be in better repair than the rest of the garment.  Sickly white maggots cling to the deeper folds about the hem awaiting their next meal.

   Perfectly spherical and a little over two feet in 
circumference, pieces of leather have been stitched together in 
an alternating patter of black and white hexagons to form this 
football. It is bouncy and well inflated, looking just right for 
a game of football. Of course, this ball is intended for use in 
the real game of football, and is nothing like the squashed egg 
shape that is used by moronic Americans in that game they like to 
call football even though ninety percent of the time the ball is 
carried in hands.

from the letters BWFC in a mixture of blue and red, with a ribbon 
of each colour streaming from the base of the letters.

   A number of finger-length leaves blossom out from the core of 
this plant, making the entirety of it perhaps as large as a grown

is not overly bright but, when observed in darkness, would 
illuminate some three or four inches away from the farthest 
extension of its leaves. Any who were to touch the leaves 
themselves would find them soft and pliable to the touch, while 
still holding a mysterious cold, even in the warmest weather.

xxtrog_gland slick egg shaped gland mottled grey OTHER~
a slick, egg-shaped gland of a mottled grey~
A slick, egg-shaped gland of a mottled grey lays here.~
   Roughly the size of a man's eye, this small gland is slickened 
and pliable to the touch, pressure offered to it forming a dent 
in the sensitive bladder's exterior. When moved, a small 
sloshing sound could be heard within, as if this egg-shaped item 
were filled with some sort of liquid. This small gland's outside 
coloration is that of a dark, mottled grey, and its slick surface 
gleans faintly in the light.

Theracite ore utterly clear roughly cut piece OTHER~
an utterly clear, roughly cut piece of ore~
An utterly clear, roughly cut piece of ore lays here, the floor visible through it.~
   This roughly hewn piece of ore is roughly as wide and thick as 
a grown man's wrist, making closing one's fingers about it a 
difficult affair. The ore itself is as clear as glass, offering 
no distortion to any who would look through it and see objects on 
the other side. Light that is refracted through this piece of 
ore, however, would emerge shed into several separate beams: red, 
green, and blue, each shining clear. As well, this wrist-sized 
metal is mysteriously light.

An armchair is here, wrought purely of #1flame#0.~
   This is a large, plush-looking armchair. It looks as though 
it would be divinely comfortable in which to sit, if only it were 
not made of fire. Sitting in it would likely be a terrible idea.

a tiny kris dagger made of steel~
A tiny kris dagger forged of steel has been left here carelessly by an Eldritch.~
   Forged of tempered steel, this tiny dagger bears a distinctive 
wavy blade, about a half foot long and honed to a razor 
sharpness. Mystic runes have been etched onto the assymetrical 
blade, made dark with an agent of some sort. The handle has been 
carved of bone with a slight downturn, ending in the likeness of 
a snakes head with a closed mouth.
