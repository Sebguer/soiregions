Tharso BATTALIONS, Brutish, Fiery-eyed Charger Horse Stallion Graehim~
a brutish, fiery-eyed charger~
A brutish, fiery-eyed charger stands here proudly~
   A great, hulking brute of a horse, he displays few 
characteristics pleasing to the eye. Monstrous in proportion, he 
stands at seventeen hands with a barrel chest, powerfully corded 
muscles and a short, thick neck. His fierce, dappled grey form 
seems wholly foreign to speed, save for that provided by his long 
legged strides. Instead, he seems a beast made for strength, 
power and endurance, well capable of carrying his heavily 
armoured master into the thick of battle, or long distances, 
without flagging. With his fettered hooves nearly as large as a 
man's head, shod for war with edges equally sharp to ground or 
flesh, their can be little doubt about his status of a war 
stallion, were the fiery, brazen eyes not enough to tell.

a gigantic, bloodshot-eyed troll~
A gigantic troll, eyes injected with blood stands menacingly here.~
Gigantic, even for a troll, this creature stands on a pair of legs
thick as the ones of a mighty mumak. Covered on a flexible,
thick brownish hide, this beast seems to glisten permanently,
due to the pestilent sweat that comes from his every effort. A
pair of small pig-like eyes gaze to the world, constantly 
injected in blood. A massive maw, rimmed with yellowed
tooth seems to slaver all the time. His hands are enormous
and solid, and seem able to deal a terrible amount of damage
if clenched.

Havelmein BATTALIONS white coated black speckled stallion warhorse horse~
a black specked, white coated stallion~
A white coated stallion stands here, head raised arrogantly~
   Sixteen hands high, this stallion's shoulder reaches a height 
above that which most men's do. His coat is kept to a high 
sheen, specs of black upon a mostly white surface. More black 
encroaches upon the sea of white upon the animal's head, mostly 
upon the crown of its nose. A thick, strong body gives way to 
steady legs, casting what many would consider a formidable image. 
The creature seems to prance rather than walk, almost patrolling, 
high-stepping and self-important.

a sinewy, wild-haired man~
A sinewy, wild-haired man is here~
   Of a short and stocky build, this man appears to be somewhere 
in his late twenties. His weathered and pitted skin, darkened by 
nature and sun, almost seems pale in comparison to the wild, 
tangled mass of coal colored hair that drops from his scalp to 
his shoulders, and covers his chin in an unkempt beard. Grey 
eyes set beside an oft-broken nose merely emphasize the man's 
rugged and worn features. His legs, though short, are stout and 
seem appropriate in length to match the thick chest and arms 
above. Tattoos, mostly of a spiral and woven design mar his skin 
in numerous places, set alongside depictions of strange and 
mythical beasts.

a scarred, bald man of imposing physique~
A scarred, bald man of imposing physique watches with vigilance.~
   Eyes of both the color and austerity of iron watch everything 
that goes on about this man's heavily muscled body. The august 
chin and jowls are clean-shaven, as is the scalp above. A livid 
bluish scar goes from the left corner of his mouth to his right 
brow, causing his nose to be twisted and misshapen. His skin, 
though naturally pale, is nevertheless tanned, and any exposed 
tends to be covered with a criss-crossing of scars. Bushy black 
eyebrows adorn a high and noble forehead. The man's hands are 
beefy and scarred, the right one missing the two middle fingers. 
His back is carried straight, the heavy shoulders proudly back.

a graceful, light bay stallion~
A graceful, light bay stallion stands alertly.~
   His light reddish coat glistening, this stallions neck arcs 
gracefully beneath an ebon mane. An elegantly shaped head holds 
small, shapely ears and bright, expressive eyes, between which a 
bright star turns into a crooked race running down the muzzle. 
White socks on all four legs run up from the hoof to just below 
the black knees and hocks, which fade into the burnished light 
red of his body. His black tail is held proudly, and he steps 
lightly, with a spirited beauty born of good-breeding and a 
lifetime of fine care.

Strummer ARAPHOR coal-eyed salt-and-pepper-haired man Gelir~
a coal-eyed, salt-and-pepper-haired man~
A coal-eyed, salt-and-pepper-haired man stands here.~
Thick hair the color of salt and pepper roll down this man's skull,
well groomed and neatly cut as it ends at eyebrow level. Beneath two
thin black eyebrows reside coal-colored eyes, laughter lines crinkling
the corners of their sockets. Crows feet give this man a constantly
weary expression, and high cheekbones accentuate his thin nose. Full
lips finish off the facial features of this man. A single imperfection
mars his face, a white scar trailing its way across his right eye.
His neck bears a thin red mark, circling the entirety of it as it
forms into a muscular torso. Toned arms end in disproportionately slim
hands, callused at the palms. A proportionate size of hips leads to
long legs stood upright upon two whole feet.

an iron-eyed woman with onyx hair~
An iron-eyed woman with onyx hair stands here vigilantly.~
Piercing iron grey eyes sternly regard the world from beneath a haughty 
brow. With sharp cheekbones, a squared chin, and thin lips, there is no 
a part of this woman that seems warm or pliable. Even the contrast of 
her onyx hair against her alabaster skin seems harsh and unforgiving. 
Although her height is not extraordinary, her disdainful posture, her 
hard muscles, and her detached demeanor give an impression of strength 
and capability. From the lines around her eyes and the corners of her 
lips, this woman appears to be at the start of middle age although her 
athletic body shows little of the signs of wearing of age.

An aggressive, auto-create orcish Ithilien Underground Sentinel archer warrior is here.~
   The height of this orc is lessened by its hunched stance and bow
legged gait, yet it still moves with a savage and wary speed, muscles
woven tightly across its broad shoulders. With dark skin, marked with
many blemishes and scars, and suspicious eyes, the orc makes its way
across Arda. A most noticeable trait of this orc is the copious hair
that flows from its chin and head, strong braids knitted from the
coarse strands, many tied off with small bones or coins.

A rat is here.~
   The filth and disease that hang about this foul vermin are 
almost visible, yet where they are not the numerous sores and 
dirt spread about its body reminds any and all that the rat is 
truly a bearer of plagues and worse. Rather nimble despite its 
unhealthy condition, the rat never completely pauses, continually 
scurrying over the terrain before it, or turning its head this 
way and that. A sickening smell wafts from the fur of the rat, 
leaving little cuteness to it.

a long-clawed, white-skinned albino troll with a hammer head~
A large white-skinned troll with long claws and a hammer head menaces this area.~
   Tall and muscular, this troll has a leaner form than most 
trolls, though its head is the shape of a huge hammer, ears at 
each end of the mallet shape. Its eyes are a bright pink shining 
out from eyelids of a pure white, gnobbly skin. Its jaw clacks 
open and closed, dribble hanging from a set of long jet black 
fangs, some capped with steel tips. Great claws extend from long 
arms, ususally held above the ground, while the tips scrape along 
walls or other creatures. Keen-gaze suggests a mind sharper than 
the average troll.
