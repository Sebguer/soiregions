a long, wood-framed tent of oiled leather~
A long, wood-framed tent stretches along the ridge to the north.~
   A wooden frame has been constructed here, and oiled leather stretched over
it to form a makeshift housing. The tent is very lengthy, stretching along
the stone wall of the ridge to the north. The top is slanted, allowing water
to slide off when it rains. Entrances consisting of double-thick flaps to keep
the wind out have been placed at one end and along the side.

shanty $drabcolor paint WOOD ramshackle~
a ramshackle shanty painted $drabcolor~
A $drabcolor painted shanty has been built on the side of the street.~
   This shanty has been formed out of an eclectic combination of 
daub-and-wattle, wood, stone, and whatever else could be 
reasonably scavenged from the streets and made to hold together. 
An attempt to brighten up the ramshackle structure has been made 
through liberal application of paint, however the $drabcolor 
colour is decidedly underpowering. The door of this crude 
structure is, however, stout, secure, and looks as if it will 
survive long after the shanty inevitably collapses.

stakes cages spikes display severed heads remains iron WOOD~
a row bloodied stakes arrayed before a number of cages~
A row of bloodied stakes, many bearing heads upon them or raven-picked skulls upon them, have been arranged in a grisly semi-circle before the doors of the western gaolhouse. A number of iron cages are suspended from stout wooden poles that hang behind them.~
   Long shafts of dark wood jut out from the dirt ground here, 
many topped with the heads of those caught by the Black Watch in 
violating Krayd's Laws, thers ominously clean and blank for the 
moment. No small amount of the heads are now reduced to yellowed 
skulls, picked clean by the flock of predatory birds that hops 
from fresh head to fresh head, picking and tearing away at the 
rotting flesh. Behind the semi-circle of heads stands a number 
of cages, mewling, crippled forms both human and goblin in 
appearance bound within them, suspended off the ground. Frail 
legs and arms dangle through the heavy iron bars of the bloodied 
cages, accompanied by the occasional call for help or mercy as 
passing denizens in the market square stop on infrequently to 
poke and tease those trapped inside.
   #6You can 'survey heads' to take a closer look at the unfortunates,#0

a magnificent copper statue of a grim-faced, solidly-muscled man~
A magnificent copper statue of a grim-faced, solidly-muscled man rises above the Market Square, set on a carved block of marble.~
   Measuring fifteen feet from head to toe, and proportioned 
appropriately, this statue has been cast from copper, gleaming 
brightly in the presence of even the slightest of light. The 
precious metal has been set into the image of a grim-faced, 
solidly-muscled man, the intense eyes fashioned into a most 
imposing, imperious focus down at the market below. The figure's 
chin is held high, its lips set in a tight line, posture ramrod 
straight. The right hand is clasped in a fist and held at its 
left shoulder, while robes are postured as if in a slight breeze, 
wrapping around the man and concealing his lower half. A carved 
pedestal of pale marble, shaped in to a broad circle, is set 
beneath the statue.

A magnificent copper statue of a grim-faced, solidly-muscled man rises above the Market Square, currently being cleaned and polished by human slaves.~
   Measuring fifteen feet from head to toe, and proportioned 
appropriately, this statue has been cast from copper, gleaming 
brightly in the presence of even the slightest of light. The

marble, shaped in to a broad circle, is set beneath the statue, 
and surrounding it is a dozen slaves, working hard to polish and 
clean the statue from the weather's toil, doing so under the 
watchful eye of a pair of crest-helmed soldiers.

#6An OOC note for those who want to buy property is here.#0~
   In this room, your character can buy housing without immortal 
assistance. However, the levels of housing readily available en 
masse tends to be cheap, nasty, and far from desirable. Two 
styles of housing are available; rough shanties constructed in 
the human slums, and closed-off warrens available in the deep 
goblin warrens. 
   To purchase the keys to one of these houses, buy the box of 
the exact same colour; the box contains two keys (also of the 
same colour) that will unlock the shanty or warren of their 
colour, and no other. These keys will not be replaced lightly, 
so be sure to keep hold of them. 
   #1IMPORTANT!#0 The #6wooden#0 boxes contain the keys for the 
#6shanties located in the human slums#0. Likewise, the #6stone#0 
boxes contain the keys for #6the warrens located in the deep 
goblin warrens#0. It is highly suggested that your character buy 
housing appropriate to their species; orcs trying to live amongst 
humans or humans amongst goblins should expect a less than warm 
welcome from their neighbours. 
   The keys and boxes are near useless for any other purpose, and 
will not sell for even a fraction of their worth to or from other 
merchants. You are asked to only use them for locking and 
unlocking the automatic housing. 
   Lastly, refunds will only be given if for some reason the box 
has no keys within it. If this is the case, immediately send an 
email to the administrators with a log. Otherwise, no refunds 
will be given, ever. You buy a box, your blacks are gone. Be 
sure you know where the house is you're buying for, and that the 
box you're buying is the one you want before "accepting" the 
purchase.

froth build at the corners of his mouth, and he vaguely mutters,
almost in a state of delirium.

Shouts and screams of agony come from a writhing, agony-wracked man impaled on a sharpened wooden stake here.~
   This man has obviously invoked the wrath of the Black Watch of
Tur Edendor, and now pays for it with his life; the blunt point
of a massive wooden stake lurches from his chest, blood and
intestines slowly sliding it down it, accompanied by his frantic
shouts and screams for mercy. A crest-helmed member of the Black
Watch stands a short distance from this pitiful figure, watching
without expression or noise as the man dies all too slowly.

the stake in general. This man's face is frozen in to a horrible
dying scream, but his arms and legs hang limply, pulled down by
gravity to sway gently in the wind.

   A number of wooden stocks are here in the Punishment Round,
and this heavy set is clasped about the hands of a rough-looking
individual, his head hung in resignation, a strong smell of sweat
and fear about him. An occasional passerby stops to give him a
kick or hurl a rock at him before moving off with a laugh.

A small crowd has gathered about a naked man tied to a post being whipped red ad raw by a Black Watch soldier.~
   A crowd numbering perhaps a dozen individuals has gathered to
watch and cheer at the naked, scummy looking man tied to a stout
oak post in the Punishment Round, giving shouts and screams as
the whip of a nearby Black Watch soldier descends on his raw
flesh again, and again, and again. A number of other 
bronze-armoured soldiers stand guard nearby.

A sizable crowd has gathered about the gallows, a hooded man with a rope wrapped about his neck standing atop of it.~
   The man's soon-to-be-fate is obvious, even to the most dense,
drooling denizens of Tur Edendor; no small number of them have
gathered at the base of the gallows, eager to see the man, now
hooded and with a thick rope about his neck, plunge down from the
trapdoor and die. Black Watch soldiers stand about the gallows,
one particularly imposing Numenorean stand at the release handle.

extremities of the body have already begun to turn black, and a
foul smell arises from it, feces running down its legs.

A metal cage hanging from a stout pole is here, occupied by a despondent-looking goblin.~
   The metal cage is nothing fancy, just a box of iron bars, but
is obviously more than sufficient to enclose the despodent 
looking goblin inside it. Knees tucked up under his chin, face 
covered in dirt, this prisoner looks forlornly out across the
Market Square, completely naked.

   The metal cage is nothing fancy, just a box of iron bars, but
is obviously more than sufficient to enclose the frantic goblin 
inside. His frame is gaunt, and he shakes wildly at the stout 
bars, causing the cage to swing back and forth. Flecks of white
froth build at the corners of his mouth, and he vaguely mutters,
almost in a state of delirium.

of the remains suggesting he died of starvation.

Shouts and screams of agony come from a writhing, agony-wracked goblin impaled on a sharpened wooden stake here.~
   This goblin has obviously invoked the wrath of the Black Watch of
Tur Edendor, and now pays for it with his life; the blunt point
of a massive wooden stake lurches from his chest, blood and
intestines slowly sliding it down it, accompanied by his frantic
shouts and screams for mercy. A crest-helmed member of the Black
Watch stands a short distance from this pitiful figure, watching
without expression or noise as the goblin dies all too slowly.

   Decorating the thick wooden stake punctured through his chest
is a festive design of entrails and blood from this unfortunate
goblin, a thick swarm of flies buzzing about the gaping wound and
the stake in general. This goblin's face is frozen in to a horrible
dying scream, but his arms and legs hang limply, pulled down by
gravity to sway gently in the wind.

decomposed, his face a mismatch of flesh and picked-clean bone.

A large galleon has wrecked upon the dock here, the hull severely breached.~
   This is, or rather was, a large wooden galleon, one of the 
larger vessels commonly seen about Osgiliath's docks. This 
particular one was rigged as a trading vessel, with the steerage 
refitted to accommodate more cargo. Something has gone wrong, 
however, as this ship has crashed into the dock, its immense 
weight driving it in almost a third of the way up the hull. The 
centre mast has snapped clean in half, and crushed the forward 
cabin as it fell. The hull is beaten and torn, and it is easy to 
imagine you could enter the ship if you wished to. (#9OOC: ENTER

perhaps a storey and a half in height, and contains a platform 
with a canvas roof. Upon the platform is a reasonably large pile 
of organized lumber, several pitchers of oil, and flint and 
steel. It is evidently some kind of beacon, though the details 
of its use are perhaps unknown.

talisman bone fur fangs MAGIC WARG OTHER~
a talisman of bone decorated with fur and fangs~
A shaped piece of bone, fur and fang clutters the ground.~
   This talisman has been fashioned of many thin bands of 
yellow-white bones, curved in a rough, spherical shape from some 
beast's ribcage to look crudely like a heart. Tufts of thick fur 
and long, jagged fangs hang from the individual rib bones, tied 
on with thick sinew. Looking between the bones produces an odd 
sensation, the shadows and the other side of the talisman not 
quite matching up to the feeling in one's hand when holding it, 
as if the interior of the heart-shaped pieces of bone is bigger 
than the outside.

A heavy sable-hued pile of material has been left here.~
   The linen of this cassock drapes with unflattering stiffness 
about the wearer, the fabric luxuriant but oppressive in its 
weight, dyed completely black. The flared sleeves of the robe 
are hemmed with staples of iron and the opening of the garment 
from neck to navel is lined with crude clasps of the same metal. 
Where the last clasp ends the cassock hangs low to the wearers 
feet, the voluminous drape of the fabric obscuring all but the 
most pronounced movement of the legs.

black, reaching to the navel in front and the small of the back. 
It does not obstruct movement unduly, but it is obviously not 
much protection from the elements and is purely decorative wear.

a horrific, alabaster mask~
A horrific, alabaster mask sits here.~
   This horrific looking article shows signs of careful 
construction. The alabaster has been shaped into a slender mask 
that covers the wearer's face down to just above the jaw. There 
is a finger-wide slit that runs up the center from the bottom and 
just above the lip it becomes an arrowhead shaped gap that stops 
below the eye sockets. A piece of smoky metal runs down from the 
top to meet the point of the gap below the brow, and set in this 
metal are two polished, silver orbs. The smaller one sits at the 
top of the mask and the larger one is in the center of the 
forehead. Two blood-red lines extend halfway up the forehead 
from the hollow eyes sockets. When a hood is drawn over this 
mask, the exposed parts of the wearer's jaw as well as the eye 
sockets are concealed in darkness.

narrow wooden stair, rickety and unsound, climbs betwixt the

a sleek, muscled cuirass of blackened steel~
A cuirass fashioned from blackened steel, its form contoured with muscle lies here.~
   Two pieces of sleek, blackened steel compose this muscled 
cuirass piece. Whilst only lightly dented in places, the 
forepiece has been masterfully created to show the contours of a 
human form, the ripples of a stomach and the breast muscles most 
prominent and a dual, thick leather strap fastens the two pieces 
together. A soft leather backing has been riveted to the piece 
to prevent chafing or cuts from the angular cuirass and it 
appears to comfortably fit a perhaps more able-bodied individual.

Lying forgotten here is a blackened steel collar, its forefront etched with a raven.~
   This angular, thick piece of sturdy, blackened steel has been 
masterfully crafted to manifest above average protection for the 
wearer's neck. Composed of two parts, buckled on the neck by a 
double bronze and leather strap, its edges, where it meets the 
wearer's jaw-line, has been padded with a strip of thick, dark 
leather and moving down its piece, it opens slightly onto the 
collarbone area. Its steely surface shines a sleek, midnight 
black in colour. On the forefront of this steel collar is 
clearly etched a regal, sleek-black raven, its dull eyes tinted 
with a silver-grey colour as well as the sheen on its sharp beak.

   This finely crafted heater shield, has been carefully bent to

duller, grey or white, more akin to fog. Its edges have been 
smoothed and rounded to give it a neat finish and a thick, sleek 
black leather strap spans its backside for fastening to the 
wearer's back, shoulder or forearm. Emblazoned central to the 
fog-grey shield is an intricately etched, regal raven. The edges 
and very veins of its feathers have been detailed with thin, 
silvery lines and its eyeballs, likewise, have been etched with a 
dull white, its spider-black, beady pupils always boring forward 
with scrutiny.

helm full raven-head blackened steel UNIQUE_NARODAR METAL~
a raven-head full helm of blackened steel~
A helm of dark, midnight steel, akin to a raven's head, lies here, forgotten.~
   The contours, crevices, nooks and crannies of this blackened 
steel full helm have been skillfully manipulated to make manifest 
the resemblance of raven's head. All over the raven's black 
head, the steel has been forged to emulate its sleek, shadow 
feathers and intricate, light etchings mark the very veins in the 
feathers. Two beady, dark eyes have been carefully moulded into 
the helm's sides and tainted with a fine silver lining to portray 
the creature's very eyeballs. A prominent, sharp beaked shape 
ejects the main form of the helm roughly in accordance with the 
wearer's nose. The helm continues only a few inches below that 
point, leaving a gap for breathing though a chainmail coif has 
been riveted into the flat of it to hand lose over the neck.

around its occupant while allowing plenty of space for even the 
largest of men. An equally basic lid seals this coffin which if 
chosen could be nailed securely in place.

   Thick wool of fine weave has been used in the production of 
this comfortable woollen tunic. No collar tops this garment, 
instead the neck is shaped into a V shape, three buttons of 
polished bronze running down to just above the sternum on its 
wearer. The long sleeves reach down easily to the wrists, the 
cuffs flaring outward slightly as they end at the base of the 
hands. A splendid, pitch black dye has been used to color the 
wool. A clever pattern in silver has been skillfully embroidered 
from the V of the neck, down to the waist in a tapered fashion. 
Close inspection reveals the design to be similiar to elven 
runes, but are in fact mearly patterns sewn to resemble such.

   In shape this mask is oval, perhaps made of cast iron. There 
is an impression jutting outwards from where a humanoid's nose 
would most likely be with two elongated, smoothly rounded shapes 
flanking it. Directly below is another opening, likely made for 
ease of speaking. Predominantly the metal is a dull grey in 
color, even when shined it is eclipsed by the silver details. 
More precious metal encircles the outer rim of the mask, twining 
off in sharp spirals over the duller metal but also tracing the 
orifices for the eyes and mouth. A sturdily-crafted strap is 
used to hold it onto a wearer's head.

lance DO_NOT_LOAD shortened vicious oak UNIQUE_PRUDJAK WOOD~
a vicious, shortened lance of oak~
A vicious, shortened lance of oak lies here.~
   This weapon is crafted for one thing and one thing alone: to 
gore and impale savagely and efficiently. A blackened pole of 
solid oak makes up the shaft of this lance and leads upward to 
sprout a triangular-shaped, black-iron spearhead. The shaft has 
been shortened, sawed off and smoothed at the bottom, making the 
entire weapon stand little more than three-to-four feet high. 
The shape of the iron head ensures that any wound inflicted by it 
wouldn't close easily, and to further the vicious, grizzled look 
to the weapon serrated cuts have been hacked into the iron head's 
edges. All in all, this weapon looks lethal and could easily be 
devastating in the hands of a skilled user.

#5A seedy, shady, shifty drug pusher directs sales and purchases of large quantities of khaskhas here, dealing with rabble, junkies, street dealers, and all other sorts of individuals.~
   This drug pusher sticks to the shadows and corners of the drug 
den so much that it is hard to tell anything of his features, 
even whether he is human or orc. Denizens of many different 
walks filter in to the den to talk to him, the majority buying 
small sacks and pouches for exorbitant sums of money. About him 
stand perhaps half a dozen bodyguards, including a huge, 
lumbering troll chained to the wall. He speaks with countless 
obscenities laced in his language, and everyone in the den seems 
more than eager to fulfill his orders.

   The features of this corpse are somewhat indescribable, now, 
the skin drawn deeply with rents, cuts and picked boils and scabs 
as if someone has been constantly clawing at it. Tattered rags 
cover the corpse though little effort has been made, clearly, to 
remove them from this rotting creature.

A crumbling establishment lined with rags and planks sits here off the road.~
   This shanty looks to have only been recently abandoned, and 
thick marks of red paint has been splattered over the boarded-up 
doors and windows of the building. All those who pass by seem to 
give it a wide berth.

A corpse riddled with welts and boils lies here, limp, its throat cut a knife in their hand.~
   A haggard, bony corpse lies here, inanimate, on the roadside. 
Despite bony and acute features, the corpse is riddled with a 
myriad of welts, boils and scabs. An apparent act of suicide, 
the throat of this corpse has been hastily and roughly split 
open, the skin loosely torn and ripped. A sharp, wood-handled 
knife is grasped in one of the bone-white hands.

A dirty, haggard man covered in boils is aggressively beaten here by figures in dark-bronze platemail.~
   This man cowers, hunching up as his thinly-armoured body of 
tatty leather is beaten by crested figures bearing blunt objects: 
clubs, sticks, fists. He wails out in pain, the noise shrilly 
piercing the air.

myriad of addicts, it seems. Predominantly men, they move around 
in their small group near the streets here begging for money or 
Khaskkhas, unaware of the presence of the bronze-attired Black 
Watch. They smell disgusting and a few of them show signs of 
boils and welts on their skin.

An enormous, ironclad tome of thick black leather~
An enormous tome, bound in very thick black leather, with ornate iron framing has been affixed to a pedestal here.~
   This tome is truly enormous, approximately a yard and a half 
when opened up, and has been made from some curiously thick 
leather of some sort, dyed deepest black. It rests upon a 
wrought iron pedestal that has been bolted to the ground, the top 
of the pedestal opening up and out like a clawed hand, holding 
the book firmly in place. The book itself has been lined along 
the spine, the outsides, and crossing both the front and back 
with iron bands, which, under a certain angle of light, seem to 
show foreign and mysterious looking runes all over. The pages 
themselves are some kind of silver leaf, obviously pressed by a 
master artisan, and the tengwar are intricitely inscribed in a 
dusted-gold ink. Needless to say the watchmen in the area tend 
to stand close by to this tome.

whole book is attached to a plain iron stand. This tome sits

down to his shoulders. He stands with a group of Slavers, 
distributing out prizes to those gladiators who survived the 
brutal combat of the Pits. Behind him, in the southern wall, are 
ten cages, some containing wargs, the others empty. For those 
with a wild warg to hand to the slaver for a few coins, type 
#6handover warg#0 - however, he will only take the toughest and 
most brutal of wild wargs.

well rounded and polished to a rich shine. A heavy square of 
copper has been welded to the top of the ring, and engraved upon 
this portion is a skillful depiction of battle, the picture 
capturing the gruesome, grimacing profile of a warrior. On the 
inside of the ring, a smaller, rougher symbol of a cracking whip 
is to be seen when the ring is not on someone's finger.

a polished, engraved, copper bracer~
A polished copper bracer, heavily engraved, lies here.~
   This thick copper bracelet is designed to clasp down on one's 
forearm from wrist to mid-forearm, sealed by three intricate 
pin-clasps, the seam of the metal hard to distinguish from the 
well-polished copper of the piece. Engraved on the top side of 
the bracer is a skillfully depicted scene of a raging battle 
within a great fighting pit, showing humans, orcs, goblins, wargs 
and even a troll battle amongst each other. Although each 
individual figure is engraved rather small, there is enough 
detail to clearly distinguish race and species.

   The burly man here stands above a pit carved out to 
specifically accomodate a pair of starved wargs brought in to 
fight for the benefit of the tavern goers. He bears a heavy 
brass gong, and a thick cudgel in his one hand, clearly waiting 
for a crowd to gather before announcing a fight. He notices your 
interest, and explains how the fights work to you... 

#6OOC#0: To begin a fight, type '#6start fight#0'. The two 
wargs, one coloured blue, the other red, will fight until their 
death. After the fight is complete, it will be 15 Real Life 
minutes before another can be launched. 

You can make bets before the fight buy purchasing them from the 
one-handed boy as you would normally buy things, but #9#6TAKE 
NOTE#0 that these tokens, both red and blue, will last for only 
15 Real Life minutes before becoming old. Thus, buy them just 
before you decide to launch a warg fight. Once the fight is 
over, you can resell them to the boy, depending on who won the 
fight. 

You can examine how the two wargs are doing by typing '#6look 
wargs'#0.

   This large plaque has been fitted on one of the massive blocks 
of stone that forms the western archway over the pits, fashioned 
out of brass and kept well polished by whoever tends to the 
Arena. Enscribed upon it, in the Adunaic tongue in 
Numenian-Tengwar characters, is the following: 

"Krayd Nadilith, Duke of These Lands and Ruler of Tur Edendor, 
extends his heartfelt thanks to those who value their city above 
their own selves, and saw fit to donate considerable sums of 
money, resources and effort to see the construction of these fine 
Fighting Pits, which will no doubt bring people from far and wide 
to witness the spectacles that shall unravel here. Two names 
rise above those flint-hearted and miserly folk of the city - 
   Kadar-Lai Ralan Odulun, humble as a butcher of the city, but 
without reproach in his generosity and love for his city. 
   Kadar-Lai Barskh the Pale, famed for the mighty armours he 
crafts to outfit the soldiers of Tur Edendor as well as his 
generous donations to see that the city grows strong."

a masterly-wrought dark steel breastplate~
A very well crafted breastplate in dark steel and adorned in runes lies here.~
   This wide piece of dark steel is forged by skillful hands to 
provide an immense protection for its wearer with little concern 
for appearance, consisting of two functional body-shaped pieces 
of unyielding metal with thick leather backing and pauldrons 
reaching out across the shoulders. It is thick, yet light and 
covered in barbaric symbols and etchings; the mark of a 
barrel-shaped cage is set across the front flanked with two rows 
of runes running down on each side. The breastplates uneven 
surface is shiny due to its material, but reflects lights in an 
oily and obscured fashion. It's a piece of armour built purely 
for functionality and not for show.

simple hinges in the back. It is two palms in width and provides 
immense protection for the neck and throat, lining with leather 
on the inside reduces impact and gives increased comfort. The 
small plate with a peg that locks the ring together carries a 
single large rune.

#5A spherical, staggeringly fat troll and a suave, pointy-nosed goblin stand by, the goblin calling out for people to come and try their luck in the stone toss game.~
   A troll of immense proportions, but almost as round as he is 
wide, stands here in the caverns, chained to the waist of a 
rather suave and well dressed goblin with a terrifically pointy 
nose. The pair stand before a long pit of dirt, where two stones 
lie, one marked with a white dot, the other with a black dot. 
The goblin shouts up and down the length of the cavern, trying to 
convince passerbys to enter in a game to see whether they can 
best the troll in a game of hurling the massive stones. 

#6To play the stone tossing game, have a single 5-Head piece in 
your hand, and type #9#6toss rocks#0#6. If you win, you'll 
receive double your money back. Those with fantastic strength 
will find they've a greater chance at winning.#0

vainly-applied, reinforced waistline does little more than 
demonstrate the difference from top and bottom, the garment 
sweeping to the floor with a straight cut. It has been dyed a

A short, stag-antler trident has been left carelessly here.~
   This trident is composed of a simple oak wood shaft, to which 
a stag's antler has been bound using thick leather cording. The 
antler has been narrowed to three sharp tines branching from its 
base, each sharpened wickedly to a point. The trident is 
relatively shaft-heavy and short, making it awkward to wield in 
one hand but difficult to wield in two unless of a certain 
stature, and would be quite ineffective if thrown. A quarter of 
the way down the shaft a scarred iron band gives some measure of 
protection against splintering, and more leather cording has been 
wrapped below it to offer a secure grip. The shaft's butt has 
been fire blackened and notched several times on one side.

a vicious, black-bladed sword of sharpened steel~
On the ground here lies a jet-colored sword with a noticable ornament hammered upon the hilt~
   This formidable weapon, of a slightly longer length than the 
average shortsword, is comprised of heavily blackened steel, 
giving it's blade a sleek jet-colored hue. The blade appears to 
have been religiously sharpened, and presents a vicious edge, 
slightly serrated. The hilt, made of some unidentifiable wood, 
is wrapped hastily in worn leather, giving it a solid grip. 
Attached to the bottom of the hilt is a hastily-forged fist, made 
of black iron.

   Formed of oaken planks bound together with strips of bronze and
iron studs, this broad shield has been painted a plain black, its
center adorned with a grey Full Moon. This insignia is now the
pupil of a large, red eye which is wreathed about the entirety of
the shield's curved surface, dug deep into the layered wood. Thick
arrow shafts protrude from this shield at irregular angles, giving
it a worn appearance. A pair of straps upon the shield's backing allow
for it to be easily strapped to one's arm or back.

A black-hafted, twin-bladed steel polearm has been carefully placed here.~
A pair of viciously arced, curving blades have been expertly affixed to a
long haft of steel plated hardwood, gleaming and honed to a very fine edge.
The steel blades bear a smoky hue, gleaming from atop the blackened shaft,
and show the qualities of master craftsmanship, while runes and figures gleam
upon the plated pole, standing out against the darkness. Locked in positions of
pain and fear, these etched figures provide a firm, rough grip against the
otherwise smooth steel, and overall this weapon seems as if it could be
quite terrible in the right hands.

worn the series of layered femurs, humerus, and other bones hang 
down to the knees each bound into the adjacent bones with thick, 
tough cords of sinew. The construct while rather haphazard in 
appearance is quite pliable, and the coverage is pervasive. Hung 
from the belt along with the bones of the skirt is a large 
cavebear skull, selectively covering the groin of the wearer.

A pile of bone, and crude iron sits here forgotten.~
   A makeshift harness of braided sinew holds this long bib into 
place, looping under the armpits and over the shoulders before 
tying off behind the neck. The actual bib hangs low, widening 
from top to bottom as it reaches down to well past the belly 
button. It is made up mostly of various sizes of rib bones 
tightly bound together with thick, tough strips of sinew. The 
natural curve of the rib bones is used to create the taper of the 
bib, allowing for increased mobility of the arms and protection. 
Among the the surprisingly pliable and pervasive covering of bone 
can be seen various misshapen plates, scales, and scraps of iron 
which have been tied haphazardly onto the piece of armor.

#6an OOC sign about citizenry#0~
#6An OOC sign hangs over the desk of an official here, explaining about citizenry, NPCs and gate guards.~
   1. If a PC, or NPC, does not have the clan "Denizen of 
Mordor", the gate guards will not open if they knock. The 
gateguards will also attack any such PC or NPC on sight, and 
shoot at them with arrows if they are outside the city. 

2. If a NPC does have the clan "Denizen of Mordor", and they are 
set as a doorguard (given a key to a door and told to stand in 
front of it), they will open the door for anyone with the clan 
who knocks. They can also travel in and out of the city without 
any hassle. 

3. Both PCs and NPCs without the clanning are safe to walk 
around the city, they just cannot leave it, nor should attempt to 
go through the gates. HOWEVER, if a NPC is set to be aggressive, 
and without "Denizen of Mordor" clanning, it will probably attack 
everything in its path in the city, and the Black Watch will 
attack it in turn. 

4. The exception to this is if the PC or NPC is subdued, in 
which case they can be dragged through the gates. They should 
not be released until they are a few rooms away from the western 
side of the gates, as they will still be shot at. 

That understood, in this room there are two helpful commands: 

#6check status#0: this command is for PCs or NPCs. It will tell 
you, and the room, whether you are safe to pass through the gates 
or not. 

#6change status#0: only NPCs may use this command, but PCs can 
command NPCs they control to use it. This command will either 
grant, or remove, "Denizen of Mordor" clanning to the NPC that 
uses. It is to be used for setting your NPCs to the way you want 
them to behave, given the conditions described above.

a deep chalice of beaten iron~
A deep chalice of beaten iron is here, a dark eye set upon it.~
   Foraged from dark iron this chalice bears a deep and evenly 
rounded bowl, a long and sweeping handle flowing smoothly down 
from its base. Set upon the outside of the bowl, wrapping about 
its entire side is a swirling dark eye, numerous scratches 
obscuring the pattern at irregular intervals.

a large, bronze detailed cauldron of blackened iron~
A large cauldron of blacked iron has been set upon a high marble slab.~
   Made of smooth and heavily polished blackened iron, this 
cauldron is of large proportions, upheld by ornately detailed and 
wickedly flanged legs of solid bronze. The dark detailing 
travels up around the circumference of this large cauldron, 
swirling patterns of bronze built up before sprouting over the 
rim and flanging outwards like razor teeth. Within the cauldron 
sits a large amount of thick crimson blood, chunks of flesh and 
other such matter swirling about within the red masses.

   This staff is long, standing about a head shorter than a man, 
crooks and all. The staff is far from straight, twisted in all 
sorts of jagged angles and sporting a series of knobs. The most 
noticable thing about this staff is the intact human skull set at 
its top, missing only the lower jawbone.

fountain regal xAntrozous_bathouse marble STONE~
a regal marble fountain~
A regal fountain carved in the shape of a man and woman stands here, water flowing into the pool below in a constant stream.~
   Carved of pearly marble, this fountain is a splendorous image 
of majesty. Two figures stand next to each other, one male, the 
other female. The male stands crouched, dressed in naught but a 
leaf skirt. Carried in his arms is a bow that he has drawn back, 
the point of the notched arrow aimed upwards as if he intends to 
shoot at the sky. The musculature of his frame has been 
intricately carved out down to the most minute detail, making him 
look rather life-like. The female holds herself in a more 
fragile posture; the artist shaped her body so that it would be 
the envy of most any of her sex. One arm is held lightly out 
towards the man as if in longing, with her features carved into a 
look of dolor. It is not a peerless work, but is a fine 
juxtaposition of the strong and tender sex. The fountain itself 
is raised perhaps ten feet off the ground so that these two stand 
tallest of anything in the room, a mound of rocks have been 
heaped up at its base and are tangled with vines. Water spouts 
out, away from the statue, and cascades down onto the rocks, and 
eventually into the shallow pool.

A shallow, tranquil bath spans most of the length and width of the room.~
   Rose petals are scattered all throughout the water in this 
large bath, the water only gently rippling because of the stream 
from the fountain. The water is always kept hot, but not 
scalding. The bath is designed so that one would only be 
standing in waist-high water at the deepest point. A stone bench 
runs along the edge of the bath so that one could sit in the 
water while still keeping one's head above water. There are 
several other benches scattered through the center of the bath, 
all of these with back and arm-rests. It would almost never be 
crowded or clamorous here due to its size and limited use.

   This arm clearly belonged to someone at one time, but was 
ripped out of the shoulder join with great force. The hands 
imply its origin is human but much beyond that is hard to tell as 
it has been seperated from its original owner for days at least.

   Raw and a bit putrid, this chunk of flesh, skin, bone and 
sinew looks quite a bit like it was ripped from a human body. 
More precisely, part of the thigh, hip and lower torso, a few 
dangling bits of organs still attached. There are a few bite 
marks on the ends and the flesh seems to have been largely 
removed making serious identification difficult.

a giant rack of crude meat-hooks~
A giant rack of crude meat hooks is here, unwholesome hunks of meat and flesh dangling within it.~
   This long, crude wooden frame is made of rough hewn lumber and 
exists just to support some twisted bars of rough iron. On 
closer inspection the 'hooks' themselves are bits of window 
frame, door braces and other pieces of simple human crafting that 
have been brutally bent and twisted into a hook like shape. The 
hooks themselves serve only as a crude means to hang large, raw 
chunks of meat. The stink of rotting flesh clings to the whole 
thing, making it clear that the quality of the meat itself is of 
little concern to whoever owns this gruesome furnishing.

hundreds of strips of leather riveted together with metal studs

poorly cut, the rivets in places are missing or falling out and 
some of the strips have disappeared entirely, leaving large

An enshrouding, hooded charcoal grey bisht is left here, its hood draping down the back.~
   Made of fine-woven cotton, this garment is formed from a 
simple rectangular shape. It falls over the shoulders and leads 
almost seamlessly over the wearer's arms, covering just short of 
the knuckles of the hand. It has been cut on a bias to allow the 
material to drape perfect, its charcoal grey color darkening into 
the shadows of the abundant folds. The opening in the front 
overlaps slightly and subtly fastens closed with small, black 
wooden toggles. A short v-shaped neckline displays a narrow 
standing collar and has been embellished with an embroidered trim 
of coiling grey serpents and silvery grey crescent moons. 
Attached to the back is a deep hood with a thick, stiffened trim, 
which allows the hood to overshadow the wearer's face without 
falling into the eyes.

   Made of shining steel and chased with gold in delicate 
traceries of exotic vines and fruit, this exquisitely crafted 
helm is stamped along its edges with a repeating design of snakes 
and moons. A tiny gold snake and cresent moon, simple and

side. It is veiled across the front with a delicately made 
chainmail swathe that hangs to the shoulders all around the helm. 
The mail is as subtle and thin as lace, but strong.

A stark white jupon has been discarded here.~
   This jupon has been made of thick, durable wool - dyed stark 
white - underlaid with a soft, supple leather jack. It has no 
sleeves, but it extends down past the wearer's waist, covering 
the upper thighs. It does not look to have be buttoned or 
fastened up in any way, instead simply slipping on over whatever 
the owner is wearing. Across the chest and back are matching 
black dyed images of a blowfly, upside down with its legs in the 
air. The detail is fairly simple and as it is one colour it 
looks like a silhouette. The style of the jupon is fairly plain, 
with no ruffles or frills, and plain, masked stitching.

the legs in the air - has been emblazoned in a shallow engraving

aba ghost-white wool UNIQUE pZAREK TEXTILE~
a fine, ghost white wool aba~
A fine, ghost white wool aba lays here, silver threads catching the light.~
   A type of cloak, this aba is made from several large, 
rectangular panels of ghostly white wool. Closely woven with 
fine threads, the fabric is softer and thinner than average and 
does a beautiful job of deterring wind and rain. With a deep 
hood that can prevent the wearer's face from the elements, the 
cloth flows in a regal manner about the ankles. A set of three 
silver buttons fasten to cloth loops along the chest. Exquisite 
embroidery has been worked throughout much of this garment in a 
silvery grey thread as ethereal fog-like tendrils, creeping up 
from the bottom hem and swirling about the edges of the hood in 
such a manner that it nearly seems to appear and disappear as 
light moves over it.

edges hemmed, almost invisibly, to prevent fraying and to give it 
durability when worn tied about the arm. A black figure of a 
leaf has been patched in its center, the edges unevenly stitched 
with black thread and wrinkling slightly to give it a serrated 
and charred look.

a fingers length from it's base, leaving jagged edges behind. 
The helm only covers the crown of the head, except for the 
noseguard which extends far down and partially covers the mouth 
as well. Its iron surface is well polished, yet faint marks and 
dents indicate it has seen many battles.

a pointed pair of belled, $color linen slippers~
A pointed pair of belled, $color linen slippers have been left here.~
   Soled with durable leather, these slippers are formed of 
$color fine linen, making them soft and comfortable to move in. 
With toes that come to a sharp point in the front, the vamp 
curves subtly upward, both at the tips and against the foot. A 
wide mouth ensures it easily slips on and off the wearer's foot, 
and simple silvery grey embroidery of fanning scallops 
embellishes the edges. Accenting its embroidery, trios of 
delicate, silver bells have been attached around the slipper's 
mouth, creating a soft tinkling sound whenever the wearer walks.

   This loose-fitting shirt is made of $color cotton. A 
three-inch slit laces up the chest with leather cord into the

fold back into slightly flared cuffs. The bottom hem hangs to 
the wearer's hips, bearing short, twin vents on either side to 
allow easier movement.

A ghost white birch necklace with a carved medallion lays here.~
   This wooden medallion hangs down the center of a black silk 
cord. Ghost white birch makes up the carved medallion, depicting 
a snake coiling around a boar tusk. The carved tusk of this 
piece hangs in a downward angle where the cording fits through it 
as the snake faces out from the wearer, its eyes having been 
stained in a darker manner.

a braided bronze ring set with jade~
A braided bronze ring with a jade stone lies on the ground, collecting dust.~
   Made of bronze polished to a fine sheen, this ring presents 
itself as a flattering, subtle image. Three braided strips form 
the band of the ring, traveling in a circle towards an oval 
shaped piece of deep green jade that runs parallel to the 
wearer's finger. Holding the stone in place, two claws of bronze 
wind from either side of the braided band, each curved in a 
delicate tapered crescent as they reach towards the ends of the 
stone.

A frayed, stinking leather tunic lies here in a heap.~
   This tunic is nothing more than a piece of stinking leather 
sewn into the crude shape of a humanoid torso. The edges of the 
material are frayed, and on the whole the piece looks to be used 
very little for protection and moreso for clothing.

A pair of fingerless leather gloves lie here, an eye-socket visible on the backs.~
   The back and palm area of this glove is padded with thick 
layers of leather. The tips of each finger have been crudely cut 
off so that the wearers finger tips would be exposed. The glove 
offers good protection to the back and palm of the hand but 
leaves the fingers vulnerable. The back of each glove displays 
an empty eye-socket wreathed in flames.

An etched ring of bronze rests here, a crimson topaz set in its center.~
   A polished bronze band, edges gently rounded smooth, has been 
etched with elegant scrollwork on both sides, leading up to a 
raised, central setting. The focal point of this ring is a rare 
crimson topaz, its striking red hue contrasting attractively with 
the thin halo of azure lapis lazuli that surrounds it. The 
scrollwork changes at the bottom of the band, transitioning into 
the elegant script of Numenian-Tengwar to unveil the word 
'harmony' before winding back into the ornate pattern once more.

a mountain-carved ring of translucent white jade~
A white jade ring lies here, carved with the figure of a mountain.~
   Fashioned of white jade, this ring's stone quality is 
unmatched, having a luminous translucence to it. Bearing 
whirling etches around the band, the design is nearly invisible 
unless examined carefully. However, the centerpiece of the ring 
is its majestic, solitary mountain, shown in profile and with a 
seemingly deliberate discoloration in the stone which streaks the 
carving with pale browns and murky greens. Judging from its 
width and size, this ring would be better suited for a man's 
finger.

A white jade ring lies here, etched with a whirling setting.~
   Fashioned of white jade, this ring's stone quality is 
unmatched, having a luminous translucence to it. All around the 
delicate band, a subtle mountain range has been carved, a detail 
typically overlooked by the casual observer. The focus of the 
ring, however, is a stylized design of whirling gusts etched into 
the center setting, the pearlescent surface flecked with pale 
ribbons of azure.

   This long strip of cotton has been dyed a deep crimson color, 
its edges neatly hemmed, almost invisibly, to prevent fraying and 
to give it durability when worn tied about the arm. In the 
center of the cloth, three figures of equal size have been 
outlined in dark violet embroidery: a skeletal man flanked by a 
powerful bull and a coiling serpent.

an elegant, black-beaded, $color beledi~
An elegant, black-beaded, $color beledi lies here.~
   This elegant beledi dress is made from fine, lightweight 
$color linen and has been cut on the bias so that it naturally 
clings to the wearer's curves. A draping cowl neckline sweeps 
dangerously low and reveals the black, low-cut choli underneath. 
Its gauzy sleeves are tight to the elbows where it dramatically 
flares out to the wrists, the hem embellished with tiny black 
beads in a stylized figure of a gracefully twisting ribbon. 
Falling from the waist to the ankles in a subtly flaring cut, the 
skirt splits up to the hip on each side, offering teasing peeks 
of the wearer's legs. The skirt's hems are edged in black thread 
and beaded and embroidered with the continuing ribbon motif.

A flowing gown of $color cotton drapes delicately on the floor.~
   Dyed a beautiful $color, this gown is formed primarily of 
smooth, lustrous cotton. With a fitted, square-necked bodice, it 
laces on at the sides with black silken cord, displaying the 
feminine curves of the wearer. Long, fluttering sleeves drape 
over the arms in translucent gauze to cover most of the hand. 
Simple, but elegant needlework scrolls around the belled cuffs 
and nearly hides a cord along the sleeves, which allows them to 
be gathered up and out of the way. The skirt flows from the 
waist in flowing, gored cotton panels and has been layered with 
gauze cotton, giving the dress a delicate, sheer quality without 
sacrificing modesty.

A three legged, contoured mahogany chair rests here.~
   This rather large and comfortable three legged chair is built 
from solid mahogany. A solid piece of the rich wood curves 
gracefully to form the chair's back. The back is braced by the 
wide arms of the chair which seem as if they embrace the entire 
edges of the seat. The arms curve out from the back as if in a 
wide embrace. The seat is a marvel in it's shape. In a soft 
curving wide U shape the seat curves around from the back along 
the line of the arms with a wide opening in the middle. The seat 
is deep set to allow comfort and contours with the gently curving 
back. The legs are sturdy and thick. Two legs support either 
side of the front of the wide U shaped seat and one thick leg 
supports the back. The back, arms and legs are heavily carved 
with figures of women in varying stages of pregnancy. The seat 
is smooth and shows no carvings. The chair is slightly taller 
than most.

   Consisting of three pieces of fine mahogany, this chair sits 
low to the ground in a slightly angled backward position for 
comfort. A thick wedge of the wide smooth wood is secured to the 
underside of the gently angled seat. A long, wide plank of the 
fine wood acts as the back of the chair. The back is carefully 
angled to match the slope of the seat. The odd looking chair has 
no arms but a wide seat and high back to support the head. Thick 
leather straps are attached to either side of the seat and and 
back.

A scandalously sheer, pristine white wrap skirt is here, exquisitely embellished in white.~
   Made of luxuriously airy chiffon, this garment is scandalously 
translucent. In a pristine white color, the skirt ties about the 
wearer's waist and sits dangerously low on the hips, the knot and 
excess cloth strategically draping in front. It splits 
completely down the middle, offering flashes of flesh as it 
swirls about the legs with the slightest movement. Heavily 
embellished, sparkling white glass beads create a fringe along 
the hem, further accented by unfurling embroidery throughout, 
almost unseen if not for the contrasts of opacity. Several tiers 
of the small beads wrap around the upper half in lines and 
draping scallops, providing negligible modesty.

Shimmering white silk ribbon lines the hems to provide

as it falls over the shoulder, and a V-neckline cuts low in the 
front, tied together by the ribbon and displaying an unhindered 
view of cleavage. Swirling embroidery follows the curve of the 
wearer's bust, becoming more heavily stitched and beaded toward 
the center the only semblance of modesty due to the translucent 
quality of the cloth.

a daringly sheer, $finecolor wrap skirt~
A daringly sheer, $finecolor wrap skirt is here, heavily embellished in gold.~
   Made of luxuriously airy chiffon, this garment is scandalously 
translucent. A beautiful $finecolor, the skirt ties about the 
wearer's waist and sits dangerously low on the hips, the knot and 
excess cloth strategically draping in front. It splits 
completely down the middle, offering flashes of flesh as it 
swirls about the legs with the slightest movement. Heavily 
embellished, gold beads create a fringe along the hem, further 
accented by unfurling embroidery throughout. Several tiers of 
golden beads wrap around the upper half in lines and draping 
scallops, providing negligible modesty.

a wicked, lustrous black-steel valgash~
A lustrous steel-black valgash lies here, its blades wickedly sharp.~
   This balanced weapon has been constructed of lustrous black 
steel forged into a weighty five foot long pole and then wrapped 
in black leather. At the end of the pole is a pair of crescent 
shaped blades coming to a sharp point in the middle. Resembling 
a twin headed glaive slightly a pair of a tassels are tied to 
where the head meets the haft. This weapon could likely function 
as a spear or a pole-arm and still function in a lethal fashion 
in either capacity.

A bristly helm of dark iron set with one bent horn lies here.~
   Made from two pieces of unyielding dark iron, this thick and 
crude helmet consists of a skull cup that extends downwards to 
protect the neck - and a face mask that can be opened on simple 
and sturdy iron hinges. The skull cup is set with a multitude of 
small thorns, and one big protruding metal horn that is set on 
the top of the skull and bends forward to a vicious point. The 
face mask is feral, with prominent eyebrows, cheeks and nose with 
two thick metal crossbars going down on each side of the mouth to 
cover only the most important lines with simple efficiency.

a silver-adorned, scarlet-tinted scimitar~
A silver-adorned scimitar lays here, its blade bearing a subtle red hue. ~
   Roughly three and a half feet in length, this scimitar appears 
to have been crafted remarkably well. The polished blade has 
been crafted from high quality steel; the metal bearing a subtle 
scarlet hue, which appears more noticeable towards its centre. 
The razor-sharp edge has been sharpened to the point of giving it 
an austere viciousness. The hardwood hilt has been enveloped in 
onyx black leather, ensuring a functional grip. Made from 
polished steel, the handguard has been intricately detailed with 
silver; depicting whirling patterns that extend to the portion of 
the base of the blade. The pommel, somewhat oval shaped at the 
end of the hilt, has been crafted from unadorned steel, serving 
as an effective counter-weight. Overall, the scimitar appears to 
be finely-crafted; obviously efficient in the hands of a skilled 
wielder.

rectangular panels of $finecolor wool. Closely woven with fine 
threads, the fabric is softer and thinner than average, yet still 
does a beautiful job of deterring wind and rain. A set of three 
silvery buttons fasten to cloth loops along the chest. With a 
deep hood that can protect the wearer's face from the elements, 
the cloth flows in a regal manner about the ankles, billowing out 
when the wearer walks and lending an imposing air.

This key is made of polished and slightly worn brass. Long in length it has a rounded head with a hole in it so it might be strung on something. It ends in a series of long teeth, noched randomly to the untrained eye.

   This sprawling pile of debris seems consisted of anything and 
everything imaginable from the simple tattered raw hides and 
moth-eaten cloth, to bits of broken armor plates and scales, 
parchment scraps, bent iron sword blades or seeming gnawed maces, 
to whole sides of some unidentifiable rotting animal and broken

A wooden stage takes up much of the room, darkly-stained.~
   This wooden platform is rather large and raised high above the 
tables and chairs surrounding it. It is relatively plain and 
unadorned, with a few curious blotches on its already 
darkly-stained wood, and several of the wooden planks look to 
have been replaced recently. Several other planks are nicked, 
gouged or scuffed - giving the impression that this stage may 
double for putting on shows of a more aggressive bent.

A cut up male corpse, hung by rope from the branches here.~
   With rope looped around his neck and tied back to a branch of 
a tall tree, this man suffered before he died. The majority of 
his raggedy clothing has been stained deep-black from his own 
leaked lifeblood. His skin is punctured visibly on the arms and 
legs and in the obvious tatters of his rags. His hair, once a 
light blond, is tarnished by the same and his eyes have been 
closed over by the congealed crimson. His posture is twisted, 
his death mask a twisted view into the depths of pain, with the 
spottily visible skin a blue, dead hue and a permanent noiseless, 
screaming mouth and swollen tongue.

   This is the body of a bashed and battered woman, the length of 
her covered in purple and yellow bruising, many of these bruises 
softly decorated with a hint of blood. Caught in the maw of two 
branches by her feet, her back atop a particularly strong one, 
and her hands formed in a deathgrip on the bark on either side of 
her, her head lolls back into space, her neck fluid and loose, as 
if broken. The wind plucks at her dark hair as it hangs down 
away from her skull. Wearing not a stitch of clothing, this 
woman is obviously dead and died painfully too - her face is 
wrought with the terror of her assailant's actions upon her.

   The torso of a thickly muscled man has been gruesomely stuck 
onto the end of a branch here, his arms deadweights at his sides. 
The bottom portion of him has been ripped away and as such, a 
good degree of organ trails out from his insides and has been 
wrapped around the branch, further hinting that the man has been 
made one with the tree. His features, once handsome, have been 
thrown into a lockjawed expression of sudden shock and anguish, 
his decaying eyes bulging from the sockets. Faintly 
pitter-pattered from the macabre spectacle are the odd drops of 
blood, still leaking from the piece of body.

at random. A single torn off foot has fallen away from its twin, 
which has been wedged in between a set of 'v' branching branches 
so forcefully that it has half collapsed on itself, bone 
splinters peaking through the top of it. All around, hands, 
fingers, intestine, pieces of heart, bits of lung, noses and 
eyeballs, even the occasional ear, have been staked onto 
branches, floated on pools of congealing blood, tangled in with 
branches or just adhered to tree bark by virtue of their own 
fluids. The smell of it all is oppressive - decay and rot 
attracting a great number of flies to feed and breed on the 
scattered pieces of physical humanity.

A longsword with diamond-shaped silver and a blowfly on the pommel is set there.~
   The blade of this sword looks to be well made and functionaly. 
However, by looking at the sword you can tell that most of the 
detail was put into the crossguard, hilt and pommel. By looking 
at the blade you can see where the hammer of the blacksmith 
struck the metal as it was formed. When looking at the 
crossguard it looks as if someone fairly skilled had made it. 
The crossguard forms a circle around the blade and has four round 
rods that come to a point equal distance around the edge of the 
circle. When looking at the hilt you can see that the cylinder 
shape bares diamond shaped silver wrapped with leather. The 
pommel, in an egglike shape has two flat sides and on each side a 
blowfly extrudes from the surface.

lightly tooled with elegant scrollwork along the borders. A pair

a polished, flame-engraved scimitar~
A polished, flame-engraved scimitar has been left upon the ground here.~
   This scimitar seems to have been crafted with a great deal of 
care and attention, its iron blade razor sharp and free of any 
dents or nicks it could have acquired during the crafting 
process, polished to a high sheen. The weapon has a mild curve 
near the tip and sports a deep fuller running for nearly three 
quarters of its total length, adding more strength to its blade. 
Its crossguard has one side curling downwards to protect its 
wielder's hand and is made of bronze, securely held in place by 
the hilt which is carved from birch wood and wrapped in blood red 
leather, ensuring a tight grip even during the heat of battle. 
Capped off by a simple bronze pommel this weapon appears to have 
been made for function, it is very well balanced and seems more 
than suitable for the rigors of combat, a tool of death when held 
by capable hands. It appears its maker left his mark on this 
weapon, an inch above the crossguard both sides of the blade are 
graced with a small image of a flame.

A $finecolor swirled glass pitcher stands upon its base here.~
   Brilliant, $finecolor swirls purposefully across the pale 
green tint of this glass pitcher, creating a delicate pattern. 
The base is sturdy and bowls upwards tapering in before flaring 
out to form a lip with a rounded point perfect for pouring. 
Halfway up the side of the pitcher, opposite from the lip, is a 
glass handle. The pitcher is made all from one piece of glass, 
with no seams or breaks in its smoothness.

A dead cat lies here, rancid and soft.~
   This cat is dead and starting to smell, with tattered ears and 
a crooked tail. Though emaciated when living, due to the nature 
of its current decomposition it has started to bloat, giving it 
an unusually well-fed, healthy appearance, if not for the filmy 
white, gunked over eyes. This corpse has yet to stiffen and 
seems quite pliable, as if its back and several other vitally 
important bones had been crushed, enabling this cat to be molded 
into unusual positions and different sorts of attire.

a dark-iron longsword with a bronze guard~
A longsword of dark-iron lies here, its guard of burnished bronze.~
   This longsword has been expertly crafted by a master of the 
trade and this is reflected in its deadly-earnest lethality. Its 
blade has been forged of folded, dark iron honed to a razor's 
edge and tempered to further increase its strength and 
reliability in battle, as well its killing potential. The dark 
iron, a smoky black in colour, leads into a beautifully worked 
guard and hilt of burnished bronze, rather simple in make; the 
guard is a straight, rectangular piece of bronze and the hilt has 
been wrapped in supple, white-dyed leather. The pommel, however, 
is composed entirely of a rounded opal: the gem black, flecked 
faintly red and orange, and attached to the rest of the hilt with 
bronze wire.

which has been rivetted thin strips of iron and from which drapes 
longer strips of soft, pliable leather. These strips, which hang 
to the knees of the wearer, are also plated by squares of iron, 
polished to a metallic sheen, and do to protect the groin and 
upper thighs of the user.

scythe midnight-hued fluted-edge Widowmaker UNIQUEpEndrek METAL~
a midnight-hued scythe with a fluted edge~
A midnight-hued scythe with a fluted edge has been set here.~
   From the tightly wrapped leather that encases the shaft to the 
blade itself; this weapon remains a uniform color of pitch black; 
save only for the silvery-blue sheen of the weapon's long edges 
which ripple like waves on the surface of a winter lake. As 
deadly as it is fast, the killing blades of this scythe-shaped 
weapon are three fold. A tapering psuedo-shortsword jutting from 
the very top of the shaft for the use in the first blood and coup 
de grace, a viciously curved back spike for the return swing, and 
a peculiar main blade that resembles a scythe blade in no way; 
instead looking like it should belong on a hilt of it's own. 
It's form that of a massive, double-edged broadsword that had 
been fashioned into a gentle curve turning inward towards the 
shaft. While on its own formidable enough. The mastermind 
behind this weapon has reduced the weight of the blade and 
increased the savageness of the wounds dealt by serrating the 
edges with a fluted design. Each dip extending inward on the 
blade in a simplistic alternating pattern from one side of the 
weapon to the other. Flawlessly engraved into the main blade in 
Black Speech sigils, reads: "Widow Maker".

cloak lion-hide bristly-maned UNIQUEpEndrek LEATHER~
a bristly-maned, lion-hide cloak~
A bristly-maned cloak of lion skin lies here.~
   Fashioned from the skin of a single, massive male lion, this 
cloak is a rich bronze and orange in color; broken in places by 
slashes of missing fur shown where old battle scars had once 
adorned the mighty beast. The skin seems to have been left 
entirely intact. From scalp down to tail and paws, painstakingly 
removed before fashioned for use as a garment. While seeming to 
be entirely for decoration, the insides of it have been stitched 
with a quilted, plush lining for keeping the wearer warm. 
Adorning the neck of this cloak is the majestic mane of the 
creature. A golden bronze hue that rests around the shoulder in 
a thick, furry scruff; the animal's scalp stitched back on as a 
sort of hood that can be pulled up over the head and brought down 
over the face as a sort of lion mask. The maker has gone so far 
as to reattach the hand-sized fangs to the inside of the jowls. 
It is kept on the wearer's back by a pair of cleverly hidden jade 
clasps in the lion's forward knees.

A-line cut to just above the ankles. Brilliant gold buttons 
fasten along the chest. Embroidery similar to that about the 
neck frames the row of buttons, gradually changing as it loops 
near the right breast, forming a coiling cobra in distinct detail 
with a mix of both gold and black needlework.

it drapes over the shoulders and to the wearer's arms, falling 
just past the wrists. With a subtle v-shaped neckline, the

revealing the details of a coiling cobra worked around the lower 
hem and neckline.

a black, silk sash bearing a gold cobra~
A black, silk sash lies in a heap here, bearing gold embroidery.~
   This sash is formed of heavy silk and has been dyed a perfect 
black. Roughly the thickness of a man's hand, it is long enough 
to wrap about the waist many times. Most prominent is the gold 
embroidery worked into the luxurious fabric, laying in stunning 
contrast against the black. The figure of a cobra spreads across 
the garment, its head poised to strike at the end.

a vicious, wyrm-shaped axe~
A vicious, wyrm-shaped axe has been set here.~
   Its metal blued a rich blue, the head of this vicious axe has 
been forged with extreme detail to depict a ferocious black wyrm, 
positioned as if perched atop the darkened hardwood shaft of the 
weapon. Its long tail curls downwards around the handle ending 
in a wicked point, secured by several rivets. Further upwards 
two thickly muscled legs and arms extend from its body, ending in 
vicious claws and although sleek, its body appears to be well 
muscled, covered all over in scales with jags and hooks 
protruding from its back. The beast's head appears eerily 
lifelike, its feral catlike eyes fixed downwards and maw opened 
wide in a mute roar, a small tongue protruding and rows of sharp 
teeth visible. Its edge razor sharp, the bearded blade of the 
axe has been worked to flow naturally from its back and serves as 
its batlike wings, several ridges hammered into the blade 
together with a shallow fuller to appear as the bones. Upon 
closer inspection one would find the smith has left its mark, a 
small flame hammered on the wide bottom of the blade. The handle 
has been wrapped in a dull black leather, secured with rivets and 
although aesthetically very pleasing, this weapon is of stout 
make, more than capable of killing or severely maiming those who 
oppose its wielder.

an elaborately embellished, lily white velvet skirt~
A pool of lily white velvet lies here, elaborate embellishing visible.~
   Sitting low on the hips, this skirt does its best to flatter 
and display the lower curves of the feminine form, while also 
allowing the freest movement of the hips and stomach as though 
designed with the southron dancer in mind. Gathering subtly only 
at the back by a short series of lacing, the silhouette of the 
skirt follows the rounding of the hips before flaring out 
dramatically with the help of several gored panels. Two inches 
of the hem have been heavily embroidered with the startling 
contrast of ebon black upon the lily white velvet, portraying 
airy whirls among a motif of jasmine flowers and curling leaves. 
A single row of silvery bells hang from the hem, giving off a 
pleasant musical jingle with every movement.

An embroidered, asymmetrical lily white silk choli is left here.~
   Made from medium-weight silk, this choli covers only one 
shoulder and arm, with the sleeve covering three quarters of the 
arm, leaving the left shoulder and midriff completely bared. The 
entirety of the garment follows and supports the curves of the 
wearer in a snug, tailored fit. The back is still brazenly 
revealing, as the coverage, like the front, is also asymmetrical 
and connects by a secure button along the side. Velvet ribbon of 
ebon black embellishes the slopping neckline, the lower hemline, 
and the cuff of the sleeve, marking a contrast against lily white 
silk. White scrollwork embroidery has been worked over the 
entirety of the piece, more elaborately against the black, 
occasionally accented by beaded blossoms.

   A long rectangle of fabric, this veil is made of two yards of 
seamless velvet. Dyed a pristine shade of lily white, its purity 
is marred by elaborate embroidery of scrolling vines in ebon 
black, marked at intervals by delicate, artistic blossoms. Each 
leaf and flower is accentuated by tiny glass beads, causing it to 
gleam in any light source available. Further accentuating the 
hem, a thin border of black needlework follows the uneven lines 
of scrolling vines with deliberate imperfection.

a massive, skull-shaped morningstar~
A skull-shaped morningstar lays here, chain coiled around hilt.~
   Undoubtedly fashioned by a master of the trade, this 
savage-looking weapon is an exhibit in practicality and 
viciousness. The head of this blunt weapon has been carefully 
shaped into that of a malevolent skull, that to the trained eye, 
appears to be orkish. The dusky hue of the weapon is broken in 
places, such as the tops of the teeth and around the eye-sockets 
and nose-slits, revealing the bright, silvery-blue steel of its 
make. While in its own right capable of great damage if swung, 
it also has forged along its cranium narrow, curving blades and 
vicious flanges honed to a razor's edge, set at regular intervals 
to form a spiked halo. Attached to this head is a heavy-duty 
chain of chunky black steel which in turn is attached to a shaft 
long enough to be comfortably gripped by two hands. The shaft in 
question has been wrapped twice in thick, black leather before 
being riveted into place with numerous burnished, bronze studs.

An intricately-scarred man, a dog head sewn on his neck, stands in a corner.~
   A flowing network of cruel scars mar the figure of this young 
man, running down his chest, arms and back. Despite these 
inflicted imperfections adorning his burnished bronze frame; his 
build is powerful, though there is a stiffness to the muscles of 
his body that seems to suggest something lifeless about him now. 
In fact, much of this man's musculature looks forced and 
contrived, as if sculpted by an artist who had only basic 
knowledge of human anatomy in the first place; though there are 
exacting details, much of it is guesswork. The most unusual 
thing about this young man, however, seems to be his head - or 
what now suffices for his head. His own seems to have, by the 
jagged stitches at his neck, hastily removed. In its place a 
dog's head has been sewn, with a ragged ear and blue marbles for 
eyes.

sharpened to a fine edge. The tip of the sword, though still 
sharp, is rounded and its hilt is of dark, solid bronze; the same 
as its blade. The grip has been wrapped in thick, sweat-stained 
leather. Two wide squares of bronze extend out from both sides 
of the hilt, acting as the crossguard, and seem to have been 
designed for easier parrying.

   A bowl of solid bronze about an inch thick comprises much of 
this piece of head gear. It is lined within by soft dingy fur, 
to both pad and protect the skull, and seems of sturdy enough 
construction, though certainly by no means gaudy. The bronze 
skullcap itself fails to protect the ears of its wearer, as its 
rim ends above them, but to make up for this thick leather flaps, 
sewn roughly into a box shape, extend down from the ears to the 
jawline and neck. Bronze studs have been set at regular 
intervals along the rim of this dome for added protection.

inches long and coming to a well-sharpened point, triangular in

capable of puncturing deep into most armors.

   This misty weapon was once constructed of dull iron forged 
into a heavy five foot long pole and then wrapped in black 
leather. At the end of the pole is a pair of crescent shaped 
blades coming to a sharp point in the middle. Resembling a twin 
headed glaive slightly a pair of a tassels are tied to where the 
head meets the haft. This weapon could likely function as a 
spear or a pole-arm and still function in a lethal fashion in 
either capacity. Its form is ethereal and wavy.

a large fang encircled by an engraved metal band~
A large fang encircled by an engraved metal band lies here.~
   A truly exotic piece of equipment, this large fang appears to 
once have belonged to a massive spider, its recovery a hazardous 
one as the beast was undoubtedly reluctant to part with it. Its 
tapering end has been sawed off neatly and the inside is covered 
with oily fur, applying some of it upon whatever is sheathed. 
Its clearly designed to hold a weapon shaft although a sword 
would fit, its blade would be bare. The whole piece is sanded 
down to ensure a good fit for the tempered iron band, latter 
polished to a high sheen and fastened around it with rivets and 
covering nearly two thirds of the fang. Engraved on the metal 
band in a scrolling fashion is a highly detailed scene of battle, 
a muscular, large busted female ork slaying a near horse-sized 
spider. Her form is bereft of any attire save for a pair of 
scale leggings and a band around her arm showing a rough cage, 
she holds a large axe in both hands, aimed to hack away at the 
arachnid. The latter has one of its hairy legs raised, as if to 
jab at the amazone warrior. Protruding from one side of the band 
is a flattened ring, allowing it to be hooked to a strap and worn 
in a number of ways. Set besides it are two small signs, showing 
a small flame and a broken shackle, undoubtly marks of its 
makers.

brand GOOD_QUALITY keen blackened iron sharp METAL~
a keen, blackened iron brand~
A sharp, black blade lies here.~
   Comprised of blackened iron, the blade of this finely crafted 
short sword sports a sharp finish on both sides. The blade 
extends from it's hilt about two feet before it tapers off into 
an equally sharp point. Running three quarters of the blade is a 
narrow fuller, minimizing weight and reinforcing the edge. Just 
above the crossguard the image of a wide eyed goblin has been 
engraved in a sketching manner, wispy hair cut just above the 
ears and its face twisted in an eternal sneer, other side of the 
blade showing a small image of a flame. The crossguard has its 
ends flattened and tapers towards the blade, protecting the hand. 
Further down the handle is wrapped in supple, red leather, in a 
meticulous fashion, ensuring a firm grip. At the end of the 
handle is a bronze pommel in the shape of a lidless eye and 
although this pommel appears is aesteticly pleasing, it could 
amply serve as a counterweight for the blade. Of sturdy make, 
well balanced and sharpened finely, when handled properly this 
light blade easily ensures horrific wounds with savage 
efficiency.

   This crescent shaped blade is dark as midnight, apparently 
made of an unusual alloy or metal. For a scimitar, it is both 
longer and thinner than most are. The matte surface reveals no 
reflections and seems to be surprisingly sharp. Above the hilt a 
richly ornamented hawk is engraved which spreads it wings as if 
descending on a prey. Thick black leather straps is tied around 
the hilt, ensuring a good grip. The silvery-white pommel is 
shaped like an eight-pointed star with a slight cavity in the 
centre.

sheathing whatever it covers in a softly moving shadow. The cowl 
is large and deep, its voluminous hood seeming to poise over the 
head as its ebon folds keep swathed in an abyssal veil all that 
lies within. Skillfully embroidered in meticulous detail, a grey 
gravestone covers the left breast of the wool fabric; even the 
likeness of writing can be seen on the stone. While along the 
lower hem and on the edge of the cowl, a thin, subtle rope of 
grey needlework adds to the design of the garment.

a pair of split-toed boots with padded soles~
A pair of leather, split-toed boots with padded soles lie here.~
   These well-crafted boots have been manufactured from a tough, 
supple leather. They hold a deep, earthen brown color and are 
exceptionally light. Thin, strong laces of sinew weave up 
through blackened, iron rings from near the tip of the boot's toe 
to their top, providing a sure, snug fit. They raise up to the 
mid-calf of the wearer. The toe of the boot has been split to 
allow the big and second toes to move independently of the other 
three, increasing mobility and the wearer's ability to feel the 
ground. The soles have also been padded skillfully at the balls 
and heels of the feet effectively dampening the footfalls of the 
wearer.

a skull-shaped prayer totem of black basalt~
A small skull of black stone has been left here, strung on a leather cord.~
   Dark, igneous rock has been chipped into the rough shape of a 
skull, leaving little detail save for shallow eye-sockets and a 
row of straight indentations that indicate the teeth. The totem 
is approximately the size of a hen's egg, fitting nicely into the 
palm of a human hand, and a hole has been drilled vertically 
through the stone, allowing it to be hung on a thong and worn. 
The somewhat uneven surface of the dense basalt rock is rough to 
the touch, but the skull itself is sufficiently symmetrical and 
unmarred.

A bronze-hilted, razor sharp longsword is laid carefully here.~
   A razor sharp blade forged of steel extends from a dark, 
styled bronze hilt, the edges of which curl upward forming 
abstract looking quillons, one of which slightly longer then it's 
opposite curving up and remaining flat to catch an oposing blade; 
it's sister quillon is left shorter then usual and ending in a 
thin, vicous point flanking the base of the blade. The blade 
itself, is about four inches wide at it's bottom but tapers as it 
ends in a sharp point, reaching about four feet in total length 
it also sports a gentle darkened look to it. The hilt has been 
bound tightly in a single, dark red strip of leather. The hilt 
is also gently tapped about, giving a sort of simple twisting 
look to it. The pommel, has been beaten down to a slimmer shape 
and lightly pointed with several small strips of dark red leather 
hanging loosely about it.

A finely-tailored blood-red surcoat is here, folded neatly.~
   Very fine, light-weight linen was used for this article which 
holds a blood-red tint. It has been well-pressed, giving it a 
crisp look. When worn by a taller person, it is a snug fitting 
coat that would extend to a little past the knees, with a collar 
rising half-way up the wearer's neck. The cut is such that it 
closely hugs the wearer's frame, almost impeding mobility. It 
buttons up on the left breast, where a shiny row of gold buttons 
are stitched into the linen. A single slit runs down the front 
from just below the waist so as to allow greater leg movement. 
The final touch of embellishment is metallic gold thread stitched 
into the linen, a refined floral pattern of curling vines crowned 
with floral pattern of curling vines crowned with flowers and 
thorns, which nicely compliments the coat's deep red hue.

of a thick hardwood shaft easily the length of a man, completely 
wrapped in leather. A braided loop is fastened to the butt end 
and several iron rings balance the weapon. Attached securely on 
the other end is the steel hammer head of the weapon, shaped in a 
tear drop shape and decorated with barbaric runes hinting of foul 
witchcraft. Two noticeable icons have been set amongst the 
runes, depicting a flame and a cage. Protruding from the round 
side of the head are three spikes no longer than an inch, 
obviously designed to pierce armor before the monstrous head 
comes crashing in. Its weight would suggest various kinds of 
metal used in its making and although obviously of yrkin make, 
the quality and balance would indicate the work of a master.

along the underbelly and the back of this piece, winding over the 
entirety. The underbelly has been given a light coating of wood 
stain while the back has had it applied more heavily to darken 
the wood. One noticeable part to this piece is darkly stained 
eyes; a smoothed circular ball of wood sits on either side of the 
angular head.

inch of stone is smooth and polished, adding a light glean to its 
visage.

a bevel-edged, steel scimitar~
A steel scimitar engraved with a snake and boar tusk lies here.~
   Wrought of high quality steel and tempered to better resist 
the rigors of combat, this scimitar is a mixture of aesthetics 
and functionality. An elegant curve in its blade lends it a 
graceful appearance yet its razor sharp, bevel edge indicates 
this is no weapon of ceremony. Clearly visible upon the blade is 
the image of a snake coiling around a boar's tusk, the other side 
graced with a roaring flame, both engraved with great care for 
detail. The hilt has been wrapped in green tinted leather, 
secured with rivets set in a swirling fashion and capped off by a 
bronze pommel. Its balance and craftsmanship are excellent, 
hinting at the work of a master.

A fierce raven attached to a chain necklace, steel surface glinting dully.~
   Fitting snugly in the palm of ones hand, this metal piece 
depicts a fierce looking raven, shaped with great care to detail. 
Its wings spread out and claw like talons appearing ready to tear 
flesh from bone, feral eyes cast downwards upon its unfortunate 
prey. Attached to a necklace of metal rings with a hook at one 
end to secure it, both the chain and raven itself have been 
forged from tempered steel, cold to the touch. A mark has been 
engraved on the back, depicting a roaring flame.

cloak mantle dense warg-hide UNIQUE_pSnaah LEATHER~
a dense, warg-hide mantle~
A dense, warg-hide mantle lies here.~
   Dense, unyielding fur is sewn together thickly to form this 
weighty, yet protective mantle. Pitch-black in coloring the fur 
is obviously attributed to that of a warg, bristly and harsh to 
the touch, far from comfortable to the skin. Throughout this 
piece are hundreds of tiny fangs, riveted through the dense hides 
to offer additional protection to the wearer, and are sparsely 
visible beneath the fur. Most of the bulk of this piece is held 
about the shoulder, which would be bunch of to ear height upon 
the wearer protecting the sides and back of the head, as well as 
the shoulder line. Additionally the heavy-studded pelt falls 
down the backside of the wearer to the waist, where it has been 
hastily cropped, and crudely painted with a skull in off-white 
paint. Securing this large piece to the wearer is the section of 
the pelt which came from the warg's legs, paws still in-tact with 
their claws. Overall this piece is of sturdy design and yields 
an obvious stench, while many fleas also call this gruesome, if 
functional, mantle home.

falchion iron dusky saw-backed pNikoloxUNIQUEx METAL~
a dusky, saw-backed iron falchion~
A dusky iron falchion lies here, serrated waves running jagged down one side.~
   This falchion has been masterfully crafted of thick, dusky 
black iron and fitted with a rather plain, utilitarian handle. 
The simple handle is wrapped in a blackly-dyed leather, leading 
down to a skull-shaped pommel. The broad blade rounds into a 
keen, single razor-edged side, like a cleaver, while the other 
side of the blade juts out slightly at spaced intervals to form 
jagged waves - aesthetically pleasing, as well as lending further 
weight to its strikes. Along the blade itself, where one might 
expect the usual nicks and scars of battle-tried gear, two 
snake-like sea creatures have been engraved - their etching 
bright and lacking the dusky darkness of the iron - and entwine 
their way up the metal to meet at the top. They face each other 
in an unending stare, their mouths agape with fangs bared and 
fork tongues flickering.

a spiked maille, red-tinted orcish steel gorget~
A maille-draped plate gorget lays here, covered in spikes.~
   This piece of armor is quite distinctly Orkish in design. It 
is extensive in design beyond what any normal armor smith would 
attempt, with plate upon plate and many engravings, of skulls, 
teeth, claws, axes, and other less legible things. Crude, 
elongated spiked jut from the circumference of this gorget, 
circling its width. The gorget is compromised of steel plates 
covering blood red tinted maille, which is comprised of numerous 
small rings which are carefully interlocked. It all comes 
together in one piece, and is fitted to loosely come over the 
neck, spilling onto the armoring below. At some angles, with the 
right light, the gorget looks as red as blood in the moonlight, 
and is truly fearsome to behold.

a heavy, orkish maille gorget spiked with fangs~
A heavy maille gorget lies here, spiked with fangs.~
   Thick, fire-darkened maille forms the circumference of this 
gorget which is purely functional in arrangement. The rings of 
this gorget are hundreds in the numbering, most tightly locked 
with four or less adjacent rings to form a tightly bonded weave. 
There are some gaps in the rings which have become riveted and 
reinforced with a series of scales in a makeshift attempt at 
patching the piece. To further deflect blows upon the piece a 
series of fangs are settled upon a strip of leather which travels 
across the gorget, and alternatively serves as a buckle to 
sizing. Many of the rings have become rusted overtime, either 
due to exposure of the elements or lack of care.

outward to the forearm are a pair of metal plates, lazily 
hammered to resemble skulls, gaps of the teeth, nose, and eye 
sockets additionally darkened to show off the work. Serving as 
additional protection, and a crude form of sizing, these sleeves 
are circled by a series of leather strips which are both 
spike-studded, and buckled. Many of the rings have become rusted 
overtime, either due to exposure of the elements, or lack of 
care.

   This breastplate was made by a master armorer-- it is the very 
definition of protection and comfort. Two blackened iron plates 
are forged to wrap snugly around the back, chest, and stomach, 
and are connected by a series of leather straps and bronze 
buckles, and padded on the inside with leather. Riveted on each 
shoulder of the breastplate sits a well-made pauldron of steel, 
articulated and polished. Upon the side of each pauldron, a jet 
black spider creature has been emblazoned in a shallow engraving 
filled with black paint.

a finely-made segmented cuirass with spiked pauldrons~
A segmented cuirass with spiked pauldrons lies on the ground here.~
   This breastplate consists of several black-iron bands made to 
wrap around the torso. Each one is held together by either a 
hinge or a buckle. The largest band is the top one-- it consists 
of two pieces made to fit comfortably around an adult orkish 
torso, the arm and neck holes allowing ample room for movement. 
From there the bands start down, each band attached expertly to 
the one above it, making the several pieces flow as one. The 
pauldrons are five connected segments, the largest closest to the 
neck, and each consecutive piece getting smaller. These bands 
are covered in small sharp spikes, giving the entire cuirass of 
black iron a macabre appearance.

   Various degrees of padding have been skillfully sewn into the 
layered cloth of this tunic with thin, blackened steel chain. 
This effectively adds to the armor's durability without hampering 
movement. The interwoven chain criss-crosses over the whole of 
the piece akin to a system of dark veins. The padding varies 
immensely in shape and density. In some places it is shallow and 
scant while in others it bulges out in cancer-like growths. This 
design creates an uneven edge that assists in breaking up the 
humanoid silhouette of the wearer. The dirty cloth, having been 
dyed different shades of blended grey, provides ideal camouflage 
for low light or rocky environments. It carries the musk of dirt 
and mildew.

About as long as a snaga is tall, it was designed to keep an

a crude, heavy-bladed orkish falchion with a broad tip~
A heavy-bladed falchion lies on the ground.~
   Crafted of dark iron, this falchion is crude-looking but 
effective, a hallmark of orkish craftsmanship. The blade is 
thick and heavy, roughly three foot in length and widening toward 
the tip where it cuts off at an ankle rather than a traditional 
curve, denoting this sword as a hacking weapon rather than 
slicing. A square, unadorned bronze crossguard protects the hand 
and the hide-wrapped hilt is oval in shape, ending in a fat 
pommel that gives the weighty falchion balance. The cutting edge 
is adequately sharp, but the sheer bulk and weight of the blade 
provides the majority of its danger, making it a fierce weapon 
for close-quarter chopping.

edges from the down the inside of the vest and along the 
shoulders. The vest sports a stiff broad collar which has been 
decorated most of all along the hem with golden stitching, dyed 
trim and styled, black embroidery. Dusky black buttons trail 
down one side, the mix of black set with gold trim giving a bold 
vibrant contrast.

hard, but flexible enough to provide a good walking surface while 
each calf-high boot supports the ankle firmly. Cords of leather 
lace the boots to the foot at the front, looped through ringed 
holes all the way up to the cuff.

   This dagger is a cruel testimony to orkish weaponry, the iron 
blade jagged and fierce with a barbed tip. A minimal crossguard 
barely protects the hand, and the hilt is quite thick for a 
weapon of its size, wound with undyed leather for a steady grip.. 
While the blade itself is enough to inflict horrendous wounds, 
the pommel of the dagger has been equipped with a long spike as 
well, allowing this weapon a further range of utility and 
attacks. The blade and spike are kept sharp, but both are 
heavily scratched and nicked.

a row of tree-stumps connected by a length of rusting chain~
A row of tree-stumps connected by a length of rusting chain is here.~
   A dozen uprooted tree-stumps have been chopped into rough 
blocks, flat at either end to rest evenly on a floor while 
providing a somewhat comfortable seat. A hole has been drilled 
through each stump and a long length of thick, rusting iron chain 
has been strung through them like some oversized necklace, 
keeping the dozen seats gathered while allowing them to be spaced 
about a campfire or table. Each stump is dirty and stained from 
such use.

A $finecolor leather scroll case lies here.~
   This leather scroll case has been well made of leather, formed 
to a cylinderical shape and boiled after first being dyed a 
$finecolor in colour. At one end a thick piece of corking, 
covered topwise by a thin layer of hard leather, serves as a 
stopper. A supple leather strap allows this case to be worn 
across the shoulders or back, much like a quiver, and is looks 
adjustable.

A circular wooden table is suspended around a stalagmite here.~
   A thick, circular board of wood has been fitted around a 
stalagmite, the stone spike protruding through a hole in the 
middle. Four chains are hammered to the edges of the board and 
attached again to the tip of the stalagmite, keeping the table 
suspended from the rock rather than standing on legs. The 
surface is nicked, scratched, stained and sullied in every 
imaginable way, but sturdy and certainly immovable.

A formidable throne hewn out of a broken stalagmite looms here.~
   A stalagmite as thick as an oak tree has been broken off five 
feet from the ground and hewn into a great seat, large enough to 
encompass a person if immense size. The seating surface is 
relatively smooth, sloping up into broad armrests while the back 
is simply a flattened indentation into the rest of the 
stalagmite. The outside of this crude furniture is left uneven 
and craggy, giving the impression that the huge throne has grown 
straight out of the cave floor.

 a rough, rounded pine cradle~
A roughly cut, rounded pine cradle stands here~
   This spacious, sturdy cradle is fashioned from good-quality 
pine wood, shaped with a rounded frame. The short sides are 
raised higher then the long side. On what would would be the 
foot-end of the cradle there's the carved image of a burning 
Cage, carefully engraved into the wood and painted red. The 
higher part, most likely the head-end, has a strange being carved 
into it. An etheral being with long limps and a stretched out 
face. The ghost is well carved and shaped in an orkishly crude 
fashion. The inside of the cradle, where the baby would rest, is 
extremely smooth and many hours must have been spent making it 
so, however the rest of the cradle is roughly cut. The cradle's 
short legs are fixed to two horizontal bars, each curving 
slightly to make it possible to rock the cradle if desired.

   A hilt of some silvery-alloy has been covered in black leather 
adorned with silver to create a shape of two half moons melded 
together. Silver intricate designs of a fiery sun over seemingly 
endless dunes rung along the hilt; sewn into the black leather 
with perfect precision. The watery steel of this blade is 
light-weight and thin, although it is thick in length the long 
knives blade curves into a sharp point the edge is honed to a 
dangerously sharp edge. Crafted with the utmost care and finest 
materials this weapon is a sight to behold.

an impressively-crafted, blackened spear with silver accents is set here.~
   Measuring roughly four feet in length from base to tip, this 
spear proudly showcases superb craftsmanship. Tempered steel as 
been carefully blackened to display a uniform finish. Etched 
into the surface of the shaft, flames swirl up towards the point 
of the weapon. Copper enamel has been carefully painted into the 
pattern to provide a constrast against the darker metal. The 
fiery design breaks near the middle to make way for an engraved 
falcon. Though the body is but an etching, its wings are adorned 
with copper, each feather shaped both for look and utility, to 
provide a grip for the wielder. The shaft's theme persists to 
the head of the spear. A polished, steel falcon's head forms the 
jointing that fits the blade to the handle and finely detailed 
wings arch around it to form a point.

   Made of solid, dully-gleaming bronze, this armband has been 
carefully etched to look like that of a sea serpent. Its long, 
paintbrush-shaped tail curls in a slight loop at the end of this 
menacing creature. Clearly defined scales have been expertly 
notched along its slowly curving body, showing in sharp contrast 
to the finely detailed waves that weave over the lower body of 
the creature as if it were still part of the ocean. Coming to 
the head, sharp horns sprout from the metal scales, curving 
backwards like hooks. The pattern gives them the look of stone 
or very sharp bone. Out of the side of its head, one bright 
gleaming amethyst eye stares out with a fierce, unblinking gaze.

   This mercenary soldier hangs about the northern gate. His 
face is roughly stubbled and his armor nicked in places, showing 
signs of wear and tear though (aside from a few missing iron 
scales and hastily patched holes in his vest's leather backing) 
also signs of painstaking care. His thumb has been hooked into 
his belt, riding low by a swordhilt at his hip, and he wears the 
mark of his organization with, if not exactly pride, a certain 
casuality. He looks bored; perhaps if you were to #6summon

offer a great deal of protection to the wearer's vulnerable heart 
and shoulderline, this unusual style of armor is clearly unique. 
While composed almost entirely of thick leather that covers the 
majority of the chest, and abdomen, it has been reinforced with a 
series of bronze rivets that run across the belly and back of the 
piece. The leather is dyed a $finecolor in color, and it has a 
light grey lining of fur, inconspicuously concealed beneath the 
hardened leather shell.

A black warsword with a wolf head pommel and a bronze, horned crossguard lies here.~
   This heavy, five feet long warsword sports a thoroughly 
blackened blade, its edge surprisingly sharp and its lower half 
viciously serrated. The shoulder of the blade is left dulled, 
engraved upon it are the faces of a girl and two boys, features 
twisted in an eternal scream, the other side shows a roaring 
flame. Set just below is the horned crossguard wrought of 
bronze, curling slightly towards the blade, wicked spikes 
protruding from it. The bronze pommel not only serves as counter 
weight but is artfully shaped to resemble a wolves head, snarling 
angrily. The materials used are of high quality and the weapon 
feels solid and well balanced in ones hands.

A circular rope adorned with meathook-impaled heads lays abandoned here.~
   Braided hemp rope cords its way through the eyes of five 
meathooks, tied off on either side of the eye, and knotted at the 
end to produce a loop. Adorning the grisly display of yrcish 
decoration are a series of disembodied heads which have been 
impaled at the peak of the skull, and have the meat hook rammed 
through the interior of their skulls so that its point is 
directed outward from the mouth. The faces of the decapitated 
heads are directed away from the wearer. Probably Gondorian in 
descent, rotting flesh still clings to some of the lesser decayed 
heads. There seems to be no preference in gender upon this 
piece, some heads descending of males, while others obviously 
female. Hair which remains varies in color, all braided neatly 
to allow for as little interference as possible. The eyes of the 
further decayed heads have been replaced with blue-tinted bed 
stones, which have been pounded by mallet into the eyesocket, 
creating some cracking upon the skulls. Those which have 
retained their eyes seem to have one thing in common, they are 
all bright blue to a piercing degree.

a broad, dark-iron orkish scimitar~
A broad-bladed scimitar of dark iron has been left here.~
   Forged of quality iron, this scimitar is short and broad, 
nicely balanced for powerful cutting strokes. The weapon denotes 
the hallmark properties of a skilled orkish smith, done without 
regard for apperance but with excellent craftsmanship. The blade 
is unadorned and darkened in the forging process, appearing dull 
black; fairly thick and sturdy, it is cast with a fuller to 
lighten it, and its single outer edge is honed to great 
sharpness. The curve is moderate and the first half of the blade 
is straight, widening only slightly toward the center of balance. 
A thick and wide bronze cross-guard with upward-swept quillons 
gives good protection for the hand, and a fat, disk-shaped pommel 
of the same alloy provides counter-balance to the formidable 
weapon. Plain leather cord is wound snugly around the wooden 
hilt, granting a secure grip.

A stiff pile of $finecolor cloth lies here.~
   Tailored from sturdy, double-layered $finecolor cloth, the 
stiff cut of these pants lend a certain ambiguity to the shape

lend note to the stiffness of the cut, and a set of leather laces 
wind up the left hip.

A pair of supple, $finecolor silk and linen pants lies here.~
   Cut masterfully from a blend of $finecolor linen and silk, the 
former of the two makes up the first layer of these supple, 
formally cut pants. The durable linen is of high quality and 
visible only upon the waist and at the cuffs, whilst the fine 
silk that wraps the flows gently over it. Delicate, paired seams 
run up the outside of the legs, and the fabric of the cuff and 
the waist is of a faintly brighter hue than that of the rest of 
the garment.

A pair of tooled, $finecolor leather boots rest here.~
   Cut and formed of ornate, tooled leather, these $finecolor 
boots have been shaped to rise to mid-calf. Bearing a design of 
tiered leather upon the instep and over the toe, which bears a 
rounded tip, they have obviously been stitched and crafted by a 
master's hand. The soles are of thick leather, with slightly 
raised heels, and leather laces loop their way up the fronts, 
each capped with a leather strap and steel buckle.

adorned with a series of high-quality rubies, mounted at equal

each gem before sloping back inwards to tangle together in a 
serpentine twist.

a stout, ram head mace~
A stout mace lies here, steel head shaped into a ram's head.~
   Forged out of tempered steel, the head of this mace has been 
painstakingly worked to depict the head of a ram. Its ridged 
horns curled and reaching all the way to the back of the head, 
protruding above its brows which are pitted in a frown. Feral, 
lifeless eyes and stubby snout with a goatee complete the image. 
An engravement of a flame is visible on the back of its neck, 
size of a thumbs nail. The head is firmly attached to a hardwood 
shaft which is wrapped with black leather cording for a better 
grip. The butt end has three bronze bands balancing the weapon, 
a swirling pattern covering each one and a flat hook allows it to 
be secured. The weapon has a solid feel to it, appearing capable 
of delivering devastating blows.

An embroidered, crimson aba of fine linen is folded here.~
   Draping the wearer from neck to ankle, this loose-fitting aba 
is made of crimson, fine linen, its weave of lustrously smooth 
threads. With a deep hood that can protect the wearer's face 
from the elements, the cloth flows in a regal manner about the 
ankles, billowing out in generous folds when the wearer walks. 
Most notable is a meticulously worked emblem on the back, 
embroidered to give realistic detail to the black silhouette of a 
heater shield, crossed by smithing hammers in full color.

A greenish leather sheath lies here, its top adorned with an engraved bronze casing.~
   Composed of a greenish leather, this wide sheath appears 
rather worn, small cracks and wrinkles lining its surface. The 
top is adorned with a bronze casing, lower part left free and 
pliable enough to bend to the shape of the blade. Still securely 
attached, one side of the case has been carefully engraved with a 
male humanoid, form clad in a metal armor lined with spikes. He 
wields a slender falchion, free hand raised with the palm up and 
a small flame protruding from it. His face shows prominent signs 
of orcish features, yet other traits would hint at his half blood 
lineage.

   Masterfully created this iron breastplate is the very 
definition of protection and comfort. Two blackened iron plates 
are forged to wrap snugly around the back, chest, and stomach, 
and are connected by a series of leather straps and bronze 
buckles, and padded on the inside with leather. Riveted on each 
shoulder of the breastplate sits a well-made pauldron of iron, 
articulated and polished. Upon the side of each pauldron, a jet 
black spider creature has been emblazoned in a shallow engraving 
filled with black paint.

a blackened trident with blade prongs~
A blackened trident with serrated blade prongs lies here.~
   Although simple in design, this black trident is obviously 
well suited for its task. Its steel head consists of three blade 
like prongs which are finely sharpened, their surface blackened 
during the forging process. The outer two prongs are a V-shape 
with a third protduring from the middle, all of them have one 
serrated edge. Wrapped partly with black cording, the length of 
the hardwood shaft would suggest it is to be wielded with a 
single hand, although there is enough room for both. It has a 
good balance to it and apart from a small flame etched on the 
base of the head, the weapon bears no further adornment.

that this piece was intended to represent a black widow.

A simple pool of river rocks is set here, filled with murky water.~
   This pool is surrounded by river rocks and has no source of 
renewal or warmth. The water is tainted with dirt and blood 
unless it has recently been replaced. It looks like it would 
serve as a rather dubious place for one to bathe.

a steel, clenched fist mace~
A steel mace with a head shaped alike a clenched fist is set here.~
   A rather ominous looking weapon of war, this steel mace has 
been worked with painstaking detail to depict a clenched fist. 
Its roughly the size of a man's hand, complete with fingers, 
knuckles and thin wrinkles. The thumb sports a thick, flat ring 
with an engraving of what appears to be a scalpel whilst closer 
inspection reveals a tiny roaring flame stamped upon one of the 
nails. Its balance is excellent, the hardwood shaft wrapped with 
leather and capped off with several strips of bronze.

a pair of orkish scalemail leggings~
A pair of orkish scalemail leggings lies here in a heap.~
   Comprised of fire-blackened scales, this crude but effective 
armor seems to have been made in the orkish mind set. The sturdy 
iron scales have been riveted onto thick leather backing and 
further reinforced with patchy fur underneath of the cracked 
leather to offer a separate level of comfort. Upon the backing, 
spiked nails have been punched through the leather and in between 
each scale to stand up a little more than an inch above the 
blackened iron. Aside from the patchy fur, signs of mis care of 
exposure to the elements becomes evident upon a closer 
examination. Spread out sporadically amiss the black scales 
stand some other rusty, grey iron scales that seem to have been 
quickly placed there during a repairing process. On each 
knee-cap region of the heavy leggings, rusting plates have been 
attached and hammered lazily into the shape of a skull. Despite 
the multiple signs of wear and tear, the craftsmanship and weight 
of the piece alone would be enough to amply supply the wearer a 
great degree of protection.

   Comprised of fire-blackened scales, this crude but effective 
armor seems to have been made In the orkish mind set. The sturdy 
iron scales have been riveted onto thick leather backing with a 
further padded with the patchy lining of some unfortunate 
creature?s hide. Over time and through use, the fur lining 
underneath of the leather has started to fall away, leaving only 
matted down strands of fur that has the smell of dried sweat and 
blood clinging to it. Further, upon the backing, sharp nails, 
about an inch and a half in length, have been punched through the 
leather and painstakingly between each scale to give the piece of 
armor a wicked appearance. Aside from scattered rusty nails and 
the patchy fur lining, signs of mis care for this armor becomes 
evident upon a closer examination. Spread out sporadically amiss 
the blackened scales stands some other rusty, grey iron scales 
that seem to have been quickly placed there through various 
repairs. On the elbow-region of the sleeves, rusting plates have 
been attached and hammered lazily into the shape of a skull. 
Despite the multiple signs of wear and tear, the craftsmanship 
and weight of the piece alone would be enough to amply supply the

A thick, orkish scalemail gorget lies here in a heap.~
   Comprised of fire-blackened scales, this crude but effective 
piece of armor seems to have been made in the orkish mind set. 
Sturdy iron scales have been riveted onto thick leather backing 
that has been further lined with patchy warg-fur to provide 
further comfort to the wearer. Upon the backing, short nails, 
about a inch in length, have been punched through the leather and 
painstakingly between each scale to give the piece of armor a 
twisted appearance. Aside from the few chipped nails and other 
noticeable nicks, it seems that a few scales have been replaced 
in the past due to quick, and fledgling repairs; rusted, iron 
scales contrasting easily from the other blackened lot. The 
gorget opens and closes on the side via two straps that flow into 
buckles and can be easily accessed to be tightened and loosened 
as the wearer pleases. While this gorget may certainly have it?s 
signs of mis care and abuse, it seems to still be able to amply 
supply the wearer a great degree of protection.

An artistic drawing of a woman has been placed here. ~
   Drawn in full colour and upon light watery blue parchment, 
this tawny-haired aqua-eyed woman lies naked upon a made bed. 
She lies with one hand tucked behind her head, with the other 
resting idly upon her stomach. She lies on her side, gazing out 
at you. Her lust-filled features curled in a naughty smile, bold 
reds bringing out the colour of her rosey lips and flushed 
cheeks, her eyes having been shaded a bright mix of blue and 
green, gaze out hopefully. Flowing down the front of her body, 
her hair falls, light browns, dark yellows and a few thin streaks 
of black bring out the tawny shade. It falls over her shoulders, 
down her front, partly covering her large bust, though not 
entirely. Further down, her hand lies, the nails upon both 
elegantly pointed and shaded red. Lying on her side, the womans 
legs lay close together, keeping her modest. Her skin coloured a 
mixture of soft pinks and light oranges to brings out her ample 
feminine curves. The contours of this petite womans body have 
been faintly outlined lightly in grey, which excentuates the 
womans curvy frame.

An elaborately-made, blackened breastplate bearing a flaring shoulder-guard lies here. ~
   Exotic and fierce in appearance, this breastplate has been 
painstakingly designed in an intricate manner. A sheet of 
blackened steel, wrought to the shape of the mans torso covers 
the chest and stomach; flaring out to add additional protection 
to the upper thigh. Dark leather straps connect the mailed back 
of the breastplate, providing some defence from blows received 
from behind. On the left shoulder, a wide, flaring steel 
shoulder-guard covers the left portion of the torso; tapering 
where the upper arm would be. The right shoulder is free, only 
bearing a series of overlapping, metal-lined leather paldrons, 
providing more movement for the right arm. The inside of the 
breastplate has been lined with supple leather for comfort. 
Serpentine creatures are engraved into the broad shoulder-guard, 
snaking along the flaring rim. On the chestplate, a silver moon 
has been etched over the wearer's heart.

a raw, thick, mottled warg pelt~
A raw, thick warg pelt lies here, mottled grey-brown.~
   This pelt looks to have been cut from the carcass of a great 
wolf, or warg - it is massive enough to drape over the shoulders 
and back of a grown man. It also looks, however, to have not yet 
been tanned: slightly stiff, it does not have the natural give of 
an entirely supple skin and is slightly coarse on the underside. 
The thick fur of this pelt, however, is in fair condition; it is 
a mottled, grey-brown in hue and crisscrossed with numerous 
scars, running jagged lines through the furry ruff. The skin of 
the fore and hindquarters of the animal have been meticulously 
preserved and scraped clean. Thin leather cording has been 
strung through two small holes poked into the neck skin of the 
pelt, enabling this to be worn much the same as a cloak.

a coloured drawing of a woman by a fire~
A coloured drawing of a woman by a fire is set carefully here.~
   Drawn in coloured pencil, this smooth sheet of clear white 
parchment shows a picture of a beautiful woman. She sits next to 
a roaring fireplace, and upon an elegant bear-skin rug, the 
smooth pelt rising up around her, several shades of yellow and 
red used to captured the heat of the log fire. She lies at an 
angle, her left hand resting down her hip, the other holding her 
upright. Upon her left, a thin band of golden-yellow has been 
drawn around a finger, framed with stark black lines which bring 
attention to it. She wears only a crumpled deep blue shirt, 
which does little to conceal her. The shirt hangs open and loose 
on her frame, hugging her hips and accenting her bare breasts. 
Her posture exposes the swell of her bust and slope of her 
stomach, several shades of pink and a light tone of brown frame 
her chest, her pale skin given colour by the thin shading. 
Around her neck, a bronze shaded chain lies, coloured a dusky 
bronze, draping to hang just above her ample cleavage. Her 
strawberry hued lips are shaded so, pursed in a soft smile. 
Framing her face, long silky locks of crimson hair fall, running 
freely down her shoulders, several shades of red and several 
strokes of black give it colour. It frames her perfect face and 
slender shoulders. She stares longingly out of the picture at 
you, her sparkingly eyes mixed with light and dark shades of 
blue, around which, a few subtle strokes of black frame both 
eyes.

   This crossbow is a fine example of yrkish ingenuity and 
resourcefulness. The prod is a composite of bones from an 
undeterminable creature wrapped in stiffened sinew, lending it an 
extremely stiff draw. The stock has similarly been fashioned 
from a frame of bone joined staunchly by steel joints. To 
overcome the tension of the prod, a basic cranequin has been 
constructed on the left side of the stock. Comprising of a small 
steel bone-spoked wheel, when cranked it provides sufficient 
leverage to draw the prod taunt with ease. A simple steel peep 
sight has also been affixed to assist the user's aim. a sharply 
hooked horn has been affixed to its underside allowing for the 
weapon to be hung from a belt.

counter-balance the blade.

A dense cloak of rotting hide rests here, rumpled in a heap.~
   This dense, brown-fur wolf cloak has been poorly treated; its 
ridden with fleas and covered with patches of mud and blood. The 
fur itself, in quality is bad, the once raw inside rotting itself 
away, eating maliciously at the stinking interior. The smell 
that wafts from the folds of this poorly made cloak is 
horrendous, the acidic smell that would burn the insides of 
nostrils. A fold has been made at the top of this length of fur, 
cut on either side and bent in, a lace of lashing threaded 
through to hold up a depthy hood, which would hide the face of 
its wearer in pure darkness. Although weighty, this cloak would 
offer ample protection against the harsh elements it might face.

side is flattened, with two straps of braided cloth that allow 
the basket to be worn on the back. A simple flap of oiled 
leather allows the top to be closed, secured tightly with a 
slender belt.

a crude gut-bag~
A crude bag made from gut and coils of rope.~
   Made of the insides of an unknown creature, this mass of 
treated gut has been stitched with patches of slimy leather and 
wrapped at the top and bottom with thin coils of rope. It 
functions as a crude and foul bag, the rope at one end used as a 
draw string to open and close it, while the lower portion has 
been wrapped tightly in many complex knots. Its smell is 
overpowering and likely clings to any items held inside.

a pair of fine, iron-hobbed leather boots~
A pair of fine, iron-hobbed leather boots lie here, soles covered with iron hobnails.~
   "Clearly fashioned from high-quality materials and a deft 
hand. This pair of brown leather boots stand at being both waxed 
and treated to form a thick barrier against the harshest of 
elements. Along the heel and toe they have had horseshoes of 
dark iron hammered in before being further riveted with a series 
of uniformly fashioned hob nails, each one coming to a wicked 
point and spaced out evenly. While walking becomes awkward on 
smooth and hard surfaces they would undoubtedly offer strong 
support on loose or otherwise hazardous terrain."

A man, apparently starved unto death, lies here.~
   This being has met a very evident unfortunate end. No blade 
has pierced their skin, no bruise or broken bone explains their 
fate. It appears that this relatively young man has merely 
wasted to death. The corpse while relatively fresh, evidences no 
fat nor extra flesh anywhere on its form. No pox nor other 
indicator of disease can be seen. Their fingers have been gnawed 
down to the second knuckle and their tongue is missing in their 
mouth.
