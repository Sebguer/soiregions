a blazing, blue-eyed human corpse wrapped in rotting flesh~
A rotted human corpse floats in the water.~
   A blazing blue light emanates from the haggard eye sockets of 
this corpse, and it moves with a sluggish force to whatever has 
fallen within its supernatural gaze. Ancient beyond all messure, 
the flesh of this corpse, roughly human in shape, hang in pale 
tatters off its bleach-white bones. All the finer details - 
lips, hair, nose, - have long been stripped away from this body 
by the progression of years, the gender of the body unable to be 
determined. The hands, however, are bent and shaped into wicked 
talons, black stains covering the bony extremities.

an emaciated, sallow-skinned elvish corpse~
An emaciated, sallow-skinned corpse lies in the water here.~
   A pale, eerie light shines forth from the eyeless holes in the 
face of this corpse, its facial expression strangely serene. The 
delicate skin is a sickly, sallow colour, drawn tight over the 
rigid bones of this elvish cadaver. Thin, bony arms end in 
blackened talons, which move with slow yet oddly graceful 
movements. Of slender build, the bones of this corpse are 
clearly visible beneath the discoloured flesh.

A mud-mummified, red-eyed orcish corpse drifts here.~
   A smoldering, incandescent crimson glow shines dully where the 
eyes belong on this orcish corpse, the light trailing slightly 
behind the movements of this animated cadaver. The corpse's 
thick frame is wrapped densely in a layer of sticky mud, yet a 
pair of wicked, claw-shaped hands can be clearly seen at the end 
of its arms. This foul remnants of an orc moves in halting, 
jerking movements.

An average-looking warg prototype is here, waiting to be randomized.~
   A set of long yellowed fangs dominates the angular face of 
this sizeable warg. Well over half the height of a man at its 
shoulder, its body is covered in thick, ropy muscle. Wiry and 
sleek in build, it appears to be of middle age, and seems to be 
healthy enough.

an exceptionally vicious-looking warg~
An exceptionally vicious-looking warg is here, waiting to be randomized.~
   Absolutely massive for one of its kind, this powerfully-built 
warg moves with unnerving grace and precision. Possessed of 
jagged, lethally sharp fangs, and a thick, healthy mane of fur, 
there is little doubt that this animal is currently in its prime. 
Its muscle is well-toned and amply distributed, and it appears to 
be, in all, quite a menacing figure.

small pointed goatee. His eyes are a deep sea-green, much in 
contrast to his darker features.

A sleek dog with coarse grey fur idly sniffs at the air.~
This dog is very much larger than an average dog, its body lithe 
and muscular, and accordingly seems to move with a almost silent 
grace, slipping past with barely a sound. Coarse grey fur tipped 
in black covers it's body, ending in a complete black tail.  A pair 
of light blue eyes look out from beyond its long, narrow snout, 
and over all that it observes. One with a trained eyes for dogs
would know this is a pure-bred Wuldane.

a large, dark-furred wolf with deep gold eyes~
A large, dark-furred wolf paces here searching with deep gold eyes.~
   Showing many of the signs of being raised in captivity such as 
being larger then the average wolf, this beast holds itself up to 
a mans waist in height. Deep, golden eyes search about its 
habitat almost lazily, its pink tongue sticking out as it pants 
breathing in and out quickly. Circles of white fur surround the 
eyes and touch the bottom of the mouth making the wolf look 
almost as if it were wearing a mask. Sleek, night-black fur 
leads from the tip of its slightly bushy tail to the tops of its 
triangular gray-tipped ears.

ostler plump homely lass young CULT_OF_MORGOTH_OSTLER~
a plump, homely lass~
A plump young homely lass stands here, taking in horses and other livestock.~
   This young lass is perhaps just shy of leaving her teens, with 
long curly ringlets of dirty blonde hair. She is quite plump, 
with generously proportioned bosoms and wide, child-bearing hips. 
Her face is round and she has dimples when she smiles. Her 
features are homely, more pleasant and hearthy than attractive.

   Long dark hair falls from the top of this elderly man's head, 
reaching almost midway down his back. A pair of sapphire blue 
eyes are set within his slightly wrinkled face. A long regal 
nose is set above full lips, giving brief glimpses of straight 
white teeth.

A tall pale-coated stallion stands here proudly.~
   This fine specimen of a horse appears quick and fleet of hoof. 
He bears himself proudly, moving with long, sure steps. His 
muscled chest and sleek form mark him as a powerful but nimble 
steed, and his shiny pale coat grants him a captivating look. 
His mane is cut long, but is drawn back across his neck, 
well-brushed and finely kempt. His eyes are blue as the sky, 
reflective and beautiful.

a tall swarthy man~
A tall swarthy man with long ebon braids.~
   Blue eyes, clear and crystal, contrast starkly against the 
dark, olive hue of this man's skin. They peer out brightly, and 
intently with a confidence and purpose that belies experience. 
Though rugged in appearance, an immaculately kept goatee adds a 
rakish flare to his already roguish appeal. Long ebon braids 
fall to his shoulders, those made of his bangs tired back by a 
leather thong behind his head.

A deep red-brown bay stallion stands here proudly.~
   This blood bay stallion has obviously been very well taken 
care of. A shiny, deep red-brown coat covers his body, except 
for the nose, which is coated in black hair. His mane and tail 
are a silky midnight black color, tiny braids weaved into some of 
the hair. Strong, slender legs lie below strong haunches, the 
proud stature of the horse showing off the long neck and gentle 
curve of his back.

a bow-legged, hazel-eyed man~
A bow-legged man with hazel-hued eyes stands here.~
   Of average size and build, this man's legs bow outward at the 
knee. Although he wears his coal-black hair neat and tidy, 
cropped close to his scalp, his angular chin and chiseled cheeks 
are most often covered in black stubble. His earthy, hazel-hued 
eyes sit beneath a pair of unruly black eyebrows that almost 
touch in the middle. Slanting to the left and somewhat crooked, 
his nose appears to have suffered some injury in the past. When 
this man smiles there is a noticeable gap where a front tooth 
should be.

a short-muzzled, dark-brown-colored stallion~
A short-muzzled, dark-brown-colored stallion is here.~
   Standing roughly at the height of a man's shoulder, this horse
maintains a proud and dignified facade. Its head is held high,
intelligent eyes glaring out into the distance, and a thick,
healthy-looking mane runs down the back of its neck. Its coat
appears well-cared-for, and a thick, knotted layer of muscle
ripples gracefully beneath its sleek skin.

Aleni Monar ragged flesh blackened appendages wight~
a wight of ragged flesh and blackened appendages~
A wight of ragged flesh and blackened appendages moves about the area.~
   This creature moves with its back hunched, but otherwise with 
a seeming sense of purpose. It moves swiftly about whatever area 
its in as if it were always about some business or other rather 
than any sort of mindless shuffle. The flesh of the wight's 
fingers, however, have been worn away, leaving harsh stubbins of 
bone that protrude from the blackened flesh. Its bare feet make 
an odd clacking sound as the bones of its heels touch the stone 
beneath with every stride. Its hair, whatever color it 
originally was, has been lost and made a toneless gray that 
floats around its deathly-pale features. The wight's entire 
chest has been torn asunder by a huge, gaping wound that still 
remains open and bloodless, leaving ribs and rotted organs open 
to view.

Sagind PLOT_NPC_DO_NOT_USE shaggy headed man murky complexion~
a shaggy-headed man with murky complexion~
A shaggy-headed man with murky complexion stands here.~
This man's lineage looks rather suspect to say the least, with slightly narrowed eyes, skin that is of a darker shade than mere sun could do alone, and possessed of narrow, angular features. The man's hair is a tangled, chaotic mass atop his head, roughly shoulder length and seeming to be of oily, thick nature. His features have a nigh on permanently sullen cast, eyes looking constantly about with an inherent wariness and caution of manner and bearing.

warg formless dropbox wetlands marsh formless Gothakra Cave~
a formless warg~
A formless warg prowls here.~
   This warg is full grown, and particularly bulky and heavy for 
one of its sort, the forefront of its furry body even more 
muscular, massive front paws and shoulders bristling with muscle. 
Its head is a rough, blockish shape, save for the snout which 
extends from beneath a pair of red-tinted, highly intelligent 
eyes. This warg lopes in feral movements, far from graceful, but 
with its weight and thick fur that looks as if it could turn 
swordblades, it more than makes up for this.

a twitchy, wild-eyed snaga~
A twitchy, wild-eyed snaga skitters about the group of orkin, hawking wares.~
   This little goblin is absolutely laden with various odds and 
ends, and backpacks them throughout the group, cat-calling and 
hawking as loudly as he can to try and attract the attention of 
larger orkin. He pushes a cart before him, as laden with goods 
as he, and screeches noisely at all hours of the day and night.
