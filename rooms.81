The Base of a Scenic Waterfall~
   Splashing down from a great distance above, water roars over 
the falls above and pools here in a turbulent mass of whitewater 
and broken rocks, creating a true hazard to any unskilled swimmer 
unfortunate enough to stumble here. Not far from the base of the 
falls, however, the water begins to smooth considerably, the 
tumultuous currents ebbing away into a brook that carries the 
water down towards the next series of pools.

Fertile Farm Lands~
   Verdant fields grow bountiful crops in this area of the Near 
Harad. Shepherds sit by campfire light as their flocks graze 
peacefully in the night. Numerous adobe cottages adorn the 
green, fertile plains, their tiny lights dancing like fireflies 
against the velvety, dark of distance. Many paths and wagon 
tracks cut across the cultivated lands, leading between the 
various farmsteads and the city gate to the west and the long 
snaking Harad Road beyond. To vast fertile plains stretch to the 
east. The horizon stretches in all directions.

Sparse Farmlands~
   The farmlands continue for some distance, but give way to 
intermittent thick copses of wood. Grasses tall and wild grow 
close forming a blanket of thick, lush green. Sweet smelling 
foliage, knee high to a full grown man covers the ground and 
offers little obstacle to travelers but conceals anything that 
might make its way upon the ground. The warm climate here offers 
a rich environment for large and small animals, birds and a 
myriad insects to make their homes.

Amongst Tilled Fields~
   Sweet smelling foilage, knee high to a full grown man covers 
the ground and offers little obstacle to travelers but conceals 
anything that might make its way upon the ground. All around the 
farmlands continue some dotted here and there with a patch of 
thick woods. Fields of wheat ripple gently in the breeze, while 
other fields lay fallow to rest. Birds coo softly as they search 
through the thick foilage underfoot for food. In the distance to 
the west the road leading into the city looms shimmering under 
the unforgiving sky of the Near Harad.

Tended Fields~
   Farmlands and fields stretch westward from the vast eastern 
plains, dotted by the occasional thick copse of woods. Fields of 
wheat ripple and sway gently caressed by the gentle winds from 
the north. A small burned patch of ground scars the green of a 
close field, where stalks of wheat lay stubbled and ruined. The 
humming of insects plays a soft symphony to accompany the subtle 
rustle of small ground dwelling animals. To the west looms the 
road leading into the city while to far west the great Harad Road 
meanders north and south across the plains beneath the harsh sky 
of the Near Harad.

Pasture Land~
   The fields here are lightly dappled with trees bordering the 
fields stretching northward. Flocks of sheep, tended by robed 
shepherds roam and graze contentedly on the tall, wild grasses of 
these untilled fields. The soft braying accompanies the caw of 
birds from above as they swoop down on their prey hidden in the 
thick, green foliage as tall as a man's knee. Tracks of carts 
and wagons mar the ground and the road into the city shimmers to 
the west beneath the harsh southern sky, while beyond farmlands 
continue to the Great Harad Road.

and wagons mar the ground and the road into the city looms as a

A Roadside Trench~
   The fields here are thick with tall, wild grasses while 
sycamore fig trees form a tight grove to the north. Near the 
road the ground is hard and scarred with ruts from cart and wagon 
wheels. A trench runs along side the road, filled with stagnant 
green liquid. Insects buzz over the trench while a gentle lap 
sounds as a water dweller breaks the surface of the still green 
covered water. A steady stream of traffic leads to and fro the 
city, mounted and on foot they make their while caravans snake to 
and fro. Vast fertile fields continue to the east and the tilled 
fields continue to the west beyond the road.

   The night breeze caresses the thick, tall, wild grasses and 
they sway gently. Sycamore fig trees form a tight grove a bit to 
the north. Near the road the ground is hard and scarred with 
ruts from cart and wagon wheels. A trench runs along side the 
road, filled with stagnant green liquid. Night offers sanctuary 
to predatory insects humming over the trench while a gentle lap 
sounds as a water dweller breaks the surface of the still green 
covered water. The traffic lighter at night flowing to and from 
the city, mounted and on foot they make their while caravans 
snake slowly to and fro. Vast fertile fields continue to the 
east and the tilled fields continue to the west beyond the road 
under the dark, southern sky.

A Roadside Trench~
   The grasses here are thick but stunted and patchy from wagons, 
and cart wheels. Foot traffic approaching the city has dulled 
the lushness of the more distant fields. A deep man made trench 
runs along side the road, its stagnant green liquid acrid 
smelling. Insects hover lazily over the trench while the 
occasional splash tells of life beneath the bright green blanket 
covering the water beneath it. Caravans move slowly to and from 
the gates to the south. To the east lay the vast fertile fields 
of the valley and to the west the tilled fields continue beyond 
the road.

Fig Groves~
   Neat lines of planted fig trees line the fields here. The 
dense grasses and foilage hacked back and a border burned to slow 
encroachment. Workers busily go about tending the trees, baskets 
strapped to their backs, while others cut away dead leaves or 
strangling weeds. Carts filled with baskets clutter an open area 
between the groves. Birds twitter about the trees seeking any 
delectable fruits left by the pickers. The sweet smells draw 
insects who hum and buzz about the wide leaves of the small 
trees. The the east the verdant fields continue. To the west 
the road leading to the city can be seen. To the south looms the 
city wall and to the north wheat fields sway in the gentle 
breeze.

   Neat lines of planted fig trees line the fields here. The 
dense grasses and foilage hacked back and a border burned to slow 
encroachment. With the night the workers recede from the grove 
leaving their marks upon the trampled ground around the trees. 
The cleaning is crisscrossed with deep ruts from cart wheels. 
Night sounds surround the trees and conceals the animals rustling 
the wide leaves of the trees. The sweet smells of the grove draw 
the birds of the night near. The the east the verdant fields 
continue. To the west the road leading to the city can be looms 
in the dark. To the south throw a darker shade of night across 
the ground. To the north wheat fields whisper in the night 
gentle breeze.

Amidst Some Wheat Fields~
   Verdant fields grow bountiful crops in this area of the Near 
Harad. Tall, wild grasses grow close forming a blanket of thick, 
dense green. Wheat fields sway gently in the soft, warm breeze, 
while other fields are given over to pasture. The soft loam 
offers homes to small ground dwelling animals while butterflys 
lazily float amidst the foliage. The harsh call of a bird of 
prey wafts down from above. In all directions the fertile land 
continues.

Pasture Land~
   Foliage thick and dense covers the ground. The ground is hard 
in patches and crisscrossed with wagon ruts. Tilled fields lay 
to the northern end and fields of wheat dance gently to the wind. 
A barley field peeks out here and there from between the many 
neat rows of wheat. The rustle of small animals are heard within 
the foliage and birds coo softly as they curiously fly in to 
watch the scarved archers staring relentlessly into the distance. 
The sturdy walls of the city lay to the west. The horizon 
continues in all directions.

A barley field peeks out here and there from between the many

sturdy walls loom to the west. The horizon continues in all

Farmlands~
   Adobe cottages adorn the green, fertile plains, that stretch 
into the distances. The fields here are lightly dappled with 
trees bordering the fields stretching northward. Flocks of 
sheep, graze contentedly on the tall, wild grasses of these 
untilled fields. Tracks of carts and wagons mar the ground and 
the road into the city shimmers in the distance, the unforgiving 
southern sky, and beyond farmlands continue to the Great Harad 
Road.

huddle near their campfires as the soft braying of the sheep 
accompany the shrill calls of night birds from above as they 
swoop down on thier prey hidden in the thick, green foilage as 
tall as a man's knee.

Tilled Fields~
   Sweet smelling foilage, covers the ground growing right up 
against the tall walls of the city. To the north are neat fig 
groves and farmlands continue to the east dotted here and there 
with a patch of thick woods. Flocks of sheep, tended by robed 
shepherds roam and graze contentedly on the tall, wild grasses of 
these untilled fields. The Gates of the city lay to west and 
beyond the road the farmlands continue. The quiet soldiers keep 
their vigil atop the walls their gaze never faultering from the

Roadside by The Gates~
   The massive city gates lay to the west. Traffic is heavy as 
travellers make their way to and from the city. The tall adobe 
walls stop the advance of the tall grasses and foilage. On 
either side of the road cobble stones are laid in an wide apron 
offering clean and easy entry to gates free of the encroaching 
plains. Scarved archers move atop the walls in endless patrols, 
their gaze facing away from the city. The noise of the city 
seeps out through the gates chasing predatory animals from its 
vicinity. On the far side of the road is laid a twin apron of 
cobbles and the sturdy city wall continues west. In the east the 
wall stretches, its stout adobe offering protection to the 
denizens.

   Soft grasses lead up to a thin strand of course yellow sand

trees grow near the water, dipping their long fronds into the 
slow moving river. The sound of a fish breaking the surface 
echos across the lazy water. Sea birds glide gracefully, 
following the long rivers bounty as it winds its way towards the

Before The Carved Gates~
   Intricately carved, heavy, iron gates block the way south. 
Twice the height of an average man they curve upwards to meet the 
arch in the thick, adobe walls. Sentrys of the famed Silvermoon 
Cobra, with dark, scarves hiding their features patrol the portal 
on either side and archers line the walls atop the gate house. 
The gates bustle with activity as travellers and caravans enter 
and leave. Angry shouts and loud laughter mingle with the 
bellows of animals, ring out from amongst the traffic. The road 
is paved here, shimmering beneath the unforgiving, harsh southern 
sky.

Roadside Trench~

hover lazily over the trench while the occasional splash tells of 
life beneath the bright green blanket covering the water beneath 
it. The grasses here are thick but stunted and patchy from

   The ground here is flat, mixed tilled and fallow fields are 
dotted with small groves and pastures that stretch in all 
directions. The city can be seen in the distance, its bright 
lights sparkling like fireflies against the black velvet of the 
southern sky. Numerous adobe cottages adorn the green, fertile 
plains, their inhabitants finished with their long day's work. 
Many paths and wagon tracks cut across the cultivated lands, 
leading between the various farmsteads and the city gate to the 
east and the long snaking Harad Road to the west.

Tended Fields~
   The intense southern sky beats down upon the fields of wheat 
and barley. Grasses tall and wild grow close forming a blanket 
of thick, lush green. Stretching into the distance in all 
directions the tended fields are broken by pasture land and the 
occasional grove of fig trees. The warm climate here offers a 
rich environment for large and small animals, birds and a myriad 
insects to make their homes. The ground here is flat, mixed 
tilled and fallow fields are dotted with small groves and 
pastures that stretch in all directions.

Amidst The Farmlands~
   The farmlands continue for some distance, but give way to 
intermittent thick copses of wood. The city can be seen in the 
eastern distance from the neat fields of wheat and barley, it's 
sturdy adobe walls rising against the harsh southern, sky. 
Fields of wheat ripple gently in the breeze, while other fields 
lay fallow to rest. The sweet smell of the dense ground cover 
wafts up as it disturbed by the wind and small mammals scurrying 
within the knee high foliage.

the distance from the neat fields of wheat and barley, it's 
sturdy adobe walls dotted by scarved sentries keeping a watchful 
outward gaze across the land. Sweet smelling foliage, knee high 
to a full grown man covers the ground and offers little obstacle 
to travelers but conceals anything that might make its way upon 
the ground. Birds coo softly as they search through the thick 
foliage underfoot for food. In the distance to the north the

Broad Fields~
   The broad fields of the Near Harad are wild and overgrown 
here. In every direction the plains stretch out, its green and 
fertile earth broken by wind seared patches, barren of the wild 
grasses and riddled with hard, sandy soil. Bare ground, hard and 
sandy, scored by the relentless winds break the quiet beauty of 
the tall grasses that grow thick here. Dried grasses crackle 
underfoot, as a wind seared scar of ground scrapes its way 
through the lush green of the thick, wild grasses.

   Willow trees grow near the water, dipping their long fronds 
into the slow moving river. The sound of a fish breaking the 
surface echos across the lazy water. The sound of a ship's bell, 
while set at anchor in the dark southern night echos across 
expanse of water as it winds its way towards the Bay of Belfalas 
from the mountains of the northeast. Soft grasses lead up to a 
thin strand of course yellow sand where it meets the gentle 
lapping of the Sheshem Mew.

At The River's Edge~
   Verdant fields grow bountiful crops right to the water's edge 
here. From the neat fields of wheat and barley, lay in the 
eastern distance the city walls it's sturdy adobe walls reaching 
up from the flat plains towards the unforgiving harsh sky of the 
Near Harad. Untilled fields revert to pasture lands where tall 
wild grasses grow thick accompanied by lush foliage. The soft 
loam offers homes to small ground dwelling animals. The Sheshem 
Mew laps gently at the thin strand of coarse yellow where the 
fields end.

Amidst Fields of Wheat~
   The wild grasses continue in all directions, tamed by crops 
and groves as the farmers work their fields. n excellent view of 
the countryside of the Near Harad is offered from this vantage 
point, the fertile plains present in all directions. A barley 
field peeks out here and there from between the many neat rows of 
wheat. Some fields are left fallow while others are freshly 
tilled, its earthy aroma wafting up from newly turned earth. The 
sweet smell of the dense ground cover wafts up as it disturbed by 
the wind and small mammals scurrying within the knee high 
foliage.

Fields South of a Road~
   Stretching to the western cost to the mountains in the 
northeast to the unbroken southern reaches of the Haradwaith, the 
plains continue. Birds coo softly as they search through the 
thick foliage underfoot for food. In the distance to the north 
the road leading into the city looms shimmering under the 
unforgiving sky of the Near Harad. An undergrowth, of patchy 
shrubs accented with thick and heavy leaves, huddles beneath a 
malformed, wild fig. A small rise in the terrain offers a rare 
vantage point on the grass-covered lands in all directions.

   Winding its way thought the verdant plains, the road turns 
here, its scarred surface, showing its age and heavy traffic. To 
the south the road continues across the plains and to the west it 
meanders its way to The Harad Road beyond. A patch of wild 
barley grows at the side of the road and a small grove of stunted 
cypress block the view to the west. To the east and north the 
flatlands continue, wild grasses and heavy foliage stretch to the

Untamed Plains~
   The untamed fertile plains of the Near Harad can be seen in 
every direction. The Great Harad road lays to the west as it 
snakes it way across the land. While the Share'a Fahad meanders 
to the north and east carrying traffic to and from the city to 
the east. The tall grasses rustle with the movement of the small 
wildlife concealed with its dense green and whisper on the soft 
breeze from the north. A stunted cypress tree grows here 
affording little shade against the harsh southern sky.

Vast Unbroken Plains~
   The flat plains of the Near Harad stretch in all directions, 
verdant green but broken by parched, dry grasses and foliage. 
Fields of wheat ripple gently in the breeze, while other fields 
lay fallow to rest. The tall grasses rustle with the movement of 
the small wildlife concealed with its dense green. The warm 
climate here offers a rich environment for large and small 
animals, birds and a myriad insects to make their homes. A bird 
calls out shrilly from overhead.

Flat Plains~
   An excellent view of the countryside of the Near Harad is 
offered from this vantage point, the fertile plains present in 
all directions. The sweet smell of the dense ground cover wafts 
up as it disturbed by the wind and small mammals scurrying within 
the knee high foliage seeking safety from predators. Wild barley 
grows in small patches from between the thick, wild grasses. A 
barren patch of earth mars its beauty while insects hover over 
the wild grasses.

Broad Fields~
   The broad fields of the Near Harad are wild and overgrown 
here. Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and rustle with the 
small wildlife that hide with its thick, green blanket. Vast 
fertile plains span every direction, as the horizon stretches out 
along the rich, fields of the southern plains. The squall of a 
flock of birds echo on the wind as they turn in their flight 
westward towards the great bay and sea. Ground, dappled with 
grasses, some green, some dried, feels hard underfoot, torn by 
the restless wind endlessly blowing from the southeast.

A Small Seep~
   Deep ruts from carts and wagons scar the soft ground crushing 
the sweet smelling foliage in their paths. Flat and green the 
plains spread out in a seamless never ending stretch in all 
directions, with only stunted trees to break on the horizon. The 
swaying green of the tall, plains grasses ripple as far as the 
eye can see in every direction. A small seep forms a muddy 
puddle of fresh water, offering its cool, refreshment to 
predators and prey alike. The long, swaying grass of the plains 
continues in every direction.

underfoot, mars the stark beauty of the verdant plains stretching

water, offering its cool, refreshment to predators and prey 
alike. A small area of broken grass juts up against the twisted

unforgiving southern sky. The squall of a flock of birds echo on

scar of ground scrapes its way through the lush green of the

   The flat fertile plains extend in every direction, covered in 
thick grasses which range from two to four feet in height, 
adorned with tilled and fallow fields. The tall grasses rustle 
with the movement of the small wildlife concealed with its dense 
green. An undergrowth, of patchy shrubs accented with thick and

branches out to offer protection from the cool, night sky. 
Insects hover over the thick grasses and foliage, while small 
animals rustle through the tall grasses.

Flat Green Plains~
   In the distance the heat shimmers across the green fields of 
the plains, scarred by barren, patches of hard earth. Deep ruts 
from carts and wagons scar the soft ground crushing the sweet 
smelling foliage in their paths. Bare ground, hard and sandy, 
scored by the relentless winds break the quiet beauty of the tall 
grasses that grow thick here. Burrows dot the soft earth within 
the dense foliage, small animals peek out wary of larger 
predators who lurk nearby. The harsh sky of the south beats down 
on the plains with unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the 
tireless winds from the southeast.

Fields of Wild Grass~
   Stretching to the western cost to the mountains in the 
northeast to the unbroken southern reaches of the Haradwaith, the 
plains continue. Broken by the infrequent copse of stunted 
threes the untamed plains continue in all directions, the warm 
winds it's constant companion. The swaying green of the tall, 
plains grasses ripple as far as the eye can see in every 
directions. Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and rustle 
with the small wildlife that hide with its thick, green blanket. 
In all directions the plains continue, the lush green carpet 
marred by the occasional hard, arid stretch of ground.

Flat Plains~
   The flat fertile plains extend in every direction, covered in 
thick grasses which range from two to four feet in height, 
bending against the warm wind. Birds coo softly as they search 
through the thick foliage underfoot for food. Wild wheat grows 
here, golden and tall, surrounded by thick, ground covering 
foliage, it's sweet smell lingering on the wind. Dried grasses 
crackle underfoot, as a wind seared scar of ground scrapes its 
way through the lush green of the thick, wild grasses.

   The broad fields of the Near Harad are wild and overgrown 
here. Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and rustle with the 
small wildlife that hide with its thick, green blanket. Vast 
fertile plains stretch to the east while the horizon stretches in 
all directions. The sweet smell of the dense ground cover wafts 
up as it disturbed by the wind and small mammals scurrying within

Amidst Knee High Grasses.~
   The harsh sky of the south beats down on the plains with 
unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from the 
southeast. Wagons and caravans rumbles along the distant road, 
transporting goods to and from the city. Sweet smelling foliage, 
knee high to a full grown man covers the ground and offers little 
obstacle to travelers but conceals anything that might make its 
way upon the ground. A small seep forms a muddy puddle of fresh 
water, offering its cool, refreshment to predators and prey 
alike.

   Unbroken on all horizons the plains continue, their tall, wild 
grasses bending from the warm eastern wind. A barren patch of 
earth mars its beauty. Dried grasses crackle underfoot, as a 
wind seared scar of ground scrapes its way through the lush green 
of the thick, wild grasses. Ground, dappled with grasses, some 
green, some dried, feels hard underfoot, torn by the restless 
wind endlessly blowing from the southeast. Burrows dot the soft 
earth within the dense foliage, small animals peek out wary of 
larger predators who lurk nearby.

Dappled Plains~
   The harsh sky of the south beats down on the plains with 
unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from the 
southeast. Ground, dappled with grasses, some green, some dried, 
feels hard underfoot, torn by the restless wind endlessly blowing 
from the southeast. Sweet smelling foliage, knee high to a full 
grown man covers the ground and offers little obstacle to 
travelers but conceals anything that might make its way upon the 
ground. The warm climate here offers a rich environment for 
large and small animals, birds and a myriad insects to make their 
homes.

   Ground, dappled with grasses, some green, some dried, feels 
hard underfoot, torn by the restless wind endlessly blowing from 
the southeast. In every direction the plains stretch out, its 
green and fertile earth broken by wind seared patches, barren of 
the wild grasses and riddled with hard, sandy soil. Sweet 
smelling foliage, knee high to a full grown man covers the ground 
and offers little obstacle to travelers but conceals anything 
that might make its way upon the ground. Night sounds fill the 
cool, air as darkness settles down on the dappled plains.

Wild Wind Torn Fields~
   Sweet grass, soft and tall, ripples as the warm wind sweeps 
across the plains, touching the relentless plains of the 
southland gives way to patchy stubbles of broken, grass set here, 
dominated by hard, dry, cracked dirt. Sweet smelling foliage, 
knee high to a full grown man covers the ground and offers little 
obstacle to travelers but conceals anything that might make its 
way upon the ground recedes before windblasted rocky ground, that 
crouches beneath the never still fine, carpet of fine yellow 
sands.

Bleak Grasslands~
   The harsh sky of the south beats down on the plains with 
unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from the 
southeast. Restless sands blown by the southern winds scour the 
ground of all traces of green. Bleak grasslands accompanied by 
small rocks and larger boulders, litter the plains as the 
unforgiving southern sky takes its toll. Dried grasses crackle 
underfoot, as a wind seared scar of ground scrapes its way 
through the lush green of the thick, wild grasses.

Wind Scoured Fields~
   From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Near Harad is offered to the eye. Green fields fade away to 
harsh yellow sands and brown rocks of the wind ripped plains. 
Dried grasses crackle underfoot, as a wind seared scar of ground 
scrapes its way through the lush green of the thick, wild 
grasses. A dying creek bed dotted with small rocks, its life 
completely carried away on the warm winds of the south.

   Unbroken on all horizons the plains continue, their tall, wild 
grasses bending from the warm eastern wind. An undergrowth, of 
patchy shrubs accented with thick and heavy leaves, huddles 
beneath a malformed, wild fig. Wind blasted rocky ground, 
crouches beneath the never still fine, carpet of fine yellow

   Ground, dappled with grasses, some green, some dried, feels

offering its cool, refreshment to predators and prey alike. The

Stubborn shrubs poke up through hard sandy, ground littered with 
rock. Bare ground, hard and sandy, scored by the relentless 
winds break the quiet beauty of the tall grasses that grow thick 
here. The rocky surface of the once green plains still support

they turn into the arid plains rolling to the east. A small

cushioning the hard rocky ground with its fine powder. A

north. Here the wind has scoured away the sand baring for a 
short time the hard cracked, parched ground beneath the shifting 
sands of the Great Desert. The sand is fine and pale, yellow, 
easily carried by the wind as it howls across the valleys and

Shifting Sands~
   As far as the eye can see the great heaving dunes of sand 
continue. The hot desert wind, never still, shifts the landscape 
with neverending patience. Like the waves of the sea the dunes 
heave and change. Travel is difficult, as the soft sand makes 
footing uneven. The trough of the dunes afford little comfort 
from the unforgiving sky and sweltering winds of the south and 
east. Desert life is sparse and rugged and occasional bird of 
prey is seen in flight as it casts its shadow upon the wind, 
seared sands. The shifting sands continue to the far reaches of 
the southland.

   Unbroken on all horizons the plains continue, their tall, wild 
grasses bending from the warm eastern wind. A barren patch of 
earth mars its beauty. Dried grasses crackle underfoot, as a 
wind seared scar of ground scrapes its way through the lush green 
of the thick, wild grasses. Ground, dappled with grasses, some 
green, some dried, feels hard underfoot, torn by the restless 
wind endlessly blowing from the southeast. Burrows dot the soft 
earth within the dense foliage, small animals peek out wary of 
larger predators who lurk nearby.

   The broad fields of the Near Harad are wild and overgrown

of tall grasses, it's lights sparkling like diamonds agianst the 
black, velvet sky of the south. A patch of wild barley field 
peeks out here and there from between the lush grasses. Some 
thick foliage covers the fields while loose rocks dot the soft 
earth, its damp aroma wafting up from amidst the thick ground 
cover.

Wild Grasslands~
   The untamed fields continue for some distance, but give way to 
intermittent thick copses of wood. Fields of soft, wild grasses 
ripple gently ont the warm breeze, while other fields lay fallow 
to rest. A small seep forms a muddy puddle of fresh water, 
offering its cool, refreshment to predators and prey alike. The 
sweet smell of the dense ground cover wafts up as it disturbed by 
the wind and small, nocturnal mammals scurrying within the knee 
high foliage.

Receding Fertile Plains~
   A stretch of parched earth, the ground hard and sandy 
underfoot, mars the stark beauty of the verdant plains stretching 
in all directions. Dried grasses crackle underfoot, as a wind 
seared scar of ground scrapes its way through the lush green of 
the thick, wild grasses. Restless sands blown by the southern 
winds scour the ground of all traces of green. A shallow, muddy 
bottomed creek is hidden amongst seemingly endless plains.

Semi-Arid Plains~
   Broken by the infrequent copse of stunted threes the untamed 
plains continue in all directions, the warm winds it's constant 
companion. Bleak grasslands accompanied by small rocks and 
larger boulders, litter the plains as the unforgiving southern 
sky takes its toll. The swaying green of the tall, plains 
grasses ripple as far as the eye can see in every direction. The 
warm climate here offers a rich environment for large and small 
animals, birds and a myriad insects to make their homes.

A Small Creek~
   The harsh sky of the south beats down on the plains with 
unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from the 
southeast. Sweet smelling foliage, knee high to a full grown man 
covers the ground and offers little obstacle to travelers but 
conceals anything that might make its way upon the ground. A 
barren patch of earth mars its beauty. A small creek forms a 
muddy puddle of fresh water, offering its cool, refreshment to 
predators and prey alike.

offering its cool, refreshment to predators and prey alike. A 
grove of dead trees, bark brittle and grey, the chance to discern 
the species long lost. Ground, dappled with grasses, some green, 
some dried, feels hard underfoot, torn by the restless wind 
endlessly blowing from the southeast. The dark, velvety blanket 
of night settles over the southlands.

Semi-Arid Plains~
   From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Near Harad is offered to the eye. A barren patch of earth 
mars its beauty. The tall, wild grass of the plains retreat 
leaving a waste of dried stalks and bare rock, and unadorned 
plain. Bleak grasslands accompanied by small rocks and larger 
boulders, litter the plains as the unforgiving southern sky takes 
its toll.

Dappled Grasslands~
   The flat fertile plains extend in every direction, covered in 
thick grasses which range from two to four feet in height, dried 
grasses marring its lush beauty. Ground, dappled with grasses, 
some green, some dried, feels hard underfoot, torn by the 
restless wind endlessly blowing from the southeast. The flat 
plains of the Near Harad continue in all directions, verdant 
green but broken by parched, dry grasses and foliage. The tall 
grasses rustle with the movement of the small wildlife concealed 
with its dense green.

Drying Plains~
   A stretch of parched earth, the ground hard and sandy 
underfoot, mars the stark beauty of the verdant plains stretching 
in all directions. An undergrowth, of patchy shrubs accented 
with thick and heavy leaves, huddles beneath a malformed, wild 
fig. A small seep forms a muddy puddle of fresh water, offering 
its cool, refreshment to predators and prey alike. A clearing in 
the grass, crafted from a water-starved cracking hard, dirt 
ground, devoid of any plant life, scars the field.

Wind Scoured Plains~
   The flat plains of the Near Harad stretch in all directions, 
verdant green but broken by parched, dry grasses and foliage. A 
small hill, surrounded by flat ground looks over the land as far 
as the eye can see offering a view over the land as it descends 
from fertile plains to arid desert. Bare ground, hard and sandy, 
scored by the relentless winds break the quiet beauty of the tall 
grasses that grow thick here. The tall grasses rustle with the 
movement of the small wildlife concealed with its dense green.

hillocks of formed by its ceasless movement across the lands of

   The harsh sky of the south beats down on the plains with 
unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from the 
southeast. Wagons and caravans rumbles along the distant road, 
transporting goods to and from the city. Sweet smelling foliage, 
knee high to a full grown man covers the ground and offers little 
obstacle to travelers but conceals anything that might make its 
way upon the ground. The swift waters of the Harnen lap at the 
sandy strand at the fields edge. The southern night settles down 
upon the land throwing the crystal clear waters into darkness.

A Sandy Bank~
   From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Near Harad is offered to the eye. Wagons and caravans 
rumbles along the distant road, transporting goods to and from 
the city. The swaying green of the tall, plains grasses ripple 
as far as the eye can see in every direction. Birds coo softly 
as they search through the thick foliage underfoot for food. 
Grasses tall and wild grow close forming a blanket of thick, lush 
green. The swift waters of the Harnen lap at the sandy strand at

Rippling Grasses~
   Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and rustle with the 
small wildlife that hide with its thick, green blanket. The 
tall, grasses ripple in endless waves of green as far as the eye 
can see. Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and rustle with 
the small wildlife that hide with its thick, green blanket. A 
grove of dead trees, bark brittle and grey, the chance to discern 
the species long lost.

A Copse of Trees~
   A thin copse of trees huddle here, inviting the weary traveler 
to rest within its shade and the soft green grasses which crouch 
under their stunted boughs. The ground breaks here, falling 
sharply into a tiny ravine, home to a small pool of fresh water. 
A stunted cypress tree here, malformed by the relentless winds, 
spreads its branches out to offer shade from the harsh southern 
sky.

Wild, Grassy Plains~
   Grassy plains, wild and untamed, stretch in every direction 
bending under the restless, warm southern winds. Ground, dappled 
with grasses, some green, some dried, feels hard underfoot, torn 
by the restless wind endlessly blowing from the southeast. The 
flat plains of the Near Harad extend verdant green but broken by 
parched, dry grasses and foliage on the far horizon. The tall 
grasses rustle with the movement of the small wildlife concealed 
with its dense green.

A Shallow Creek~
   From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Near Harad is offered to the eye. Sweet smelling foliage, 
knee high to a full grown man covers the ground and offers little 
obstacle to travelers but conceals anything that might make its 
way upon the ground. A shallow, muddy bottomed creek is hidden 
amongst seemingly endless plains, ending as quickly as it begins. 
Some wild barley peeks out from within the tall grasses.

   The harsh sky of the south beats down on the plains with 
unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from the 
southeast. An undergrowth, of patchy shrubs accented with thick 
and heavy leaves, huddles beneath a malformed, wild fig. The 
tall grasses rustle with the movement of the small wildlife 
concealed with its dense green. The call of a large animal 
carries on the relentless wind as it journey over the fertile 
plains of the south lands.

the fertile plains offers the illusion of steady footing over the

The Far-Reaching Plains~
   Stretching to the western cost to the mountains in the 
northeast to the unbroken southern reaches of the Haradwaith, the 
plains continue. An excellent view of the countryside of the 
Near Harad is offered from this vantage point, the fertile plains 
present in all directions. The tall, wild grass of the plains 
retreat leaving a waste of dried stalks and bare rock, and 
unadorned plain in the distant east. The tall grasses rustle 
with the movement of the small wildlife concealed with its dense 
green.

Flat Fertile Plains~
   The flat fertile plains extend in every direction, covered in 
thick grasses which range from two to four feet in height, 
adorned with fields of wild wheat and barley. Ground, dappled 
with grasses, some green, some dried, feels hard underfoot, torn 
by the restless wind endlessly blowing from the southeast. The 
flat plains of the Near Harad stretch in all directions, verdant 
green but broken by parched, dry grasses and foliage on the far 
horizon. The tall grasses rustle with the movement of the small 
wildlife concealed with its dense green.

Thick Foliage~
   Wild barley and wheat sprout amongst the tall, swaying green, 
wild green grasses. Crushed grasses and muddy patches of silt 
encircle a small seep of fresh water. A small grove of wild nut 
trees, offer shelter to thick foliage and small ground dwellers 
of the planes. Grasses tall and wild grow close forming a 
blanket of thick, lush green. The swaying green of the tall, 
plains grasses ripple as far as the eye can see in every

Waist-High Grass~

sweet grasses in abundance all around it. Waist-high grass of

soft earth of this field. The rocky surface of the once green

   The harsh sky of the south beats down on the plains with 
unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from the 
southeast. Knee high grasses sway beneath the steady, hot winds 
of the southlands. Sweet smelling foliage, knee high to a full

travelers but conceals anything that might make its way upon the

in its direction but offers shelter from the often harsh winds.

fertile flatlands, sway with tall grasses, wild wheat and barley. 
Song birds sit in the stunted cypress trees plying their melodies

small seep forms a muddy puddle of fresh water, offering its 
cool, refreshment to predators and prey alike.

travelers but conceals anything that makes its way low upon the 
ground. The rocky surface of the once green plains still support 
patches of verdant green here. A narrow brooks winds its way 
though the fields.

Fertile Plains~
   Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and rustle with the 
small wildlife that hide with its thick, green blanket. Untamed 
the fertile plains of the Near Harad can be seen in every 
direction intermittently dotted with areas parched of the sweet 
grasses in abundance all around it. Deep ruts from carts and 
wagons scar the soft ground crushing the sweet smelling foliage 
in their paths. The warm climate here offers a rich environment 
for large and small animals, birds and a myriad insects to make 
their homes.

A Field of Wild Barley~
   In the distance the heat shimmers across the green fields of 
the plains, unscarred by barren, patches of hard earth. An 
excellent view of the countryside of the Near Harad is offered 
from this vantage point, the fertile plains present in all 
directions. Wild barley and wheat sprout amongst the tall, 
swaying green, wild green grasses. A flock of long-necked birds 
fly in formation towards the sea in the west.

A Hard Dirt Clearing~
   A small grove of stunted trees offers shelter from the harsh 
southern sky as the plains spread out in all directions. 
Stubborn shrubs poke up through hard sandy, ground littered with 
rock. Bare ground, hard and sandy, scored by the relentless 
winds break the quiet beauty of the tall grasses that grow thick 
here. A clearing in the grass, crafted from a water-starved 
cracking hard, dirt ground devoid of any plant life scars the 
field.

foliage. The tall grasses rustle with the movement of the small 
wildlife concealed with its dense green. The dark, velvety 
blanket of night settles over the southlands.

Within Changing Fields~
   The broad fields of the Near Harad are wild and overgrown 
here. Tall, wild grasses turn to bleak seared ruin as the harsh 
sky of the southern plains couples with the warms winds to tear 
away its vitality. Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and 
rustle with the small wildlife that hide with its thick, green 
blanket. The swaying green of the tall, plains grasses ripple as 
far as the eye can see in every direction.

A Riverbank~
   Sweet grass, soft and tall, ripples as the warm wind sweeps 
across the plains, touching the relentless plains of the 
southland. Stubborn shrubs poke up through hard sandy, ground 
littered with rock. The tall grasses rustle with the movement of 
the small wildlife concealed with its dense green. The sweet 
smell of the dense ground cover wafts up as it disturbed by the 
wind and small mammals scurrying within the knee high foliage. 
Crystal clear waters lap at the thin strand of yellow sand.

A Rocky Bank~
   Untamed the fertile plains of the Near Harad can be seen in 
every direction. Birds coo softly as they search through the 
thick foliage underfoot for food. Deep ruts from carts and 
wagons scar the soft ground crushing the sweet smelling foliage 
in their paths. Flat and green the plains spread out in a 
seamless never ending stretch in all directions, with only 
stunted trees to break on the horizon. The swaying green of the 
tall, plains grasses ripple as far as the eye can see in every

offers the illusion of steady footing over the soft earth of this

every direction intermittently dotted with areas parched of the 
sweet grasses in abundance all around it. Ground, dappled with 
grasses, some green, some dried, feels hard underfoot, torn by 
the restless wind endlessly blowing from the southeast. The flat 
plains of the Near Harad stretch in all directions, verdant green 
but broken by parched, dry grasses and foliage. Birds coo softly 
as they search through the thick foliage underfoot for food.

Wind Seared Plains~

to a seared scar of ground as it scrapes its way through the

hillocks of sand. Desert predators stalk the shifting landscape, 
deadly as merciless as the sweltering wind that sears the heat 
burdened stretches of sand.

hard and sandy, scored by the relentless winds breaks the quiet

   Stretching into the dunes the arid plains continue on past the

green plains lay devoid of any vestiges of green. Bare ground, 
hard and sandy, scored by the relentless winds breaks the quiet

Wind Blown Sands~
   Restless sands blown by the southern winds scour the ground of 
all traces of green fields of the west and north. Stretching 
into the dunes the arid plains continue on past the horizon to 
the south and east. The flat desert plains of the Near Harad 
stretch in all directions, verdant green gone, replaced by 
broken, parched, dry sand covered ground. Desert predators stalk 
the shifting landscape, deadly and as merciless as the sweltering 
wind that sears the heat burdened stretches of sand. A dried 
river bed dotted with small rocks and boulders, crumbles, 
collapsing the ground beneath it making passage north impossible.

Heat Seared Plains~
   Stubborn shrubs poke up through hard sandy, ground littered 
with rock. Wind blasted rocky ground, crouches beneath the never 
still fine, carpet of yellow sands. Dried husks of grasses 
crackle underfoot, carried on the wind to a seared scar of ground 
as it scrapes its way through the thickening hillocks of sand. 
The desert continues in all directions to the far eastern and 
southern reaches of the Near Harad.

A Dead Creek Bed~

yellow sands thicken, cushioning the hard rocky ground with its 
fine powder. A a barren patch of earth mars its beauty of the

with unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from 
the southeast. Here lays a dead creek bed dotted with small 
rocks and boulders, its life completely carried away on the

away on the winds slashes across the wind seared ground. A bird 
of prey circles above before soaring away with his curiousity 
sated. A wide chasm bars the way east. Night winds cool the 
land after the heat of the day.

Before a Yawning Chasm~
   The sand is fine and pale, yellow, easily carried by the wind 
as it howls across the valleys and hillocks of sand. Scavanging 
birds squawk from above as they search the wind scorched land for 
animal life that fell to the harsh environment. Gone are all 
vestiges of the verdant plains of the north and west. Here the 
wind has scoured away the sand baring for a short time the hard 
cracked, parched ground beneath the shifting sands of the Great 
Desert. A yawning chasm bars passage east and north.

and left flank is Dahab'Jundi Al Mara Khadijah, with her 
legendary Silvermoon Dervish. Guarding the rear and flanking on 
the right is the notorious Sha'Jundi Mansur Al-Nahyan and his

Southern Shore Ferry Landing~
   Identical to its northern mooring thick pilings, form the 
framework of this wide dock. Cedar planking, sanded smooth 
stretches from piling to piling spanning out over the deep, blue 
waters of the Harnen. Two tall pilings sit on either side of the 
dock where it touches the shoreline. Two more, taller than the 
latter sit out at the end of the dock, jutting up from the river 
like pillars against the rivers current. thick ropes strung on 
either side of the dock between the big pilings, act as a rail 
along the length of the wide dock. Fishing nets are thrown over 
a rail to dry untangled while the water laps gently at the heavy 
cedar pilings as it flows about their unmoving foundation. 
   A heavy, brass bell to call the ferry, hangs by a bracket of 
brass from a shore side piling.

out over the deep, blue waters of the Harnen. Two tall pilings 
sit on either side of the dock where it touches the shoreline. 
Two more, taller than the latter sit out at the end of the dock, 
jutting up from the river like pillars against the rivers

the big pilings, act as a rail along the length of the wide dock.

their unmoving foundation.

Harad Road~
   To the north and south the road continues through the plains 
of this land, over hills and down river quiet valleys. The road 
is well defined and mostly made of dirt that has been packed hard 
over the centuries. To all sides of the road the plain continue 
into the distance and to the far east and westward to the great 
sea. By ferry, the Harad Road crosses the Harnen River at 
narrowest point.

Harad Road~
   For endless miles the Harad Road snakes its way over hill and 
valley. This segment of road travels straight for miles on end, 
its unpaved surface hard packed and grooved from use. In every 
direction as far as the eye can see the plains of the south 
continue. Tall grasses bend beneath the ceaseless winds broken 
by light woods and seared patches of ground.

   Boarded on either side by wild fields of golden wheat The 
Harad Road meanders for miles north and south, unbroken by its 
coiling unpaved turns. The wild wheat is dotted by patches of 
barley creating rich fields for grain eating wildlife. To the 
north and south the road stretches on to the horizon.

   The remains of campfires dapple the trampled grasses and hard, 
bare earth of this wide clearing. Deep grooves and ruts scar the 
ground and some broken pottery is crushed into the ground. A 
grove of tall date palms wave in the southern winds indifferent 
to the shelter they offer to weary travelers. The ground is 
soft, its soil rich and fertile. The thin strand of sand at 
waters edge shows heavy use by the caravans that stop here to 
rest. The Haren turns here blocking travel to the east and

small wildlife that hide with its thick, green blanket. The 
tall, grasses ripple in endless waves of green as far as the eye 
can see. A grove of dead trees, bark brittle and grey, the 
chance to discern the species long lost. Wild barley grows in 
small patches from between the thick, wild grasses. The River 
Harnen flows downstream towards the sea, its waters pulling at 
the sandy bank. The Haren turns here blocking travel to the west

parched of the sweet grasses in abundance all around it. 
Waist-length grass of the fertile plains offers the illusion of 
steady footing over the soft earth of this field. The rocky 
surface of the once green plains still support patches of verdant 
green here.

by the restless wind endlessly blowing from the southeast. The 
flat plains of the Near Harad stretch in all directions, verdant 
green but broken by parched, dry grasses and foliage on the far 
horizon. The tall grasses rustle with the movement of the small 
wildlife concealed with its dense green.

   Grassy plains, wild and untamed, stretch in every direction 
bending under the restless, warm southern winds. Ground, dappled 
with grasses, some green, some dried, feels hard underfoot, torn 
by the restless wind endlessly blowing from the southeast. The 
flat plains of the Near Harad stretch in all directions, verdant 
green but broken by parched, dry grasses and foliage on the far 
horizon. The tall grasses rustle with the movement of the small 
wildlife concealed with its dense green. Night cools the 
restless winds of the southern plains.

Fields at River's Edge~
   Sweet grass, soft and tall, ripples as the warm wind sweeps 
across the plains, touching the relentless plains of the 
southland. Stubborn shrubs poke up through hard sandy, ground 
littered with rock. A small grove of wild nut trees, offer 
shelter to thick foliage and small ground dwellers of the planes. 
The tall grasses rustle with the movement of the small wildlife 
concealed with its dense green. The Sheshem Mew laps gently at 
the thin sandy strand at field's edge.

Thin Copse of Tree~
   A thin copse of trees huddle here, inviting the weary traveler 
to rest within its shade and the soft green grasses which crouch 
under their stunted boughs. A stunted cypress tree here, 
malformed by the relentless winds, spreads its branches out to 
offer shade from the harsh southern sky. The tall grasses rustle 
with the movement of the small wildlife concealed with its dense

A Patch of Bare Earth~
   Caressed by the restless southern winds, the undulating wild, 
grasses grow thick and tall, forming a blanket of thick, lush 
green. To the east, a large ravine runs into the ground, forming 
a small canyon of unforgiving, reddish stone. A path has been 
laboriously worked over the grass, showing that the area bears 
traffic from wagons and animals. Access to the canyon is blocked 
by a fortified gate, manned by two watchtowers, where hooded 
sentries hold watch over the plains expanse.

that someone keeps watch over the area. Access to the canyon is 
blocked by a fortified gate, manned by two watchtowers. A pair 
of large torches have been set on iron sconces, offering ample 
light for whomever tends watch here to identify anyone calling on 
the gate.

wagons scar the soft ground crushing the sweet smelling foliage 
in their paths. The swaying green of the tall, plains grasses 
ripple as far as the eye can see in every direction. The tall

knee high to a full grown man covers the ground and offers little 
obstacle to travelers but conceals anything that might make its

chance to discern the species long lost. Wild barley grows in 
small patches from between the thick, wild grasses. The River 
Harnen flows downstream towards the sea. The restless night 
winds of the south blow cool against the tall grasses.

A Dead Riverbed~
   Unbroken on all horizons the plains continue, their tall, wild 
grasses bending to the brush the warm eastern winds. Wild barley 
grows in small patches from between the thick, wild grasses. 
Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and rustle with the small 
wildlife that hide with its thick, green blanket. A clearing in 
the grass, crafted from a water-starved cracking hard, dirt 
ground devoid of any plant life scars the field. A dead riverbed 
fallen in on itself hinders movement north and west.

A Small Grove~
   A small grove of wild nut trees, offer shelter to thick 
foliage and small ground dwellers of the planes. Sweet grass, 
soft and tall, ripples as the warm wind sweeps across the plains, 
touching the relentless plains of the southland. Stubborn shrubs 
poke up through hard sandy, ground littered with rock. The 
swaying green of the tall, plains grasses ripple as far as the 
eye can see in every direction. A sharp drop to the south and 
west into the gorge prevents further travel.

Rippling Waves of Grass~
   Caressed by the restless southern winds, the undulating wild, 
grasses grow thick and tall. The flat grasslands sweep in every 
direction, rippling in green waves beneath the harsh southern 
sky. The swaying green of the tall, plains grasses ripple as far 
as the eye can see in every direction. Insects and birds fill 
the air with a cacophony of song as they hunt for prey or sing to 
their mates. The ground is broken here barring the way west and

by all but boat. The ground breaks into a steep decline creating 
almost a straight drop to the gorge floor below.

Riverbank~

plains continue. The tall, wild grass of the plains retreat 
leaving a waste of dried stalks and bare rock, and unadorned 
plain. The tall grasses rustle with the movement of the small 
wildlife concealed with its dense green. Some tall date palms 
hug the stony riverbank of The Harnen. The plains fade into the

caves in slightly, covered with brush and grass.The sapphire

with its dense green. The restless night winds of the south blow 
cool against the tall grasses.

A Malformed Fig Tree~
   The warm winds bend the tall, thick grasses of the untamed 
plains broken only by stunted trees. A small grove of wild nut 
trees, offer shelter to thick foliage and small ground dwellers 
of the plains An undergrowth, of patchy shrubs accented with 
thick and heavy leaves, huddles beneath a malformed, wild fig 
tree. Grasses tall and wild grow close forming a blanket of 
thick, lush green.

Patchy Undergrowth~
   The flat fertile plains extend in every direction, covered in 
thick grasses which range from two to four feet in height, 
adorned with light woods and barren patches. An undergrowth, of 
patchy shrubs accented with thick and heavy leaves, huddles 
beneath a malformed, wild fig. Birds coo softly as they search 
through the thick foliage underfoot for food.

Amidst Knee High Grasses~
   The harsh sky of the south beats down on the plains with 
unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from the 
southeast. Knee high grasses sway beneath the steady, hot winds 
of the southlands. Sweet smelling foliage, knee high to a full 
grown man covers the ground and offers little obstacle to 
travelers but conceals anything that might make its way upon the 
ground. A small rise, set against an incline above halts passage 
in its direction but offers shelter from the often harsh winds.

The Meandering Harad Road~
   Deep ruts make travel difficult over this stretch of the way. 
The Harad Road meanders along far to the south and east far into 
the distance, passing fertile fields and semi-arid plains, along 
its long trek across country. A large piece of the hard packed 
dirt is missing to the west making travel difficult in that 
direction. To the east the plains continue as far as the eye can 
see.

A Snaking Turn in The Road~
   This segment of road stretches far into northern and eastern 
distance. The road is unpaved and rutted by the countless wheels 
of wagons journeying the way over the hills and valleys crossed 
by the ancient highway. To the south fields stretch to The 
Harnen broken only by light patches of wood or wind seared 
ground. In the west the fields span to the Bay of Belfalas.

   The ancient dirt trail that is Harad Road winds its way 
through The Near Harad, endlessly north and south and bordering 
Harondor to the near west, through the valleys and flatlands of 
the south and The Shadow Mountains to the far east. Over rivers 
and hills, the way tirelessly snakes its way across country.

within the tall, wild grasses of the fertile plains. Sweet

the long Harad road continues its endless journey. To the east 
and south lay the lands of the Haradrim, to the west in the near 
distance lay Harondor, the lands bitterly contested by Gondor 
south of the Poros. Mordor looms ever closer on the Eastern 
Horizon.

that wall in Mordor. The sea plains to the west spans to The Bay

   The harsh sky of the south beats down on the plains with 
unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from the 
southeast. Stubborn shrubs poke up through hard sandy, ground 
littered with rock. Dried grasses crackle underfoot, as a wind 
seared scar of ground scrapes its way through the lush green of

   The harsh sky of the south beats down on the plains with 
unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from the 
southeast. Stubborn shrubs poke up through hard sandy, ground 
littered with rock. Dried grasses crackle underfoot, as a wind 
seared scar of ground scrapes its way through the lush green of 
the thick, wild grasses. A small circle of rocks and burned 
ground mar the quiet beauty of the field. The restless night 
winds of the south blow cool against the tall grasses.

Tall Grasses~
   Waist-length grass of the fertile plains offers the illusion 
of steady footing over the soft earth of this field. The flat 
plains of the Near Harad stretch in all directions, verdant green 
but broken by parched, dry grasses and foliage on the far 
horizon. The call of a large animal carries on the relentless 
wind as it journey over the fertile plains of the south lands. 
To the plains continue to the western horizon and The Bay of 
Belfalas beyond.

A Grove of Dead Trees~
   In all directions the plains continue, the lush green broken 
by the occasional hard, stretch of ground. Waist-length grass of 
the fertile plains offers the illusion of steady footing over the 
soft earth of this field. A grove of dead trees, bark brittle 
and grey, the chance to discern the species long lost. The rocky 
surface of the once green plains still support patches of verdant 
green here.

Some Stunted Tress~
   A small grove of stunted trees offers shelter from the harsh 
southern sky as the plains spread out in all directions. Wild 
barley grows thick within the tall, wild grasses of the fertile 
plains. Crushed grasses and muddy patches of silt encircle a 
small seep of fresh water. The warm climate here offers a rich 
environment for large and small animals, birds and a myriad 
insects to make their homes.

The Harad Road Snakes Along~
   The road runs turns here here north and east, stretching its 
unpaved ribbon for miles in either direction. Crossing valleys 
and rivers, mountains and borders, the long Harad road continues 
its endless journey. To the south lay the lands of the Haradrim, 
and also to the west the Haradrim lands reach beyond the distant 
horizon to the bay. To the north the plains of the Near Harad 
bend to the caress of the warm winds all the way to the Poros 
River.

Harad leading on further to the rain forests of the far south. 
Westward are the lands the plains stretch to the sea. The way

its rough rutted surface unforgiving in its length. From the 
southlands it crosses the Poros river in the far north and 
eastward are the flat plains rolling towards the dark mountains 
that wall in Mordor. The sea plains to the west span to The Bay

Long Winding Road~
   The road reaches towards the horizon, unbroken in its twisting 
stubborn path. Travel is easier as the way is smooth and hard as 
it snakes east and south. North lay the vast plains of the Near 
Harad leading on further to the rain forests of the far south. 
Westward are the lands coveted by Gondor below the Poros, and to 
the east Mordor looms ever closer across the verdant plains of 
the Near Harad.

Hard Packed Roadway~
   Patches of light woods dot the plains in all directions as far 
as the eye can see. To the east in the far distance, beyond the 
horizon loom the dark mountains bordering Mordor. Westward lay 
the border to Harondor. Conditions on this long winding stretch 
of highway vary from smooth hard packed dirt to crumbling, 
parched earth. The way continues east and west.

Meandering Rutted Roadway~
   Hard packed dirt rutted and grooved by wagons and cart, make 
footing difficult here long this segment of the way. The 
occasional patch of grass grows across the road. The road at 
times becomes almost undistinguishable from the roadsides. For 
endless miles upon miles the road stretches into the distance. 
To the horizon in the south and to the Poros in the north the 
rambling road ceaseless in its long journey.

Before a Fortified Bridge~
   To the north lies the wide stone bridge across the Poros 
River, leading to the lands of Gondor and beyond. To the south 
the Haradwait expands its far reaching plains to the sea and rain 
forests and desert wastes. The swift waters flow from east to 
west acting as the natural border between countries. A stone 
guard house keeps vigil here. 
   A heavy iron gate bars the width of the bridge to the north.

A Fortified Gated Bridge~
   A round stone guard house sits on the south end of this 
fortified bridge. Spanning the Poros, its wide expanse is 
crafted from native stone. Tall wooden rails line either side 
held tightly in place by heavy, hemp ropes. The deck and pilings 
are stone, and the swift waters of the Poros ceaselessly laps at 
their footings. The bridge is well maintained and free of 
debris. A heavy iron gate spans width of the bridge.

Unending Plains~
   Stretching to The Bay of Belfalas and caressed by the restless 
southern winds, the undulating wild, grasses grow thick and tall. 
The flat grasslands sweep in every direction, rippling in green 
waves beneath the harsh southern sky. The swaying green of the 
tall, plains grasses ripple as far as the eye can see in every 
direction. The vast sea plain fades into the western horizon.

Wild Grasses~
   Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and rustle with the 
small wildlife that hide with its thick, green blanket. Stubborn 
shrubs poke up through hard sandy, ground littered with rock. 
Bare ground, hard and sandy, scored by the relentless winds break

broken only by stunted trees. The grassy plains fade off into

here. The tall, grasses ripple in endless waves of green as far 
as the eye can see. Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and 
rustle with the small wildlife that hide with its thick, green 
blanket. A bird of prey circles nearby before soaring upwards 
his curiosity sated. Night descends bringing cooling relief from 
the heat of the southern day.

A Muddy Creek~
   From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Near Harad is offered to the eye. Sweet smelling foliage, 
knee high to a full grown man covers the ground and offers little 
obstacle to travelers but conceals anything that might make its 
way upon the ground. A shallow, muddy bottomed creek is hidden 
amongst seemingly endless plains.

Patchy Undergrowth~
   The harsh sky of the south beats down on the plains with 
unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from the 
southeast. An undergrowth, of patchy shrubs accented with thick 
and heavy leaves, huddles beneath a malformed, wild fig tree. 
The tall grasses rustle with the movement of the small wildlife 
concealed with its dense green.

A Small Seep~
   The sweet smell of the dense ground cover wafts up as it 
disturbed by the wind and small mammals scurrying within the knee 
high foliage. An excellent view of the countryside of the Near 
Harad is offered from this vantage point, the fertile plains 
present in all directions. A small seep forms a muddy puddle of 
fresh water, offering its cool, refreshment to predators and prey 
alike.

parched of the sweet grasses in abundance all around it. 
Waist-length grass of the fertile plains offers the illusion of 
steady footing over the soft earth of this field.

   A small hill, surrounded by flat ground looks over the land as 
far as the eye can see offering a view over the land as it 
descends from fertile plains to arid desert. Grassy plains, wild 
and untamed, stretch in every direction bending under the 
restless, warm southern winds. The tall grasses rustle with the 
movement of the small wildlife concealed with its dense green. 
The black, velvet of night blankets the south.

Knee High Grasses~
   In the distance the heat shimmers across the green fields of 
the plains, unscarred by barren, patches of hard earth. Deep 
ruts from carts and wagons scar the soft ground crushing the 
sweet smelling foliage in their paths. Wild grasses grow tall as 
a man's knee and rustle with the small wildlife that hide with 
its thick, green blanket.

A Muddy Patch of Ground~
   Crushed grasses and muddy patches of silt encircle a small 
seep of fresh water. A small grove of wild nut trees, offer 
shelter to thick foliage and small ground dwellers of the plains. 
Caressed by the restless southern winds, the undulating wild, 
grasses grow thick and tall. The swaying green of the tall, 
plains grasses ripple as far as the eye can see in every

Patchy Shrubs~
   An undergrowth, of patchy shrubs accented with thick and heavy

plains extend in every direction, covered in thick grasses which 
range from two to four feet in height, adorned with tilled and 
fallow fields. Birds coo softly as they search through the thick 
foliage underfoot for food.

unrelenting warmth, accompanied by the tireless winds from the

A Stunted Tree~
   A thin copse of trees huddle here, inviting the weary traveler 
to rest within its shade and the soft green grasses which crouch 
under their stunted boughs. A shallow, muddy bottomed creek is 
hidden amongst seemingly endless plains. A stunted cypress tree 
here, malformed by the relentless winds, spreads its branches out 
to offer shade from the harsh southern sky.

Southern Bank of The Poros~
   The swift moving current, cold waters cold, of The River Poros 
flows from east to west here. Its blue waters lap at the muddy 
bank as a fish splashes across its surface. A small copse of 
trees grow near the bank. To the north the mountains loom in the 
far distance. To the south the flat plains of the Haradwaith 
stretch beyond the horizon.

Rocky Bank of The Poros~
   The muddy river bank is stony here. Rocks worn smooth by the 
waters touch litter the muddy riverside hindering solid footing. 
Tall grasses grow almost to the edge of The Poros River as it 
flows swiftly from east to west. Southward the plains stretch 
out to the horizon and to the north lay South Ithilien, the fast 
moving ribbon of blue water its border with the Haradwaith.

Windswept Grasses~
   Grassy plains, wild and untamed, stretch in every direction 
bending under the restless, warm southern winds. The flat plains 
of the Near Harad stretch in all directions, verdant green but 
broken by parched, dry grasses and foliage on the far horizon. 
The tall grasses rustle with the movement of the small wildlife 
concealed with its dense green.

   Unbroken on all horizons the plains continue, their tall, wild 
grasses bending to the brush the warm eastern winds. Wild barley 
grows in small patches from between the thick, wild grasses. The 
wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and rustle with the small 
wildlife that hide with its thick, green blanket. A clearing in

direction. Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and rustle 
with the small wildlife that hide with its thick, green blanket. 
A shallow, muddy bottomed creek is hidden amongst seemingly 
endless plains. Beyond the horizon across the vast plains to the 
north east looms Mordor crounching behind the tall dark mountains 
and the east is the land of Khand.

Fertile Plains~
   Untamed the fertile plains of the Near Harad can be seen in 
every direction intermittently dotted with areas parched of the 
sweet grasses in abundance all around it. The swaying green of 
the tall, plains grasses ripple as far as the eye can see in 
every direction. A flock of long-necked birds fly in formation 
towards the sea in the west.

A Barren Patch of Ground~
   A barren patch of earth mars its beauty. A small circle of 
rocks and burned ground mar the quiet beauty of the field. The 
tall, wild grass of the plains retreat leaving a waste of dried 
stalks and bare rock, and unadorned plain. The tall grasses 
rustle with the movement of the small wildlife concealed with its 
dense green. The soft loam offers homes to small ground dwelling 
animals.

   Wheat, golden and wild, grows untamed throughout the verdant 
field underfoot. A shallow, muddy bottomed creek is hidden 
amongst seemingly endless plains. Stubborn shrubs poke up 
through hard sandy, ground littered with rock. A small grove of 
wild nut trees, offer shelter to thick foliage and small ground 
dwellers of the plains. The black, velvet of night blankets the 
south.

A Depression in The Flat Plains~
The ground breaks here, falling sharply into a tiny 
depression, home to a small pool of fresh water. In all 
directions the plains continue, the lush green broken by the 
occasional hard, stretch of ground. The flat plains of the Near 
Harad stretch in all directions, verdant green but broken by 
parched, dry grasses and foliage on the far horizon.

Some Stunted Trees~
   A stunted cypress tree here, malformed by the relentless 
winds, spreads its branches out to offer shade from the harsh 
southern sky. A thin copse of trees huddle here, inviting the 
weary traveler to rest within its shade and the soft green 
grasses which crouch under their stunted boughs. The tall 
grasses rustle with the movement of the small wildlife concealed

A Hard Dirt Clearing~
   A clearing in the grass, crafted from a water-starved cracking 
hard, dirt ground devoid of any plant life scars the field. 
Unbroken on all horizons the plains continue, their tall, wild 
grasses bending to the brush the warm eastern winds. Wild barley 
grows in small patches from between the thick, wild grasses. 
Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and rustle with the small 
wildlife that hide with its thick, green blanket.

Tall Wind Blown Grasses~
   Sweet grass, soft and tall, ripples as the warm wind sweeps 
across the plains, touching the relentless plains of the 
southland. Stubborn shrubs poke up through hard sandy, ground 
littered with rock. A bird of prey circles nearby before soaring 
upwards his curiosity sated. A small cliff, set against a

   The tall, grasses ripple in endless waves of green as far as 
the eye can see. Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and 
rustle with the small wildlife that hide with its thick, green 
blanket. A grove of dead trees, bark brittle and grey, the 
chance to discern the species long lost. A bird of prey circles 
nearby before soaring upwards his curiosity sated. What seems to 
have been a farmstead has been burned and abandoned nearby, the 
buildings weathered but sporting some new work. A plume of smoke 
raises from a fire set in the middle of the stead, apparently 
some cooking fire.

Amidst Wild Wheat Fields~
   Wheat, golden and wild, grows untamed throughout the verdant 
field underfoot. A small rise, set against an incline above 
halts passage in its direction but offers shelter from the often 
harsh winds. The swaying green of the tall, plains grasses 
ripple as far as the eye can see in every direction. A flock of 
long-necked birds fly in formation towards the sea in the west.

A Forgotten Campsite~
   A small circle of rocks and burned ground mar the quiet beauty 
of the field. A barren patch of earth mars its beauty. The 
tall, wild grass of the plains retreat leaving a waste of dried 
stalks and bare rock, and unadorned plain. The swaying grasses 
rustle with the movement of the small wildlife concealed with its 
dense green.

A Copse of Trees~
   A thin copse of trees huddle here, inviting the weary traveler 
to rest within its shade and the soft green grasses which crouch 
under their stunted boughs. An undergrowth, of patchy shrubs 
accented with thick and heavy leaves, huddles beneath a 
malformed, wild fig tree. A clearing in the grass, crafted from 
a water-starved cracking hard, dirt ground devoid of any plant 
life scars the field.

Grassy Plains~
   A large ravine yawns in the eastern distance. Swaying beneath 
the hot winds of the south the long grasses bend beneath its 
touch. The ground is soft near the lip of the cliff and slightly 
unstable. Small animals scurrying about causing a rustle in the 
tall grass. A gnarled old fig tree spreads its boughs offering 
meager shade a short distance from the edge. The ground below is 
rugged and littered with trees.

sway with tall grasses, wild wheat and barley. Crushed grasses 
and muddy patches of silt encircle a small seep of fresh water. 
The black, velvet of night blankets the south.

Wind Swept Plains~
   Stretching to the western cost to the mountains in the 
northeast to the unbroken southern reaches of the Haradwaith, the 
plains continue. Waist-length grass of the fertile plains offers 
the illusion of steady footing over the soft earth of this field. 
A barren patch of earth mars its beauty. The warm winds bend the 
tall, thick grasses of the untamed plains broken only by stunted 
trees.

Flat Verdant Plains~
   Flat and green the plains spread out in a seamless never 
ending stretch in all directions, with only stunted trees to 
break on the horizon. Wild grasses grow tall as a man's knee and 
rustle with the small wildlife that hide with its thick, green 
blanket. A small grove of wild nut trees, offer shelter to thick 
foliage and small ground dwellers of the plains.

Wind Torn Plains~
   The rocky surface of the once green plains still support 
patches of verdant green here. Stretching to the western cost to 
the mountains in the northeast to the unbroken southern reaches 
of the Haradwaith, the plains continue. The flat grasslands 
sweep in every direction, rippling in green waves beneath the

Vast Fertile Plains~
   Verdant fields lay thick with foliage, its earthy aroma

rest within its shade and the soft green grasses which crouch 
under their stunted boughs. Waist-length grass of the fertile 
plains offers the illusion of steady footing over the soft earth 
of this field. The darkness of the night bring blankets the land 
with cooling winds.

Vast Verdant Fields~
   Untamed the fertile plains of the Near Harad can be seen in 
every direction intermittently dotted with areas parched of the 
sweet grasses in abundance all around it. Ground, dappled with 
grasses, some green, some dried, feels hard underfoot, torn by 
the restless wind endlessly blowing from the southeast. The flat 
plains of the Near Harad stretch in all directions, verdant green 
but broken by parched, dry grasses and foliage on the far 
horizon.

Broad Plains of Grass~
   Vast fertile plains stretch to the east while the horizon 
stretches in all directions. The broad fields of the Near Harad 
are wild and overgrown here. Wild grasses grow tall as a man's 
knee and rustle with the small wildlife that hide with its thick, 
green blanket. Stubborn shrubs poke up through hard sandy, 
ground littered with rock. A flock of long-necked birds fly in 
formation towards the sea in the west.

   A sharp decline, set against a rise halts passage in its

Unbroken on all horizons the plains continue, their tall, wild

green the plains spread out in a seamless never ending stretch in 
all directions, with only stunted trees to break on the horizon. 
A clearing in the grass, crafted from a water-starved cracking

as it howls across the valleys and hillocks of the desert. The 
dunes tower over head, like the endless waves in an ocean, ever 
changing with the wind. The horizon seems to shift as the 
searing winds rip at the sand with constant force. The 
desertscape of wind sculpted dunes continues in all directions. 
Night winds cool the land after the heat of the day.

Amidst The Changing Plains~
   An undergrowth, of patchy shrubs accented with thick and heavy 
leaves, huddles beneath a malformed, wild fig tree. The warm 
winds bend the tall, thick grasses of the untamed plains broken 
only by stunted trees. The swaying green of the tall, plains 
grasses ripple as far as the eye can see in every direction. 
From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of the 
Near Harad is offered to the eye.

A Sharp Drop~
   Caressed by the restless southern winds, the undulating wild, 
grasses grow thick and tall. Grasses tall and wild grow close 
forming a blanket of thick, lush green. Wild grasses grow tall 
as a man's knee and rustle with the small wildlife that hide with 
its thick, green blanket. To the east travel is halted by a 
sharp drop to a dead riverbed fallen in on itself.

Top of the Treacherous Path~
   The thin, gravel-covered surface of the path crunches at any 
traffic, making a silent approach impossible. Wide enough for a 
mid-sized wagon to traverse its diagonal, lowering length, it 
takes skill for a rider to cross under anything by ideal 
conditions, due to the slippery quality of the gravel and rutted 
condition of the carpet. Carved at a break-neck angle, it takes 
great effort to climb back and much care to advance down into the 
depths of the ravine.

Base of the Treacherous Path~
   The treacherous length of the ravine's path comes to an end in 
the base of the small canyon, where it opens to the east and 
north. The reverberating echoes of the area are full with the 
sounds of work, apparently coming from the north. The 
gravel-covered path gives way to the solid floor of the ravine, 
permitting quick and easy travel towards the area from where the 
sounds come.

Entrance of the Ravine~
   The narrow part of the ravine begins here, nearby a 
treacherous path that sneaks upward to the lip of the canyon. 
The ground is composed mostly of solid stone, with sand and 
sparse shrubbery spread on the small cracks of the carpet. To 
the north, what would be a few city blocks separate this area 
from what seems to be some sort of mining operation, set on the 
other end of the ravine.

Shepherd's Shack~
   A narrow planked door sports a sturdy lock. A tiny hearth is 
set in one wall. A pillow and low table are set before scorched 
bricks and a narrow sleeping area lays close beside it for warmth 
in the cool southern nights. The ceiling is clay and a tiny 
brass lantern swings gently from the rafters throwing uneven 
light across the room. This small but cosy, white adobe building 
has windows in every wall.

Lush Pastures~
   The fertile plains and pastures continue here with adobe farms 
dotting the landscape, their inhabitants busy with the long day's 
work. Verdant fields grow bountiful crops in this area of the 
Near Harad. A small grove of figs are neatly planed here, while 
other fields lay fallow to rest. The tall grasses rustle with 
the movement of the small wildlife concealed with its dense green 
embrace. Verdant fields grow bountiful crops in this area of the 
Near Harad. 
  A small adobe house sits amidst the pastures.

Amidst Wide Pastures~
   Flocks of sheep, tended by robed shepherds roam and graze 
contentedly on the tall, wild grasses of these untilled fields. 
The soft braying accompanies the caw of birds from above as they 
swoop down on their prey hidden in the thick, green foliage as 
tall as a man's knee. The fields here are lightly dappled with 
trees bordering the fields stretching northward. The fertile 
plains and pastures continue here with adobe farms dotting the

directions. Soft grasses grow thick where the earth isnt freshly 
torn from wheels and hooves and footprints. The rutted and

long and wide adobe building its walls brown with age. Torches 
on long poles line the way to the various buildings and tents. 
To the south the yard continues.

   Vast, green pastures spread in every direction. Grasses grow 
knee high to a man while all manner of live stock graze in the 
pastures. Horses, the famed Kramatian's graze in their expansive 
acres and acres of lush, fenced grasslands. Cattle and dairy 
cows graze lazily in an expansive pasture fenced by waist high 
thick shrubs. Sheep dot a wide, far meadow bordered with heavy 
shrubs and a few stunted trees. A narrow dusty pathway leads 
towards a long, low adobe building with a clay tiled roof. A 
large chicken coop and hen house sits adjacent to the building. 
One could 'leave pasture' to walk away from this area.

Approaching the Mining Operation~
   The solid stone floor bears the marks of constant traffic by 
wheel and hoof, which have delineated a straight path from the 
entrance to the ravine. No more than a stone throw to the north, 
the gaping entrance to a mine opens on the side of the canyon 
wall. Men can be seen coming from the mine, pushing wooden carts 
full of ores, while others unload and separate the bounty from 
the earth in piles. A strong smell of burning wafts in the area, 
although the origin is not evident from this position.

The Mining Operation, by the Mines Entrance~
   The ravine comes to an end here, giving way to a large, gaping 
entrance into what seems to be a subterranean mine. Men and 
women can be seen milling around, whether hauling ore loads from 
carts brought to the mines entrance or taking the loads to the 
west where a large smelting furnace can be seen, spewing forth a 
long plume of dark smoke into the sky. A small building has been 
set near the entrance, apparently some sort of office, while a 
sprawling barrack takes one city block to the east. It is 
possible to get closer to the smelting operation to the west, 
enter the mine shaft to the north or return to the ravine to the 
south.

   The ravine comes to an end here, giving way to a large, gaping 
entrance into what seems to be a subterranean mine. Although 
seemingly deserted, large torches have been set by the entrance 
to the shaft, and to the west, the glow of a huge smelting 
furnace pouring ores illuminates the night. A small building has 
been set near the entrance, looking empty and dark, while some 
sort of sprawling barrack takes one city block to the east, light 
coming from some of the windows. It is possible to get closer to 
the smelting operation to the west, enter the mine shaft to the 
north or return to the ravine to the south.

A Small Adobe Cabin~
   This small adobe room has one shuttered window for 
ventilation. The thick mud walls brown with age and unadorned 
protect the room from the heat of the day. A single lantern 
dangles from the rafters throwing oily light across the room. 
The floor is dull clay tile. A thick wood door with a sturdy 
lock is set into the southern wall. The room is devoid of 
furniture or comforts. The caving of a large lion is above the 
doorway.

Aboard a Narrow Cutter~
   The deck of this 35 foot long ship is grimy with tar, dirt and 
other indescribable substances, with crates piled up about the 
base of the mast and in the hull of the vessel. A long spar 
extends forth off the bow of the ship, with a line connecting it 
to the tip of the mast, a scarlet-striped foresail fluttering in 
the breeze off this line. The ship has two other sails, 
similarily striped, the main sail billowing off the mast and a 
smaller sail atop that, held taught in the wind. The cladding of 
the ship is flush, rather than the traditional overlapping bands 
and appears to be made of fir-wood. All these points of design 
seem to indicate this ship was made for speed, with no frills. 
   The ship has been docked along the Poros River.

On the Rickety Dock.~
   Wide enough for four men to walk abreast this dock appears to 
be rickety at best. The timber used as flooring juts up at odd 
angles every now and then and occasionally there is a board 
missing altogether. Waves lap at the ten metre length of the 
dock, spraying water across its surface, making for potentially 
hazardous footing. Large, iron mooring-blocks are present on 
either side of the dock and thick timber poles hold the pier 
easily out of the water.

A Narrow Cutter Moving Down the Poros~
   The scarlet-striped sails of this ship are full of wind as you 
progress down the Poros, the Harad wilderness passing by to the 
south as you watch the imposing figure of the Mountains of Shadow 
fade behind you. The ship tacks every now and then, keeping the 
wind behind it and avoiding the occasional rock jutting from the 
water's surface, whitewash breaking about these dangerous points. 
Men scurry about on deck, manning the sails and keeping all lines 
tight.

atecho (81666) The captain steers the ship with obvious skill, the water calm and easy and he moves the speedy vessel through its surface.

A lone man at the bow of the ship keeps careful watch over the upcoming waters, an arm often raised and pointed at obstacles for the captain to beware of.

atecho (81666) The captain suddenly shouts to the bowman, who had apparently fallen asleep, and pulls hard on the tiller sending the ship into a rough tack. The sails loose all wind as the vessel turns almost the whole way to starboard, crates and men both send sprawling toward the rail of the ship. With the captain still cursing the ship is turned straight again, with the bowman now awake and quivering. Looking over the side of the boat you see a large, pointed rock just below the surface of the water, not more than four foot away from the ship's hull.

Despite the now complete lack of sandbars and rocks the bowman still keeps his eyes peeled across the water, even declining to be replaced as the rest of the men change shift. The night sky above shows a collage of beautiful stars, which the captain persistantly keeps checking, with barely enough light to see a shore in either direction.

atecho (81666) The captain announces it's not far to the Anduin now and a quiet cheer is heard from the crew. The scarlet striped sails remain full and the men are constantly drawing in and letting out the lines as the captain tacks across the light waves. The boom of the main sail swings back and forth as this happens and all the crew duck subconsciously as this happens, despite their being a decent enough clearance to make the tallest of Haradun safe from the huge piece of timber. The current seems to pick up as the vessel nears the Anduin, and the boat becomes quicker, with a salty air blowing about the hair of all those onboard.

   The cutter now moves up the Anduin, sails still full of wind 
as the Captain tacks diagonally across the water. The South 
Ithilien passes on the Eastern side and you are able to catch 
glimpses of South Gondor as the ship tacks to the port side. Men 
scurry about silently as they constantly tighten and loosen 
lines, forever keeping watch on the surrounding waters.

Coming closer now to the pillar the captain continues to grin and it is only as you draw past the pillar you realise why; it's not a pillar at all but a huge portion of cliff, broken away. The waves lap on the stone noisily as the captain cautiously moves further to port, avoiding any hidden dangers below.

atecho (81667) The voyage upriver goes slowly, the captain having to tack often to catch the wind and beat the current. The river curves slightly but given the vessel's speed, or lackthereof, it's hardly noticeable. The scenery barely changes on the Eastern side, the Harathilien planes only broken by the occasional tree, mere specks in the distance. When you do get a chance to view the Western side of the Anduin it is much the same. The crew have gone quiet, their attempts at breaking the monotony with songs proven futile many hours ago.

atecho (81667) The plains continue to roll by the Eastern side unchanging but always moving as the cutter does its best to make speed across the waves and against the current. Water sprays in over the bow constantly, the bowman soaked head to toe. The grimy deck now glistens with water and it becomes hazardous to walk more than a few cautious steps at a time. Marines do their best to get from one side of the boat to the other as they continue to keep all lines tight and the sails full. The swinging of the boom overhead is now a constant factor, its rythm creating a cadence for the journey as the ship tacks, back and forth, through the water.

atecho (81667) The first-mate of the ship makes his way to the tiller, relieving the captain of a long shift. The captain turns, his face drawn and tired and announces that the fields passing the Eastern side are now those of the Southern Ithilien. Looking Eastward you barely notice a change, bar a large tributary coming off of the Anduin. The captain retires to his quarters in the bow of the ship as the first-mate effortlessly takes up his position, looking to the stars and adjusting course. The rest of the crew continue with there work though their spirits seem low, working monotonously as the boom of the main sail continues to beat the cadence over their heads.

atecho (81667) Passing another large tributary it seems the monotony of the Eastern plains will never end, the occasional group of trees or small inlet being the only change. The sails begins to luff as the wind dies down but a quick tack from the first-mate to starboard brings them back to their full glory and the cutter continues on, most of the crew yawning as they loosen the lines on the starboard side as their port-side counterparts do the opposite. No-one seems to care for the crates shifting about in the hull and on deck anymore and the bowman, still their from the Poros, finally changes shift with another member of the crew, curling up on a sodden straw mat near where he previously stood.

atecho (81667) As the deckhand continues to sleep the men still working the lines and sails begin to smile as though as one, looking overboard and to the Eastern shore you see why, the monotony of the plains begins to change, first with just an occasional rise and then come more. Hills begin to rise out of the plains and the cutter's speed makes the transition even more dramatic. The Emyn Arnen Hills are now visible and the first-mate turns about, confirming not only this but also the close proximity of Osgiliath, provided there's no trouble coming into port.

A Narrow Cutter Moving Up The Poros~
   The scarlet striped sails of this ship are full of wind as you 
progress up the Poros, the Harad wilderness passing by to the 
South as you watch the imposing figure of the Mountains of Shadow 
near. The Ship tacks constantly as it struggles upriver, 
avoiding the occasional rock jutting from the water's surface, 
whitewash breaking about these dangerous points. Men scurry 
about on deck, manning the sails and keeping all lines tight.

The crew start cheering long enough to haul in the lines, swinging the boom the rest of the way overhead and filling the sail once more. With the sails now tight the captain steers the cutter cautiously up-current.

The bowman straightens his posture, holding onto the long prow of the ship for balance as he points out a rock, barely visible, up ahead. The captain gives him a single nod as he tacks to avoid it, the crew members pulling or releasing rope as necessary to circumvent the rock which almost ended the journey on the way to Osgiliath.

Valley of The Dead~
   A wide valley opens as the narrow rutted path continues. The 
valley descends on a shallow incline. Its scrub lined walls rise 
upwards and stretch eastwards to come to halt at tall rock wall 
in the distance. Two massive iron gates bar the way guarded on 
either side by statues of fierce men with arcing scimitars 
standing silent sentinel on their quiet charge.

Heavy sand stone slabs etched sigils, animals and family markings

the valley and across the tombs. The narrow path continues in

abandoned and set to the torch some years ago. New inhabitants 
have moved in, setting some reinforcing of the nearby structures 
and setting them up to properly resist an assault if such thing 
was to pass. The windows have been worked with tough wooden 
shutters and murderholes and the doors seem strong to resist a 
decided hacking. In the middle of the yard stands a large 
firepit. A large #3home#0 stands east, and a small #3building#0

   This large building has had all its inner, dividing walls 
removed, be it by the fire that gutted it or the repairs taken to 
it. Mostly kept ordered, it is evident this place is one where a 
large number of men gather to sleep and possibly socialize, 
indication given by the cots and mats set around, as well as some 
cooking implements and rickety tables. To the west, into the 
yard, what was a large window has been shuttered and worked with 
long, rectangular murder holes so an archer enjoys total 
protection to loose into any assaulter.

white-faced warrior to name but a few. A large sand-stone dais 
sits against the southern wall, its many grains patterning the

   Dank, moist air flows through the large space here, nearly 
suffocating with the scent of mold and staleness. Nearly the 
entire bottom of this old, stone tunnel is covered in a thin 
puddle, the murky water fluttering with debris and small insects. 
Cobwebs are anything but scarce along the stone, cracked walls of 
this dark hole, faint sounds of water and creatures echoing 
throughout the hollowness. A rusted ladder leads upwards on the 
northern wall into the darkness. The tunnel expands southward, 
any sort of light quickly eaten up by the darkness ahead.

indicating their presence. The air is dank and smells of 
stagnant water, vermin and dust swilling about the small tunnel 
in an obnoxious combination. Debris falls from above in small 
amounts, splashing to the small puddles below, the noise echoing 
from wall to wall. The tunnel runs to the north and south, any 
sort of light disappearing quickly in the darkness ahead.

other debris line the walkway in random places, roots coming 
through cracks in the walls and roof, sounds of the earth above

grassy plains that extend as far as the eye can see on either 
bank. Save for the occasional ship that may pas this way, the 
waters appear calm, dotted here and there with lily pads, though 
the occasional drag marks visible on the sandy banks would imply 
that this river may be home to more than fish. The fronds of the 
willow trees that grow near the bank descend into the waters 
themselves, trailing along with the lazy current, while the 
breeze in their higher brances creates a low, but constant 
rustling noise. To the east, the river runs straight for a good 
distance, while to the west it appears to bend round a slight 
fold in the landscape as it approaches the walls of Fahad Jafari.

   The waters of the Sheshem Mew look inky black in the southern 
night as they meander lazily through the grassy plains of Near 
Harad. Save for the occasional ship that may pass this way, the 
waters appear still, the flowers of the numerous waterlilies that 
dot the surface of the river closing for the night. The rustling 
of the breeze in the willow trees that grow on the banks is only 
punctuated by the far-off roar of the occasional, distant lion.

and murky water. The pungent smell of death and animal droppings 
is near sickening, and on the naturally formed walls are narrow, 
twisting passageways leading in every direction. Debris and 
fallen rocks are strewn about the large expanse, the 
reverberating sound of vermin and insects barely heard over the 
thundering river above.

stand-still, albeit slowly moving northward. The tunnel ceiling 
is not very tall, and one of average height could probably touch 
it with a hand. Jagged rocks plunge from the walls, mold and 
fungi of all sorts covering them. The pungent smell is less 
sickening than the expanse to the south, and the passageway 
continues on to the north.

A Narrow Cave~
   The passageway narrows here, the jagged walls plunging out 
towards each other, allowing barely a full-sized human being to 
pass through with ease. Up above, pillars of rocks plunge down 
from the top of the cave, a few crystals glistening through the 
stone. The water remains ankle-high, the insects floating about 
no less now than before. Spiderwebs touch from jagged rock to 
jagged rock, lining the walls and ceiling. The narrow 
passageways leads to the north and south, it getting wider in 
both directions.

Collapsed Cave~
   The jagged rocks and ceiling branch off slightly, allowing a 
larger passageway into the cave. Large boulders block the 
northward passage, collapsed some time ago. Rushing water can be 
heard from above, and small droplets of water leak through 
cracks, adding to the slow-moving current of water. The water 
gradually slides through the northern boulders, many dead rats 
and insects piling up against the rocks. A large spider web is 
hanging from above, connected by two jagged rocks.

A Narrow Cave~
   Shrouded in perpetual darkness this narrow tunnel beneath the 
Harnen is several inches deep in filthy water. The sound in this 
place is overwhelming, the muffled roar of the swiftly flowing 
river is nearly drowned out at times by the constant, percussive 
sound of the water that drips from the ceiling. The place is 
filled with the stench of rot, and bones and corpses in various 
states of decay float in the water underfoot, bloated beyond all 
recognition. Amongst the din, the constant buzzing of flies can 
be heard, and the myriad cobwebs that hang from every available 
outcropping of rock as well as the chittering and scurrying 
noises of rats, give evidence to the other fauna of this place.

A Shadowy Channel~
   Extending from the massive cavern to the west, this channel is 
large enough for several people to walk through. The rock floor 
is uneven, but steady, moldy water clinging to it's surface and 
dripping down the jagged walls. From the rock ceiling, hang 
large crystallite formations, the gleaming rocks glistening at 
the hint of any available light. Dead rodents, insects, and 
spiders line the floors, and the stench is no less worse than in 
the main expanse. The channel moves eastward, or back to the 
cavern westward.

Twisted Passageway~
   The floor of this twisting passageway beneath the Harnen is 
uneven and extremely slippery. Flooded several inches deep in 
filthy water, the sound of the river rushing by overhead is 
nearly deafening, though the constant buzzing of the insects 
which feast upon the many bloated corpses which float upon the 
water is still more insistant. Spiderwebs hang thickly from the 
ceiling above, making passage through this slippery tunnel 
difficult, while a veritable horde of rats and their droppings 
crowd the floor below.

   The slippery, uneven floor of the tunnel ends here as the 
floor suddenly drops away underfoot into a wide pit. The edge is 
extemely slick and balance is hard to find as the water that 
floods the rest of this cavern constantly plummets over the edge 
with a near deafening roar. A constant mist of water hangs in 
the air here and the entire area reeks of death and decay. The 
pit itself seems rather deep, the destination of the water that 
floods into that black abyss consumed by the surrounding 
darkness.

   This pit is filled with dark, debris-ridden water, bloated

narrow crevice in the jagged, stone pit walls you can see the 
water leading out to somewhere. The pit is deep, and offers no 
safe-dwelling from the horrid water except upwards from whence 
you came. Sharp, jagged rocks protrude from the walls of the 
pit, making the pit difficult to maneuver about in.

more rotting and bloated corpses of small animals lining the 
rocky floor. The floor slopes down into a slippery shaft, but 
one could easily make it down safely whilst holding onto the 
protruding rocks from the narrowing walls. Water drips down from

   To the east and west of this narrow walkway, the cave floor 
has crumbled down into a black abyss. The walkway offers little 
help for hand-placement, and one must be very careful not to slip 
and fall into the impending doom below. The water is less here, 
but the sound of the rushing river above can be heard more 
clearly. The walkway leads to the north, or back to the south,

right down the sandy riverbank to the waters edge where the 
occasional animal can be seen coming to take a drink. To the

the riverbed itself, causing the waters to crash noisily against 
them. A thin mist of water is ever present in the air as the 
water is churned into a white surf at this point on it's journey.

   Surprisingly spacious despite the clutter, the inside of this 
tent is overflowing with rugs, pillows, beddings and utinsels, 
making the floor difficult if not impossible to find. Yet even 
so, it boasts a comfortably high ridged roof, held up by thin 
wooden poles. Ties along the upper frames permit the colorfully 
woven, goat-hair fabric of the walls to be rolled up and hidden, 
exposing the interior to the outside. Though instead of proper 
walls, the eastern and western sides of this section are instead 
curtains of heavy cloth, effectively dividing the tent into three

   Although the thick, heavy woven goat-hair of the external wall 
remains in this tent, it is usually rolled up, tied out of the 
way to the upper frame of the tent's structure. In its place 
lies instead an inner wall of diaghanous pale blue silk. A 
softer, less utilitarian touch holds sway over this section of 
the tent, its own high ridged ceiling and curtain segmenting it 
from the remainder.

An Unadorned Compartment~
   As lavish as the women's section of the tent is, this section 
is equally spartan and bare of decoration. Thick goat hair walls 
keep the elements at bay, while a bare minimum of rugs thinly 
cover the hard ground. Instead of the pile of rugs and pillows 
found in other sections of this tent, the floor here is piled 
high with instruments of work and craft, crates for storage and 
racks for food and even the occasional animal.

The Interior of a Goat Hair Tent~
   Surprisingly spacious despite the clutter, the inside of this 
tent is overflowing with rugs, pillows, beddings and utinsels, 
making the floor difficult if not impossible to find. Yet even 
so, it boasts a comfortably high ridged roof, held up by thin 
wooden poles. Ties along the upper frames permit the colorfully 
woven, goat-hair fabric of the walls to be rolled up and hidden, 
exposing the interior to the outside.

A Pebbled River Bank~
   The clear waters of the Sheshem Mew lap gently at the pebbled 
bank. The winds rustle through the boughs of a gnarled fig 
lending shelter beneath it's twisted limbs. The ground here is 
sand covered and hard. The gently swaying grasses whisper at the 
touch of the warm southern breeze. Some patchy stunted shrubs 
encircle the area, concealing it from open plains and farmlands.

The Deck of a Small Craft~
   The deck of this boat is well-made but not extravagant. The 
planks underfoot creak as you walk over them but are close enough 
together so that you cannot see below them. A short thick rail 
creates a barrier between the deck of this craft and the water 
below. Along the rail there are several sturdy looking cleats 
that stick out, several of them with rope looped around them. 
When at a dock these pegs are used to tie the craft to the dock. 
On the port side a small gangway is set that can be extended or 
retracted. Rising two short stories up with several windows 
facing out a small structure rises from the aft portion of the 
craft. On the facade of this structure are several lanterns. 
Though the deck is well maintained it is often damp and smells of 
fish due to the spray from the water below.

A Dark Functional Kitchen~
   This kitchen is thin and long, set against the far aft part of 
the craft. Due to a lack of windows the only way one would be 
aware of being on a ship is slow rocking back and forth. Even 
the smell of the water is masked by the smell of food. All along 
the back wall is a large counter with a few spaces open for a 
stove a cistern and other kitchen essentials. A few lanterns 
hung around the room provide much needed light to this otherwise 
dark and utilitarian space.

A Messy Storage Area~
   The sounds of water slapping against the side of the vessel 
echo throughout this entire room. A strong fishy smell permeates 
the air here just as the sound of creaking planks permeates the 
ears. The walls and floor of this room are made of dark sturdy 
planks that remain remarkably dry most of the time. Occasionally 
a small damp area can be found however, testament to the rigors 
the planks endure as a part of the hull of the craft. Spaced out 
by one feet along the starboard and port sides of the room are 
many thick ribs that extend up to the ceiling and down below the 
floor. Though sturdy and well built this area is often messy and 
unpleasant to most people unaccustomed to life out on the water.

A Large and Cozy Bedroom~
   This large bedroom is the largest room on the ship. Two 
windows set into each wall provide natural lighting during the 
day and allow one to see the weather outside. Though, because 
the glass cannot be opened the weather does not actually affect 
the room. Each window is flanked by#2 sturdy shutters#0 which 
stand open. Each wall also sports a lantern to ensure the room 
is always well lit. The swaying of the craft on the water can be 
felt well in this room, as can the smell of the river and wood. 
However, the smell of fish is conspicuously lacking. The walls 
are covered with several pelts and a few sets of horns. Along 
the ground lies a thick lion-skin rug. Though this room is clean 
if one tried hard enough dust could be found on many of the 
surfaces of this room. On the port side of the room a small set 
of steps leads up to a hatch in the ceiling. Warm and cozy, this 
room is the finest on the craft.

A Well-Kept Room~
   This room is remarkably dry and quiet. Unlike the room to the 
west this room's walls do not have any visible ribbing. Instead 
they are covered with yet more wood. This feature makes the room 
slightly smaller but also significantly quieter and less damp. 
The wood on the walls and floors remain dry yet they still creek 
as the craft moves from side to side. The for-most section of 
this room tapers to a point. Though there are no windows several 
lanterns provide ample light. The air smells of an interesting 
mix of wood, burning lantern, water, and fish. Though strange, 
it is not all together unpleasant. Right in the center of this 
space a large sturdy set of steps leads up to the sturdy hatch 
above.

from foot traffic. On the starboard side of the room a sturdy

cannot be opened they do sport#2 heavy wooden shutters#0 which 
stand wide open. The smell of the water is still present, though 
it is also accompanied by a warm and musky scent.

   This open air space is built much like a patio. Along all 
four sides is a sturdy railing separating the patio from the 
river or the deck below. If one were to look out in any 
direction except to the front of the boat the water would be 
seen. And when at port along the port side of the craft the dock 
and mooring would be seen. The smell and sounds of the water 
permeate this space, even the rocking of the craft is better felt 
up here. The front half of the patio is covered by a wooden 
awning, with a lantern on each of the two front posts.
