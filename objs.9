a knobbed iron mace~
An iron mace headed with a knobbed sphere lies here.~
   Comprised of a long hardwood pole with a large, knobbed head, 
this weapon has clearly seen better days. The pole is scratched 
and scarred, and flecks of rust are visible on the head. Strips 
of worn black leather have been wrapped around the handle, 
creating a comfortable handgrip. The end of the weapon is 
rounded, shaped in a smaller knob.

a radiant, mithril bastard sword~
A gleaming, mithril bastard-sword rests on the ground, glowing softly.~
   This hand-and-a-half sword is marvelously light and well
balanced.  It is made of a curious, silver-like metal with a
slight pearl like luster.  It glows with a strange light that
shimmers slightly when the weapon is moved.  It looks to be
a capable, and exceptionally deadly blade.

   Tiny links made from strong links of fine steel have been
knitted together to form a mail shirt.  Each link has been
seamlessly closed.  If welded, there is no visible seam where
the weld was made.  It looks very strong, but amazingly light.

A blackened iron breastplate lies here.~
   This sleekly designed iron breastplate's surface shines a dark 
ebony color. The inside of the armor is padded with a supple 
layer of thick leather for added comfort. The plate itself is 
smooth, crafted by a master hand. A pair of thick leather straps 
allows the breastplate to be held in place, and a small iron 
buckle on each enabling adjustments to the size of the straps.

A pair of blackened plate leggings sits here.~
   These leggings are made of many iron plates riveted together 
securely into coverings that extend from the upper thigh down to 
the calves, leaving room for boots. They buckle along the backs 
in several places, with buckles to hold them onto a vest's lower 
edge. They are made quite well, their surface a glossy black. 
The knees in particular are well-articulated, made of many long, 
narrow plates of steel riveted to bend with the wearer.

a thin mithril bracelet~
A thin mithril bracelet lies here.~
   This bracelet is very thin and made of a curious silvery-metal 
with a luster not unlike that of a pearl. It shimmers as light 
reflects off of its surface, far more than one would expect for 
so thin a piece of jewelry. The bracelet is flat and less than a 
tenth of an inch in width and appears large enough for only a 
woman's delicate wrist. So light it is not even felt, the 
bracelet seems as if it practically floats around the wearer's 
skin.

A small crystal vase rests here, catching and reflecting light through it.~
   This small vase, only six inches high is made from thick, very 
fine crystal glass. From the top, it appears octagonal in shape, 
its edges bevelled. The vase is highly polished and any light 
hitting it is either reflected or refracted, creating a spectrum 
as it shines elsewhere.

An exotically-painted shield set with spears hangs on the wall.~
   This oval-shaped shield is pointed on both ends and painted in
a wild, dynamic pattern of amber-colored and black stripes and
designs. A fringe of coarse, wheat-colored animal hair surrounds
the shield, poking out from behind its edges, and a pair of exotic-
looking barbed spears is crossed atop it, secured into place. The
same coarse animal hair circles each spear's tip below the point,
giving the weapons an exotic look.
   It is a rare and foreign-looking wall decoration.

A long length of colorfully woven silk lies here.~
Great care was obviously taken in the weaving of this piece of
ornamental clothing.  The craftsmanship is as unquestionable as
the artistry.  Interwoven with numerous colors and adorned with
intricate ornamental patterns this piece of clothing is obviously
not meant to be worn everyday but rather as a part of some sort
of ceremonial garb to be worn on special occasions.  If nothing
else, however, it might make an interesting addition to an art
dealers collection.

an exotic, long wooden mask~
An exotic, long wooden mask hangs on the wall.~
   This wall hanging is shaped like an abnormally long mask, 
almost the length of a person's torso, narrow and oblong, with
pointed ends. Slanted slits for eyes and a stylized nose and mouth
give it an otherworldly look. Coarse, wheat-colored animal hair
sticks out from behind it all around its edges. The mask is made
of reddish-orange wood and painted in wild black stripes and
designs, and it is set with a strap in the back for hanging on
a wall. Nobody could wear it as a real mask, due to its size and
unwieldy weight, but it makes an exotic wall hanging.

This boar's head has been severed directly behind the ears, and
mounted upon a thick rough-hewn slice of wood, this then nailed
into the wall. It's sunken eye-sockets have been filled with
something which looks vaguely like badly worked glass balls,
rough pupils outlined in paint. They stare toward each other
with a fixed and crooked glare. The creature's enormous thick
tusks have been filed into upward-thrusting hooks. Each of
these tusks bear traces of black staining, small tufts of hair
and threads of ripped cloth.
