Dam-Occupied Farmland~
   While the eastern horizon is dominated by the bleak peaks
of the Ephel Duath that rise above the thin woodlands and barren
plains of South Ithilien, here, vibrant crops grow year round,
tended by the peasantry of Gondor that works the fields under the
watchful shadow of the south-eastward fort. Spread between the
fields and pastures is the occasional green-watered dam.

Wet, Farmed, Fields~
   Tended fields grow bountiful crops in this section of South 
Ithilien, farmers seen tending to their flocks and produce, 
housed in the numerous daub and wattle cottages that populate the 
green, fallow hills. Numerous paths and wagon tracks cut across 
the cultivated lands, leading between the various farmsteads and 
towards the fortification located on a hill to the south.

Serf-Occupied Land South of a Road~
   Long rows of tilled earth bear crops year round in these lush
lands of South Ithilien, broken every now and again by a grouping
of peasant cottages or orchids of fruit bearing trees. The 
farmlands continue for some distance, but surrounding it in all
directions are long tracts of boggy ground where the Poros and 
Anduin rivers meet.

Fields Before a Walled Town~

across this part of this small, South Ithilien fiefdom, small
animals such as fieldmice and rabbits seen making their way 
through the undergrowth. Elsewhere, farmers work the land, but
are careful to keep a safe distance from any outsiders that may
travel along the rickety dirt paths that cut through the fief.

of foam. Before the river, upon the bank, the soil is soft and
muddy, and thick grass untamed by man grows here, alive with many
small river animals and birds.

beams there is constant movement and watch over the farmlands 
south of this somewhat hurried, yet awkwardly quiet population. 
A few pieces of wooden furniture has been set against the walls 
and a small, rounded table of rough wood sits central to the 
room, its surface scattered with various papers, pieces of 
leather and ink splotches. A wide archway has been constructed 
in the northern wall giving passage to the platform leading north 
to the central tower of this fort. A number of crude flags hang 
tattered, their matter aroused on occasion by the cold winds 
which float around the top of the battlements.

Wooden Battlements Join Westward Here With a Tall Gatehouse~
   This long wooden platform of dark wooden beams which serve as 
battlements continue southwards here in a steady circumference of 
the wooden, spired tower central to the bustling town below 
though a somewhat awkward silence falls over its population. 
Over the crenellated eastern wall can be spied the lands far past 
the town: farmlands, houses and stables where members of the town 
work the fertile lands of South Ithilien. A smaller wooden wall 
along the west side of this battlement prevents movement over the 
edge of the battlements and onto the town some distance below 
though further along the wall and to the west is a large, thick 
wooden door adjoining the battlements with a towering wood 
gatehouse, its tattered flags blowing gently in the wind.

Wooden Battlements Facing East Over a Bustling Town~
   The sturdy battlements composed of thick, dark wooden beams 
here joins westwards to a tall wooden tower, connected simply by 
a long platform. A high, curving arch is set in the side of the 
tall tower and a myriad of flags have been cast up above its 
spired top. Over the crenellated beams of wood to the east can 
be seen vast farmlands of fertile, South Ithilien soil. Close 
than that and within the walls of the town move its population in 
a hurried manner though an awkward silence falls about the place.

Wooden Battlements Looking East over South Ithilien~
   These wooden battlements have been formulated from thick 
wooden beams bound with masonry and taught rope binding. 
Reaching just taller than the height of an average man, the 
eastern walls are neatly crenellated for observation of the lands 
far to the east where farms and houses have begun to develop and, 
of course, the awkwardly silent population of the town below. 
Notched, torn flags fly high over this fort of wooden structure 
in the gentle winds.

Inside a Tall Wooden Gatehouse Facing North Over Fertile Lands of South Ithilien~
   This tall wooden gatehouse is filled with the constant 
movement of people and sentries looking north over the lands that 
this bustling, yet eerily quiet town dominates. A few small 
windows have been cut out of the northern wood wall and a few 
pieces of furniture have been placed around the room for rest. 
Below, through a ladder-affixed trapdoor, can be seen the bottom 
gatehouse filled with dull-clad individuals passing into and out 
of this town, presumably farmers from the surrounding lands and a 
few small buildings can be seen within the walls. Two thick

Wooden Battlements Overlooking a Town, West of a Gatehouse~
   Thick beams of dark, smoothed wood have been strongly bound 
together with masonry and taught ropes to form the western wall 
of these wooden battlements which tower high above the town 
below. The tops of the wooden beams have been neatly cut 
straight and at regular intervals along the wall are small 
crenellations. Looking out over the battlements to the east can 
be seen a somewhat bustling town where people go about their 
daily duties and west are the green, fertile lands of South 
Ithilien where farmers and peasants might be seen toiling away at 
the soil. Though a similar wall crafted of wooden beams runs 
along the eastern side of this platform, a thick wooden door with 
a strange engraving lies to the east, set into a towering wooden 
gatehouse, its notched, torn flags wavering gently in the wind.

Wooden Battlements Facing West Over A Bustling Town~
   The sturdy battlements here connect eastward to a tall, round 
wooden tower by a sturdy wood platform. The platform runs into a 
curving wooden archway above the entrance to the tower which, at 
regular intervals about it structure, has carved into it long, 
thin slits, presumably for archers. Thick, dark beams of wood 
bound by masonry and taught rope compose the crenellated western 
wall and over its edge to the west can be seen the fertile lands 
of surrounding farms and houses; to the east and below is the 
small village which seems enveloped in an awkward silence.

Wooden Battlements Join Eastwards Here With a Gatehouse~
   The thick wooden battlements here overlook a town below 
bustling with variously clad individuals though mainly farmers 
clothed in dulled, torn clothing. Further west over the town's 
vast wooden walls lie the fertile lands of South Ithilien where 
farms and smaller housing has developed. The gates and 
portcullis of the town can be heard constantly opening and 
closing and muffled shouts and orders can be heard through a 
thick door set into the tall wooden gatehouse to the east. Small 
caravans of horse-drawn carts can be seen every now and then 
brought through the town's gates and an uncomforting silence 
looms over this populated place.

Path Through the Dismal Town~
   Thick cobbles of dark stone compose the majority of this north 
and south moving road. A myriad of individuals usually crowds 
its surface as they go about their daily duties and, whilst a 
busied place, it is usually dominated by an awkward silence of 
the folk which live here. A couple of buildings have been set 
off the edge of the road, their inside home to a number of people 
who can be seen passing in and out of the doors. To the north, a 
vast wooden gatehouse adorned with a colourful set of tattered 
flags dominates the surroundings and to the south looms a spired 
stone cathedral which is easily the tallest structure within the 
four walls of this town.

Beneath the Northern Gatehouse~
   A thick, dark wooden gate restricts access north of this 
gatehouse whilst a portcullis does the same in a southern 
direction. Easily in sight is the broad cobbled road which 
passes through this town, its surface dominated by the footfall 
of the farmers, workers and soldiers of the place and, while 
appearing busy and somewhat hectic, an uncomfortable atmosphere 
is certainly apparent. The room is poorly-ventilated, its umber 
wood walls infused with the dank, musty smell of dirt. A few 
iron grates hold torches of flickering orange light that casts 
forth shadows around the otherwise-dark room. The light never 
seems to quite banish all the shadows from the dark corners.

Along a Worn, Cobbled Path Directly Below a Stone Cathedral~
   Looming over the centre of this busied town is a spired stone 
cathedral which connects via wooden platforms to the battlements. 
Though movement seems hurried and enthusiastic, there is an 
awkward atmosphere which constantly drifts over this town. A 
constant muttering can be heard amongst various dark-clad people 
and the peasant farmers which tend to the surrounding lands and 
every now and then a long caravan might be seen traveling this 
broad road. A few establishments fashioned from thick dark stone 
sit off the edge of the road here, their threshold's constant to 
migration of customers, especially the cathedral, situated east 
of the path, accessible through an arched wooden door. The odd 
strangely adorned individuals might be seen passing through the 
door, their heavily cloaked forms moving quietly through the 
various streets of the town though the majority of people that 
crowd the centre are farmers and workers of the lands.

Upon a Cobbled Path Passing North to South Through the Town~
   Composed of broad, thick cobble stones, this road is busied 
with the farmer, worker and soldier population of this bustling, 
yet awkwardly quiet town. Caravans can sometimes be seen passing 
through the town's wooden gates and portcullis and along this 
road, dealing their various trades in the town markets. Carts 
drawn presumably by farmers can also be seen frequently along 
this path as they go about their daily business in this towering 
wood-walled town. Just to the north towers a spired stone 
cathedral, a myriad of notched, tattered flags flying crudely in 
the cold winds above. A few small stone establishments adjoin 
the road here, their threshold constantly passed over by various 
members of the town and to the south can be seen one of the two 
vast gatehouses overlooking this road.

this vast gatehouse and a few pieces of dark furniture have been 
placed around the room. Set in the southern wall is a crude, 
black wooden gate, a small grated shutter apparent in its surface 
and dark iron torch holders have been affixed to the walls to 
cast forth flickering, ample light over this dark room.

A Busy Stables~
   Open and airy, this large barn smells pleasantly of grassy 
hay, leather, and horses. The atmosphere is generally quiet, 
with only slight rustling and the contented sounds of chewing 
floating over the air. A central aisle runs past a long row of 
standing stalls, each with a hay rack and hitch where the 
occupants are tied facing the wall. At the far end, a few loose 
boxes allow roomier accommodations, with a window in each and the 
floors lined with straw. The floor is packed earth, swept clean 
but scattered with bits of straw and hay nonetheless, and above 
the stalls is a loft, stacked high with grassy hay. A few stray 
spider webs collect in high corners, but the building is 
otherwise clean and well cared-for.

unseen. There are cells on every side of this gaol, with iron

having a wild, unconquered look to it, though the local wildlife 
has worn narrow tracks which allow passage through the more 
thickly vegetated areas. The light brown earth is visible in a

Dirt Trail Twisting Under Tall Trees~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles users of wind 
or wildlife filter between the trees

Climbing a Steep, Stoney Rise at the Edge of a Wood~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this

A Bushy Hill Leading Up a Mountain~
   This stretch of hill dips down a little bit before it turns 
and goes only one way: up. A smattering of bushes dot the 
landscape as the tree line gets lower and lower. Rocks become 
more commonplace as the altitude increases and the temperature 
drops as the face of the hill is exposed to wind without any sort 
of shelter. The way west and north goes further up the rocky 
face of the mountain. A path leads down into a clearing of the 
dense forest.

A Small Valley Before Dense Trees and Hills~
   This part of the landscape offers a rest for any travellers 
coming from the hills, and a clear line of sight for any 
travellers emerging from the dense forest in the south. The 
grass in this field is thigh-high, and a trained eye might be 
able to spot the benign insects that cling to the blades of 
healthy grass. To the north, the terrain rises and falls in a 
series of hills. Boulders large and small litter the area near 
the hills. The south goes into a forest with trees packed 
together. The west leads to a steep hike onto a hill, while the 
east would show a path up a ridge.

A Thinning Canopy Along a Ridge in the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower

A Field of Tall, Wild Grasses along the Bank of a Stream~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but

nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might

   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking

curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

Thinning Woods at the Edge of Bare and Rocky Hills~
   The fringes of a great abundance of evergreens that stretches 
far into the distance to the west cling to the bare and rocky 
surface of the high hills that rise towards the east. Careful 
steps are required to navigate mixture of pebbly stone and dusty 
soil that carpets the ground in this region, the uneven ground 
difficult to traverse. To the north and east, a narrow trail 
runs parallel to the steep slopes of the Black Mountains, that 
thrust skywards in defiance of the trees. 
   
   Just to the east, on the face of a rocky hillside, a black 
crevice leers from behind a tall boulder, hinting at a sheltered 
cave beyond.

tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the prickly branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. The carpet of this 
forest's floor is a reddish-brown, laden with the dried needles 
of the evergreen trees. Small seedlings push up from the ground, 
looking like tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground 
itself to seek life. The heady scent of needles overwhelms all 
other odors from the surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of 
freshness. The trail continues north and south through the 
forest, alongside rolling hills to the east.

Flat Plain Following the Bank of a Wide River~
   From south to north the North Ithilien rolls in a gently 
sloped plain, the flat fields lying between the Great river 
Anduin and a line of rolling hills to the east. The plain is 
covered in thick grasses that range from two to four feet in 
height, the land having a wild, unconquered look to it, though 
the local wildlife has worn narrow tracks which allow passage 
through the more thickly vegetated areas. The light brown earth 
is only visible in areas where an ancient trickle of water may 
have once carved a ravine in ages past.

   The hill is steep and laden with pebbles that clatter down the 
southern incline when knocked out of place by the wind, by 
travelers, or by stray wildlife that move through the area. 
Short grass grows on the hillside and a smattering of trees can 
be seen, but the tree line is slowly approaching from above. The 
hills continue north and west, their directions going upward in 
the distance towards the top of the mountain that is visible to 
the northwest. To the east, the thick forest below can be seen 
and a blue stream can be seen into the eastern distance, 
illuminating like a long jewel when the sun or moon shines on its 
waters. A path leads down a steep, rocky path into more green 
forests.

A Corner of Dense Greenery by a Stream~
   To someone coming from the north or west, a crowded forest of 
trees, a network of vines, and a base of bushes has begun and 
continues southward. To the east, the forest comes to an end as 
a streambed takes over, moss taking hold of the earth and rocks 
that make the streambed its home. The stream looks clear and 
chill. Northward, the forest ends and a field among ridges and 
hills begins. Westward, the terrain becomes steep hill. During 
the daytime, the occasional wildlife can be heard going through 
the brush or hopping from tree to tree. At night, the cacophony 
of crickets can turn into an orchestra of music.

pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees at the edge of Ithilien~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

Along the Edge of the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet

tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

A Trail Through the Rich Ithilien Forest~
   The beaten trail continues north and south, placed at the edge 
of the rich Ithilien forest and the rolling hillsides. The birds 
chatter overhead with the squirrels and chipmunks, and random 
bushes rustle as deer and foxes skitter on by. The wind blows 
the leaves together, giving a traveller a crisp, fresh smell of 
the forest and a breeze of cool air along with the pleasant sound 
of the forest playing its symphony.

Flat Plain Extending Northwards From Rolling Hills Along a River~
   From south to north the North Ithilien rolls down in a gently 
sloped plain, the flat fields offering one a fine view of the 
major landmarks of the area; a range of brushy rugged hills 
running to the east and the wide, deep river to the west. The 
plain is covered in thick grasses that range from two to four 
feet in height, the land having a wild, unconquered look to it, 
though the local wildlife has worn narrow tracks which allow 
passage through the more thickly vegetated areas. The light 
brown earth is only visible in areas where an ancient trickle of 
water may have once carved a ravine in ages past.

A Dense Thicket of Trees Before a Rocky Path~
   The trees here are very dense, and it would prove to be 
difficult for a large group to move through here. If one 
attempted it would ruin any proper formation. The dense woods 
continue in all directions except for the north, which is not 
accesible due to a steep, rocky trail heading up into the hills. 
An occasional rock skitters down the path, removed from its place 
by the wind. To the distance in the northwest, the tip of a 
mountain can be seen rising in the air.

A Clearing in Dense Forest by a Streambed~
   The dense trunks of trees, the thick network of vines, and the 
full bushes of leaves come to a temporary end as the forest leads 
into a small clearing. Some trees have fallen here, providing a 
place for creatures to sit or perch themselves upon. There are a 
myriad of rocks and pebbles in the area which lead to the 
fast-flowing stream to the east, its water clear and chill. The 
streambed is adorned by moss, and the occasional critter settles 
by to catch a drink.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

Dirt Trail Snaking Under the Thick Canopy of the Ancient Woods~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles users of wind 
or wildlife filter between the trees

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees East of a Dirt Trail~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Dense Forest by a Streambed~
   Ancient trees rise up from the earth, which is matted by dense 
leaves and needles from ages past that now serve as nutrients for 
the greenery in the present. The thick brush would prove 
somewhat difficult to navigate in for a large group of people. 
During the day, rays of light will occasionally beam down through 
the leaves and onto the layered forest floor. The sound of 
rushing water can be heard, originating in the east where a 
streambed makes its home. The occasional wildlife can be caught 
in the periphery, only to disappear in the thick underbrush.

Thinning Grove of Tall Conifer Trees East of a Stream~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet

surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

   A beaten trail, carpeted by dead leaves and needles of the 
nearby trails, continues north and south at the base of hills 
that lead up into the treacherous mountains. Opposing the hills 
is the vast expanse of the Ithilien forest, a panorama of colors 
every time of the year. Birds can almost always be seen in the 
distance, playing or searching for food.

Hills Covered with Rocks Along the Bank of a Great River~
   A thick growth of low lying bushes roam across the hills of 
North Ithilien that lie between a wide river and tall, ancient 
woods. A larg amount of rocks lie scattered about, the brush and 
grasses growing from around them. Numerous, small wildlife dart 
amongst the clustered clumps of vegetation and rocks, as well as 
the occasional larger predator lurking far from the distant 
forest to the east. A sharp cliff falls away to the west, the 
ever flowing river eating at it continually.

A Dense Packing of Trees~
   The trees continue in all directions. A smattering of greens, 
browns, oranges, and reds create an image fit for a painter's 
magnum opus. Rays of sunlight desperately try to fight their way 
through the thick network of branches and leaves to reach the 
grassy ground. The trunks are tall and the thickness of their 
mess of leaves differ from tree to tree. On the forest floor, a 
thick bedding of dead material from the trees and bushes above 
the ground provides a soft surface to walk upon, and nutrients 
for the generations of trees to come. Many bushes reside on the 
ground and vines hang down to get in the way of passer-bys. The 
wildlife is thick here, the many sounds creating a symphony in 
the dense wildnerness. To the southeast, the sound of running 
water is audible.

In a Thick Forest of Archaic Trees by A Stream~
   This part of the forest is luscious and thick, remaining 
unexploited by any hand. The greenery has grown in thick layers, 
life flourishing here as the aroma of the rich earth and healthy 
trees fills the air. Some fallen trees are visible, their old 
leaves and vines layering the forest floor and feeding the lush 
grass, the strong vines, and vibrant trees that fill the area. 
To the east and south, a stream bubbles and flows with moss and 
pale white mushrooms at the edge where earth meets water. When 
the wind blows, the forest rustles in a gentle symphony that adds 
to the bass of the flowing stream; and the occasional rustle of 
wildlife roaming can be heard in the underbrush.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

Along the Edge of the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

A Trail Deep in the Forest upon Rolling Hills of Ithilien~
   The forest grows a bit sparser as the trail winds up and down 
a hill. Evergreens continue and the path becomes very shady 
during the day as the mighty hills and tall, evergreen tree 
needles hog much of Anor. This is a much more solemn areas, just 
a few birds making their precense known and the squirrels 
chattering away only when it sounds like an argument, or because 
of danger.

Rocky, Hills Along the Bank of a Great River~
   A thick growth of low lying bushes roam across the hills of 
North Ithilien that lie between a wide river and tall, ancient 
woods. Small animal life darts amongst the clustered clumps of 
vegetation, as well as the occasional larger predator lurking far 
from the distant forest to the east. A sharp cliff falls away to 
the west, the ever flowing river eating at continually.

   The trail winds north and south through the woods here, which 
grow lush and thick as they are predominantly untouched. There 
are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the rich 
and earthy smells of forest life. Pale white mushrooms shaped 
like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots among 
the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed the 
vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their battle 
to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or wildlife 
filter between the trees. To the east, the land rises as a 
traveller would have to climb up the steep side of a hill.

Brushy Knoll Rising Above a Great River ~
   Rolling hills extend in every direction away from the sharp 
bank of the great river flowing southwards. They are covered in 
thick grasses that range from two to four feet in height, the 
land having a wild, unconquered look to it, though the local 
wildlife has worn narrow tracks which allow passage through the 
more thickly vegetated areas. The light brown earth is only 
visible in areas where an ancient trickle of water may have once 
carved a ravine in ages past.

Brush Covered Knoll Rising Above A Turn in a Wide River~
   Here, the ancient forces of wind and rain have caused the 
collapse of one side of a grassy hill. The wild, tough grasses 
of the area have yet to tame the resultant gash of earth that 
shows like a wound in an otherwise grassy sea. However, they 
have conquered the rest of the softly undulating ground here, and 
the vegetation resists the legs of the passing traveler just as 
the hills tax them. Thick stands of tress dominate the eastern 
horizon, whilst to the south a rolling field spreads out.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles users of wind 
or wildlife filter between the trees

Dirt Trail Entering a Clearing Amidst a Grove of Tall Trees~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

A Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees on a Ridge~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

In a Thick Forest, by a Stream and Ridge~
   Dense forest covers this landscape, many paths blocked by 
thick webs of vines and a mass of bushes and leaves. The sound 
of flowing water can be heard, originating from the stream to the 
east. Moss and other forms of life reside on the lush streambed. 
The forest floor is rich and layered with the dead material that 
now feeds and supports the new life. To the south, the forest 
upons up and introduces an impassible ridge, a near-vertical drop 
ceases any travel in that direction, the bottom adorned by jagged 
rock that do not form any path that looks climbable.

Ruined Stone Tower on a Ridge Above the Forest~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color. An 
ancient stone foundation, slowly being swallowed up by the ever 
spreading moss, lies near the crest of the ridge. A small gap in 
the ruined tower's foundation allows a descent into the earth 
around it.

Jagged, Rising Ridge Deep in the Forest of Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees beneath a Steep Rocky Peak~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Trail Winding Around the Hills~
   The beaten trail snakes around an outcrop of hills and then 
continues southward on the border of the rolling hills and the 
ancient forest. The trail reaches a high apex here, offering a

horizon would be breathtaking.

A Turn in the Forest Trail~
   The forest through the trees that lay near the rising hills 
moves against the rising earth to snake around it, heading west 
as the forest loses ground against the hill. Hawks can be seen 
as they leave their nests in trees against mountains to search 
for prey in the copses in the ancient Ithilien forest. Their 
calls could reach a traveller's ear. When the wind blows from 
the north, it would offer the many scents of the forest; but if 
wind came from the south, the hills would offer some protection.

Ragged, Brush Covered Hills Above the Great River ~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks. A wide river flows southwards past the jagged cliffs to 
the west, while the hills trail down to a grassy field to the 
south.

stream that flows from the north. A broad, tall mountain of a 
rock rises high above the surrounding forest to the east. The 
terrain rises steeply to the north, a tall, wooded ridge running 
to the west. A constant stream of water falls from the top of 
the ridge, a moist mist rising above the small pool at the bottom 
of the falls. The moisture in the air keeping most surfaces wet 
and the fauna thriving.

A Sparse Grove of Old, Thick Trees North of a Stream at the Bottom of a Stone Cliff~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

In Thick Underbrush Amongst Several Old Trees North of a Stream~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

Under a Thinning Canopy of Tall Trees on the Bank of a Stream~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

Rising Terrain Northwest of a Tall Waterfall~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Rocky Peak with a Cold Water Spring Issuing From a Dark Cave~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day

everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

Along the Edge of the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

A Field of Tall Grass South of Ragged Hills Along a River~
   To the north some ragged, barren hills rise from the sea of 
grass. The grass covered field stretches along the bank of the 
Great River, the tall grass flowing like an ocean of green or 
golden brown when pushed by the wind. The field rolls gently as 
it spreads to the east, wildlife scurry through the grass, hidden 
safetly from would be predators. Birds fly overhead on most days 
their song filling the air, competing with the sound ofthe mighty 
river that flows forever tothe sea. Tall, thick woods can be 
seen way off to the east.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees in Ithilien~
   Most of this area is wooded, and sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
days. A few boulders populate the forest floor, ragged and 
decaying, overgrown in moss and fungi, and nearly as brown and 
green as the giants which tower over them. Although the 
occasional twig snaps in the distance and the leaves rustle with 
the slightest touch of the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet 
hush that hangs over the area. To the south the woods fade into 
a grassy field just before a long, high stone wall which runs 
from west to east in a long, straight, seamless grey line. The 
only visible opening in the wall is a set of iron-banded gates, 
to the south. A narrow dirt trail winds from the gates in the 
south through the forest and to the east.

travel to the south. There is a wide ditch on this side of it, 
filled with fairly stagnant water. The brush has been cleared on 
this side of the wall for a few hundred feet.

stream that flows from the mountains to the east, which rise high 
above the surrounding forest. The stream in this opening of the 
woods is littered with rocks and boulders of various size and 
shapes, some scattered close enough to each other to possibly 
form a natural crossing. Though many of the rocks are wet and 
moss covered, their use is clearly evident. The thick, tall 
trees of Ithilien quickly closes in on the stream to the north and 
south.

A Jagged, Barren Mountain Rising From the Woods of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Deep in the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or

   North of some rolling, rock cluttered hills, a rolling grass 
covered field stretches along the bank of the Great River. The 
tall grasses flow like an ocean of green or golden brown when 
teased by the wind. The field rolls gently as it spreads to the 
east, a variety of wildlife scurry through the grass, hidden 
safely from would be predators. Birds fly overhead on most days 
their song filling the air, competing with the sound of the 
mighty river that flows forever to the sea. Tall, thick woods 
can be seen way off to the east.

An Open, Grassy Field North of Some Rising, Rocky Hills~
   A wide open field of grass spreads out north and east from 
some rising rock covered hills to the southwest. The field rolls 
gently as it spreads out. A variety of wildlife scurries about 
here and there, hidden safely in patches of untouched grass. 
Birds fly overhead on the warmer days, their song filling the 
air. The fields stop at a long stone wall to the north, which 
runs as straight as an arrow from west to east. Its western end 
abuts a high rocky outcrop, making travel to the north impossible 
except through a pair of sturdy, iron-reinforced gates. To the 
east, the wall appears to continue for miles without the 
slightest break.

An Open Field Between a Meandering Stream and a Stone Wall~
   A wide open field of fairly tall grass lies between a ten-foot 
high stone wall to the north and a meandering stream to the 
south. The field rolls gently towards the southwest, where it 
meets the sharp rise of some rocky hills. Numerous paths 
crisscross the area, and the grass has been cut or trampled down 
in a number of areas. It is a peaceful area, and birdsong rises 
above the sound of the flowing water of the meandering stream 
that runs along the southern edge of the field.

A Construction Site North of a Reinforced Stone Bridge~
   A gigantic stone wall is under construction here. Though 
unfinished, it is at least ten feet high and two feet thick, 
blocking off any travel to the north. On this side of the wall, 
the ground has been completely cleared, the grass and roots for 
several hundred feet in all directions torn out, and the earth 
torched. Signs of construction are everywhere, workers dig 
trenches, dress stone, or maneuver stones into place during the 
daylight hours. There are piles of stone, gravel, and other 
construction materials scattered about. The wall stretches 
perfectly straight from the west to the east. To the south, and 
to the west of the bridge, a stone cabin has been constructed.

The stones were laid in rough courses and although they are of many shapes and sizes, they seem to have been fitted together quite skillfully. The building is square, about sixteen feet on a side. The door is on the south side of the building, about fifty yards from the stream. On the north and east sides of the building are glass windows with wooden shutters. The shallowly-pitched roof is made of rough-cut wooden shingles, and a river-rock chimney extends above the roof on the west side of the building.

Several Old Trees North of a Stream and South of a Wall~
   This area is mostly wooded, but to the north there runs a 
large stone wall about ten feet high, made of huge blocks a 
couple feet in every dimension. For a few hundred yards to the 
south of the wall, all brush and trees have been cleared. To the 
south and east, though, is a copse of trees. There is a faint 
odor of decomposing leaves there, and the damp has encouraged a 
vast carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for 
dominance, the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted 
tree-roots, but creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. 
   A stone wall blocks travel to the north.

A Fast Flowing Stream Winding Through Woods South of a Tall Mountain~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles users of wind 
or wildlife filter between the trees

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees in Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

A Rocky Rise Above the Union of a Stream and a River~
   The mighty Anduin meets the flow of a wide tributary to the 
northwest. Its shores are no longer rocky and strewn with stone, 
but are comprised of loose earth overhangs, held together by the 
roots of sparse, knotted trees and wild vegetation. The land 
rises upward here before sheering dramatically downward to meet 
with the river's surface, broken by some landings and narrow 
rocky outcroppings on the way. This height grants a clearer view 
of the Ithilien to the east and of a small village to the 
southwest.

A Fortified Palisade on Top of a Rocky Knoll Rising Above a Stream~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green. 
   Great lengths of wood have been set into place, providing a 
fortified 'guard post'. The rocky knoll provides a clear, 
protected view of the lands all around.

Fast Flowing Stream~
   Fresh, chill waters flow from the east to the south in this 
river, the current strong enough to pull those overly encumbered 
beneath the blue surface and down into the dark, claustrophobic 
underwaters. As one moves to the northern side of the wide, yet 
crossable river, tall trees grow along the crumbling bank.

A Newly Reinforced Stone Bridge Crossing a Stream~
   The continual sound of flowing water is ever present here, as 
a meandering stream passes underneath this ancient stone bridge. 
The bridge, though many years old is of stout construction, the 
individual stones arranged perfectly. A thick layer of moss 
covers most of the surfaces of the stones as well as the forest 
floor that surrounds the bridge. The aroma of the moss 
overwhelming the scent of the decomposing leaves that litter the 
groung here as well. The damp has encouraged a vast carpet of 
green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance.

Along the Edge of the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

   The rock face on the north slightly overhangs the path, its 
western end blocking passage in that direction. Fan like boughs 
hold long, soft needles resembling filigreed lace akin to ferns 
on the trees here which grow to four times the height of a man. 
Whorled leaves grow on the branches of large open shrubs at 
forest floor level. 
   Against the backdrop of the sky above, large arboreal nests 
can be seen in the branching boughs of the trees.

A Wide Stream Twisting Around a Rise to the Northeast~
   A widening stream twists it's way out of the woods of Ithilien 
from the north, the land rising to the norteast forcing it to 
flow south and then west. The depth of the stream varies greatly 
here but generally runs deep in its center. The water is quite 
clear, allowing one to see the multitude of life that it 
supports. To the east a narrow trail runs north and south 
through the edge of the tall, ancient trees of Ithilien. Along 
the south bank of the stream, another narrow trail runs east and 
west, an expansive green meadow lying on the other side.The 
soothing sound of flowing water and the soft sounds of wildlife 
are ever present in the air here.

A Narrow Dirt Trail South of a Reinforced Stone Bridge~
   The narrow trail leads to an ancient stone bridge to the 
north, the bridge arching majestically over a meandering stream. 
To the east, trees rise up, shades of brown and remnants of 
green, from a thick carpet of dead leaves and needles, their 
branches twining like fingers interlaced overhead, barely letting 
the light of day through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up 
from the rich mulchy soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest 
pinpoint of sun to creep from the pungent layer of decay and 
rise. The hardiest of plants and vines twine around the giant 
sentinels that rise in a desperate bid for life and light.

Under the Thick Canopy of the Trees South of a Stream~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees. A meandering stream passes 
through the woods just to the north.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees in Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet

tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

   A wide, slow flowing stream makes it's way past a rise in the 
land to the north and the thick woods to the northeast. The 
depth of the stream deepening quickly as it leaves the southern 
bank. The water though, is still quite clear, allowing one to 
see the multitude of life that the water supports. Following the 
south bank of the stream, a narrow trail runs east and west, 
tall, sharp pointed palisades continue to run east and west on 
the southern side of the trail. The soothing sound of flowing 
water and the soft sounds of wildlife are ever present in the air 
here.

Lying south of the trail tall, sharp pointed wooden palisades 
prevent passage to the south. The slightest breeze causes the 
grass to bend, mimicking the waves on the surface of a body of

overgrown by moss and fungi, rise above the grass. The soothing 
sound of flowing water and the many soft sounds of wildlife are

A Junction of Trails Between a Grassy Meadow and a Line of Trees~
   At the meeting of a vast meadow and the edge of the ancient 
woods of Ithilien, a dirt trail branches off to the west from 
another dirt trail that runs north and south. Although the 
occasional twig snaps in the distance and the leaves rustle with 
the slightest touch of the wind's fingers, the soft sound of 
flowing water fills the air constantly. A ways off to the 
northwest, a meandering stream twists through the woods, coming 
along side the narrow path that runs off to the west. The main 
trail itself, running north and south, with tall, sharpened 
palisades running south from this junction, forming the corner as 
the palisades continue to run west and south a short distance 
from the road.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Within a Grove of Tall Conifers Following a Sharp Ridge~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Thick Underbrush About Several Thick and Old Trees at the Edge of Ithilien ~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

Thick Woods at the Edge of a Deep Slash in the Forest~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Wooded Slash in the Forest of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day

everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Thick Underbrush at the Edge of a Sheer Drop-off ~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Tall Trees Growing to the Edge of a Sheer Drop-off~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

A Thinning Canopy in the Ancient Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

A Break in the Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees at the Edge of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Barren Hills Rising Southeast of a turn in an Ancient Road~
   Stretching into the distance is a low range of hills, barren 
and devoid of nearly everything but the occasional twisted, 
petrified tree. Bands of alternating colored rock sometimes mar 
the surface of the hills, the rich ochre, crimsons and greys 
striping through the vastness of the rock. Just within sight is 
another range, this one stretching a little bit beyond the first, 
beyond that, black mountains soar towards the sky. An ancient, 
dis-used road curves about the base of the hills here.

Along the Edge of the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The forest grows densely here where it abuts a stark grey 
cliff face to the north. The decaying scent of decomposing 
leaves is overwhelmed by a more fetid odor. Sure enough, the 
damp has encouraged a vast carpet of green moss to vie with the 
fallen leaves for dominance, the moss not halting at the gnarled 
and twisted tree-roots, but creeping up the trunks with damp 
fingers. The grey and brown tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the 
hue and though there is nowhere near as much undergrowth and 
small plants as one might expect, still everywhere the eye turns 
is verdant color. Several small game trails wend their way under 
the boughs of the giant trees.

Fields Cleared Among A Grove on the Bank of a River~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light. An area of 
land has been cleared away for crops and fields and a small sign 
is stuck into the edge of one of the fields. Tall palisades rise 
to the south, a gate set into part of it.

A Thinning Canopy in the Tall Trees South of a Deep Pit~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Conifer Trees Between a Deep Canyon and a Field~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Amongst a Grove of Tall Deciduous Trees Deep in Ithilien~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

Barren Hills Between the Black Mountains and an Ancient Road~
   Stretching into the distance is a low range of hills, barren 
and devoid of nearly everything but the occasional twisted, 
petrified tree. Bands of alternating colored rock sometimes mar 
the surface of the hills, the rich ochre, crimsons and greys 
striping through the vastness of the rock. Just within sight is 
another range, this one stretching a little bit beyond the first, 
beyond that, black mountains soar towards the sky.

Sloping Field Along the Bank of a River, North of a Ridge~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday. Along the northern palisade walls a gate 
is set into it.

There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their

Huge Stones Setting Against Rising Terrain Within the Woods~
   At the southern edge of a small clearing in the woods, where 
sunlight barely filters through the dim gloaming of deep forest 
on even the brightest of day, three enormous boulders stand. 
Cragged and decaying, overgrown in moss and fungi, they are 
nearly as brown and green as the giants who tower around them, 
hemming them against a rise in the terrain. Although the 
occasional twig snaps in the distance and the leaves rustle with 
the slightest touch of the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet 
hush that hangs lower than the intertwined branches overhead. 
There may be life nearby, but here, all lies still. 
   
   An aroma of decay rises from around the boulders, particularly 
strong near a narrow gap between the stones.

Under a Thick Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien on the Bank of the Anduin~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way. 
   A small islet sets just off the bank, no more than a long 
stride needed to reach it. A massive, gnarled willow tree, alone 
stands on slight rise of the islet.

carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color.

Deep in the Ancient Forest of Ithilien~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Under the Thick Canopy of the Ancient Trees of Ithilien~
   In the center of this clearing, where sunlight barely filters 
through the dim gloaming of deep forest on even the brightest of 
day, three enormous boulders stand. Cragged and decaying, 
overgrown in moss and fungi, they are nearly as brown and green 
as the giants who tower over them, hemming them into this 
canopied break in the woods. Although the occasional twig snaps 
in the distance and the leaves rustle with the slightest touch of 
the wind's fingers, there remains a quiet hush that hangs lower 
than the intertwined branches overhead. There may be life 
nearby, but here, all lies still.

Tall, Sharp-Edged Stones are Thrust up from the Floor of the Forest~
   As far as the eye can see, trees rise up, shades of brown and 
remnants of green surrounding one from the thick carpet of dead 
leaves and needles underfoot to the twining of branches like 
fingers interlaced overhead to barely let the light of day 
through. Vines and low-lying plants rise up from the rich mulchy 
soil, taking advantage of even the tiniest pinpoint of sun to 
creep from the pungent layer of decay and rise. The hardiest of 
plants and vines twine around the giants sentinels that rise 
everywhere in a desperate bid for life and light.

A Rocky Rise Along the Bank of the Great River~
   The mighty Anduin flows beneath a tall outcropping of stone, 
its shore below no longer rocky and strewn with stone, but is 
comprised of a loose earth overhang, held together by the roots 
of sparse, knotted trees and wild vegetation. The land rises 
upward here before sheering dramatically downward to meet with 
the river's surface, broken by some landings and narrow rocky 
outcroppings along its path. The height of this rise provides a 
clearer view of the Ithilien to the north and west. The trees 
once again dominating the land to the north.

A Ridge Above a Tree Filled Hollow at the Edge of a Forest~
   No grass grows under the weight of the dead leaves coating the 
ground in a thick and slippery film. Dim greyness dominates, the 
trees growing thickly together to dim and darken the seeking 
arrows of sunlight. The trees themselves rise from the ground, 
curving, twisting, grey and knotted bark home to beetles and 
black ants that only add to the sense of shifting and twining 
movement within the dark confines of this copse. Damp and chill 
in the faux twilight, the scent of organic rot is pervasive and 
assails the nostrils of all who pass this way.

At the Edge of a Thick Woodland ~
   Dark and shifting shadows dart through the bark and branches 
with or without the wind. The grey trees with their lumpy, bumpy 
trunks make this section of woods feel undeniably eerie. 
Underneath, dead leaves do not crunch, but instead suffer a 
gelatinous decay in the damp mud which sucks hungrily at footwear 
and clings nefariously to hooves, fur, or fabric. Sound seems as 
muted as the light which valiantly, if unsuccessfully, tries to 
pierce the overhanging branches, leaving the region dark even at 
the height of midday.

tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green. A 
few paces southwest of a narrow dirt trail that curves through 
the woods here, a rather thick trunked tree stands slightly 
alone. Markings can be seen in the thick bark of this tree.

'A Disturbed Battlefield Above a Narrow Trail'~
   The decaying scent of decomposing leaves is overwhelmed by a 
more fetid odor. Sure enough, the damp has encouraged a vast 
carpet of green moss to vie with the fallen leaves for dominance, 
the moss not halting at the gnarled and twisted tree-roots, but 
creeping up the trunks with damp fingers. The grey and brown 
tree-trunks are overwhelmed in the hue and though there is 
nowhere near as much undergrowth and small plants as one might 
expect, still everywhere the eye turns is verdant color. 
   The remnants of battle linger throughout this area, in the 
form of whirling footprints, disturbed foliage, arrows sticking 
out conspicously from various trunks. The combatants' mark is 
visible everywhere and leading in all directions, and further 
observation yields little.

Thick Gnarled Roots Twisting Against the Mountainside~

split by ancient immense roots spreading out from charred stumps, 
as if a battle between nature and the ancient depths of darkness 
took place. All around, smaller plants grow in tight clusters

evergreen leaves. Tiny birds dart about in a frenzy of motion, 
flitting from branch to branch disregarding the season in their 
search for food.

south. The soil is solid but is crumbly in certain places,

support heavy branches which obscure the ground below, denying 
underbrush the freedom to grow. Arching and fine-textured 
branches in a riot of color during the warm months define the

lives wholly free from the ground below finding safety and

small groves between the copses of larger trees are small yellow 
needled trees which grow to the height of a man. Several of 
these have been stripped of their needles and crudely hacked in

stately lie strewn about the forest floor some still displaying a

A Wide Slow Flowing Stream, Feeding the Anduin to the West~
   A wide, slow flowing stream makes it's way past a rise in the 
land to the north and the thick woods to the northeast. The 
depth of the stream deepens quickly from its southern bank. The 
water though, is quite clear, allowing one to see the multitude 
of life that the water supports. Following the south bank of the 
stream, a narrow trail runs east and west, an expansive green 
meadow lying on the other side. The soothing sound of flowing 
water and the soft sounds of wildlife are ever present in the air 
here.

In a Gap Underneath a Huge Stone~
   A shallow bowl shaped grotto sits underneath a huge boulder, 
hemmed in on most sides by more boulders of like size. A small 
pool of water collects in the center of the dirt floor of the 
grotto whenever a heavy rain falls outside, otherwise the floor 
is quite barren. The width of the grotto allows for several men 
to stand, however the height of the ceiling varies significantly, 
in some places allowing for only the shortest of men to stand 
upright. Towards the southern edge of the chamber a narrow dark 
cave descends deeper into the earth. 
   
   An aroma of decay rises from deeper in the tunnel.

A Twisting Tunnel Bending North and East~
   Loose dirt surfaces continually alter the size and shape of 
this twisting, narrow tunnel. The floor, though dirt has been 
slightly packed due to the heavy passage of something upon it. 
Thick roots of tall trees far above, pierce the soil in many 
places here, some reaching out to snag whatever clothing or flesh 
that passes to close. 
   
   A strong stench of burnt flesh rises from the eastern passage 
in the tunnel.

Wide Rough-Walled Chamber Deep in the Earth~
   The walls of this irregular shaped chamber are of packed 
earth, bits of it falling to the floor just whenever. The 
ceiling, held in place by numerous roots twisted in a random 
weave, is of dirt as well. An uneven dirt floor has several 
piles of dirt and numerous rocks spread across it. Nestled 
intermixed with the dirt and rock are piles of dead grass, leaves 
and branches. 
   
   An overpowering stench of burnt flesh permeates the heavy air 
in this chamber.

Collapsed Entry Hall to an Ancient Stone Tower~
   Originally an arched and reinforced gate must have stood here, 
though now the entry hall is little more than an exposed section 
of rubble, vertical supports for the tower above only barely in 
place, amidst collapsed walls and sunken paving. Low plants 
reclaim much here and there are even signs of bird nests above in 
some of the decaying alcoves.

Central Hall Within a Stone Tower~
   Through cracked stone paving, overgrond with weeds and split 
in many places, this decaying small windowless hall offers little 
except spiral stairs leading up and down and an awkward passage 
out of the tower. Nature vies with ancient walls here, the 
entire structure now like a rising formation of rock grown from 
the forest itself.

   A circular hall can be made out through the wreckage of piled 
statues and collapsed pillars. Earth has fallen into most of 
this chamber, filling the southern and eastern walls so they are 
nothing more than insect-strewn banks of black soil. The 
stairwell here rises and falls, with the air from above fresher 
than below.

collapse of the room above. Atop this place, the view over the

approach to the tower below clearly seen down to the north. A 
smaller ruin of a similar building can be seen not too far to the

A Break in the Thorns~
   Thorns and underbrush suddenly give way to this small, 
semicircular depression in the forest floor. Long ago, a spring 
bubbled to the surface here, perhaps giving rise to a small 
brook, but centuries of silt and forest detritus have swallowed 
the waters once more, leaving no more signs of them then a low, 
marshy patch near the center of the clearing. Leaning in from 
all sides, the moss-hung limbs of squat old trees encase the sky 
above, reducing it to a few fractured angles above and preventing 
all but the strongest of winds from reaching this place.

A Damp, Noisome Cave Beneath the Hills~
   The shifting of some ancient watercourse in a past age left 
this wide grotto nestled under the hills, hidden from daylight. 
It retains a glistening, clinging dampness that has given rise to 
great growths of slime and fungi upon the walls, and the uneven 
floor is studded with shallow, mineral-crusted pools of water. 
Rounded, lumpish boulders litter the place and the paler hues of 
chalky bones, many split or gnawed to rounded nubs, show in many 
places.

In a Musty Cavern of Scraped Stone~
   Roughly-worn limestone walls encircle this colossal cavern, 
scraped outward and shaped by some ancient method. Stalactites 
cling to the roof of the cavern like icicles, their tips 
glistening with cloudy water. Massive stalagmites rise like 
columns from the ground below, their edges frowning with deep 
grooves. The soupy air here is swirling with motes of dust and 
echoes every sound from any corner of the cavern, the most common 
being the steady drip of water from the roof overhead into 
shallow pools beneath. Though the cavern floor is largely 
uneven, it appears to have been leveled to th east, where a 
great, square hallway has been burrowed into its stony wall.

In a Timeworn Antechamber~
  This rectangular antechamber has been burrowed through the 
solid rock of a limestone mountain, its roughly-chiseled walls 
bearing many imperfections. Though narrow in width, the chamber 
is quite long and lofty, the roof above bumpy and uneven. The 
ground underfoot is dusted with a layer of chalk which clings to 
the soles of one's feet. To the west the room opens out into a 
much larger, circular cavern. To the east, the chamber's expanse 
abruptly halts at a pile of stony rubble - it appears that the 
high ceiling of the chamber has collapsed in that direction. A 
small gap at the top of the pile seems to suggest that another 
enclosure may lie beyond.

Concealed Entrance to the Lower Levels of an Ancient Tower~
   Rubble is scattered here and there, some of the stones looking 
naturally placed, others clearly manufactured. Time has taken 
its toll on all of them and slowly moss is doing its best to 
reclaim the stones. A stone staircase spirals down into darkness 
and cold earthy air. A very large tree stands on its own amongst 
the debris, its bark marred and torn on its south face.

Narrow Stairwell~
   The stone staircase spirals and twists down into the darkness. 
Its steps are worn by the passage of many as well as time. The 
stones walling this area, some missing and instead replaced by 
pure earth do little to absorb sound. Scrapes, jingles and the 
padding of boots can all easily shatter the almost over-powering 
silence. The darkness remains a difficult foe to defeat, though.

A Hidden Treehouse Overlooking A Stone Crossing~
   The branches of this tree hang low and full, completely 
concealing the treehouse from outside view. Fortunately, deft 
hands are able to maneuver the branches from someone's way, and 
allow them to peek out. To the north, and in fact just under the 
treehouse, a river can be heard flowing. The view to the north 
shows a stone crossing across the river. A simple roof provides 
protection from the elements that the tree's leaves can't stop, 
but few ameneties other than that are provided by the treehouse. 
No walls exist, and wind can pass through quickly with an eerie 
howling sound.

A Sturdy Treehouse, Overlooking a Road~
   This treehouse was built with stability and durability in 
mind. As well as a good view. It is positioned right over the 
corner of a road's turn, looking either north or east allows a 
clear view of the road and its occupants or travellers. Walls 
are built up, providng protection against the elements, and 
perhaps other things as well. In each wall are cut a few simple 
windows with arrow slits around them as well. A small hole in 
the floor allows one to slip out of the treehouse and down onto 
the tree holding it.

A Square Rock Chamber~
This low chamber cut out of the mountain is relatively small and perhaps serves as a storeroom. It is damp and cold, with clear marks in the rock floor of the dragging of heavy objects.

A Flat-Roofed Large Cave~
   Carefully hewn out of the rock itself, this spacious cave 
forms a dip in the middle, with all sides leading down to it. 
The walls are streaked with the moisture of a thousand years and 
strange and dark colors rebound from lantern or torchlight. Set 
in the carefully flattened roof above are many holes, though none 
large enough to gain sight of what is above. An odd rectangular 
hole has been carved above the entrance to the cave at the edge 
of the northern tunnel.

A Derelict Foyer~
 Jutting, jagged jaws, the dark wooden floorboards of this 
foyer are severely shattered and disarm notions of trustworthy 
footing. Rotting heavily, the outer layers of the wood peels 
back to expose soft ground below where termites fester in reddish 
packs. Dilapidated support beams have crumbled beneath the hand 
of time and fail to uphold a sagged ceiling that is wrestling 
with the weight of vines, the plants crawl through pockets of 
cracks to fester over the walls. Windows stand agape with broken 
glass tinted grey by age, once sharp edges tempered by the thick 
nets of cobwebs tangled with dead insects and spiders. Some 
areas can be seen leading from the foyer, though a massive 
portion has been blocked off by rubble.

An Abandoned Sitting Room~
A shabby, crumbling chimney towers over the remains of what 
was once a sitting room. The leftovers of shattered, neglected 
furniture are strewn carelessly about run-down floorboards which 
are pockmarked with holes. Vast walls are run through with thick 
cracks that have wedged themselves into it. Moth-eaten curtains 
flutter whimsical over hollow, dirt-choked windowsills that 
overlook a disordered garden beyond. There is a somewhat pungent 
scent in the air, the stifling scent of dust thick combined with

Before a cozy cabin~
   The small path that cuts through the meadow leads to a cozy 
looking cabin up ahead. A straw roof enforced by wooden beams 
sits snugly atop large white walls. Small pebbles litter the 
path underfoot, though grasses rear up rather high wherever they 
can, providing a constant draw for wildlife and other birds. A 
birdsnest can be seen nestled in the overhang of the rooftop, 
though found empty more often than not.

A Crumbling Hallway~
   A withered treebranch has pierced through the ceiling of the 
hallway, impairing travel somewhat and suffocating the berth of 
the passage with spindly branches caught within vines and 
tattered threads of webbing. Underfoot lays twigs and dry leaves 
brittle with age. Nature has further reclaimed the area with 
patches of moss that grow abundantly under years of rainwaters 
soak, the walls discoloured from the punishment. Here a musky 
wind creeps through and the surroundings provide no cover from 
the spores of dust that drift about everywhere.

A Refuse-Filled Servants Quarters~
   A sense of aged decay enhanced by layers of dust is overlooked 
by once lofty, dark-wooden pillars. The pillars have been 
masterful engraved with ranks of ivy, done with such detail that 
it might seem to the casual observer, as if they were growing out 
of it, traveling in intricately sprawling patterns towards the 
rooftop. Though the artistry of the pillars have not spared them 
from the brutality of their assailants as a large number of them 
hacked through and toppled over. Others have been mutilated in a 
similar fashion, spared little dignity. The mahogany floorboards 
are sagged to such an extent that the room appears lopsided with 
one end higher than the other. Piled high against the eastern 
wall in the form of a makeshift barricade are various bits of 
furniture, well-worn and in a state of disarray. The walls are 
the bearers of jagged marks cut deep and clean into the stone, 
accompanied by barely visible patches of red where stains have 
not been completely erased by either time nor fade.

Within a Large, Dank Cave~
   Muddy brown mushrooms have overrun the walls of this dank cave 
and few bear solitude in their growth, the majority interlaced in 
a network of thick, deformed clumps that thrive under the dim 
light afforded by the bush-riddled entrance of the cavern. 
Moisture clings in glossy droplets to the naturally dark stone of 
the rugged, uneven walls, dripping down constantly to create a 
thin sheet of liquid upon the ground. The cave worms its way 
deeper into the hollows of the earth, becoming rougher in its 
growth.

A Sprawling, Dank Cave~
   No natural light can be found here; the shadows as rich and as 
deep as the cave is long. Ramshackle nests are lined along the 
wall, almost as if in a mockery to order, chaos soon induced in 
the contents of the chosen bedding; midden plants and animal furs 
forced together and padded down with mud and grass. Hunks of 
earth interrupt the natural stone surface of the ground, 
sprinkled with the bones of small animals. Other skeleton 
remains - larger are found closer to the nests and a fleshy 
stench fills the air like incense.

In the Back of a Cave~
   Roughly hewn logs have been hacked into blockish shapes that 
vaguely resembles some form of shelves along the cave wall. 
Blackish, brackish water lays pooled over the ground and the 
distinct tinge of urine is prevalent. Crudely knotted ropes 
dangle from outcroppings of stone on the ceiling, with various 
skulls attached through to it with woven grass. Straw drifts 
underfoot within the dark puddles, rotting and fetid.

A Rounded Cavern~
   Distinctly round, this section of the cave has been hacked out 
of the stone boundaries put there by nature. In the wake of its 
expansion is a uneven, jagged floor home to scratches and marks 
from chafing of some kind. Large wooden cages are crammed 
against each one another. In the center of the area is a large, 
ash-filled pit decked with charred bones and hair. There is a 
rust-coloured undertone to the ground which flakes off easily 
when brushed against.

Within a Grimy Cavern~
   The walls of this cavern have been smeared brown with a 
combination of feces and mud that keeps any sunlight from 
reaching through cracks. The squalid state extends to the floor 
which is spotted with greasy stains and a slapdash of rotten 
leaves. Bugs delight in the state of it, and cockroaches scurry 
about in the darkness thick and fat from the ripe bounty of their 
surroundings. Muddy patches can be found in some areas. The 
state of the walls provides the perfect setting for the nests of 
bats who have found refuge in its nooks and crannies.

A Fume-Covered Cavern~
   A fog of yellow-green fumes hangs low over the floor of the 
cavern, erupting up into high-reaching clouds whenever the 
sulpherous liquid in pockets in the stone erupts with a splash. 
Bubbles often boil into the air just to burst in small sprays of 
moisture. A somewhat precarious plank path leads through the 
cave, suspended above the ground by thickly woven ropes. The 
darkness is nearly absolutely, save for the weak light which 
comes from the gleam of insects clinging to the ceiling far 
above.

Crushed ash clings onto everthing, giving this area a somewhat

An Overgrown Courtyard~
   Weeds growing excessively uproot dirty cobblestones, brutally 
evicting them from their foundations below. Brittle debris is 
buried beneath myriads of thick-stemmed ivy that spill 
uncontrollably from the husks of deserted buildings nearby, the 
walls crumbling and weak. A degenerate fountain, capped by a 
crippled statue of an obelisk remains in the center of the 
courtyard, smeared with a varnish of stains left by weather and 
mold. Embraced within its chipped pool is a puddle of foul, 
brackish water fringed by small insects which dwell upon its 
surface. Between the ruins marigolds and lavender bud colourful 
flowers on lazy growing stems, constantly overshadowed by the 
stretch of canopies from saplings and older trees burdened by the 
weight of thick leaves and the nests within them. The skeleton 
of a large building rises to the north, while small paths extend 
in other directions.

Along a Midden Path~
   Wooden planks lay rotting and forgotten over a thin path, 
infringing on the territory of coarse, knee-high grasses and 
oval-leaved, thorn-sprouting bushes. The smell of refuse 
interludes with the scents of the surrounding forest; a subtle, 
musky tang of decay blended with fresher undertones, that of 
grass and loamy earth. Between the many small buildings that 
have collapsed, one remains standing nearby. Its door hanging 
askew with the hinges no longer able to fully support it, the 
tears within the wood reveal black peppered marks where it has 
wasted away.

An Old Forge~
Thick soot scars the stone walls of this square building. Ash 
has merged with the litter of dead leaves layering the floors, 
swept in through the gaping doorway to faroff corners where they 
have been left to decompose and wither. A large stone forge 
rests slightly slanted, patchwork patterns of pale grey scrawled 
over the side where coal has left its mark, its belly a darker 
tone where fires have taken flame before. A small smoke funnel, 
still intact, makes for the constant arrival of fresh air through 
its mouth breathing lightly into the room. Iron hooks have been 
hammered into the walls, rust forming around their ends. The small
lines of a trapdoor can be seen nearby the forge.

A Mold-ridden Stable~
   A large archway built securely on stone beams open into a 
large stable area, a solid structure which is reflected in the 
design of the individual stall walls which still stand strong. 
In contrast, each stall door has been capped with wooden carvings 
which has not shared a similar fate; warped and crooked, creating 
now merely distorted images of what they might have once 
represented. A hayloft has deteriorated along with part of the 
roof, both of which introduce chaos to the floor, clumps of stone 
and wood laying in fragments. It is there that mold festers, 
layering what it can in a pungent, sticky green coat.

Within a Dank Basement~
   There is no source of natural light here; darkness expands 
into a damp, dank chamber that extends for some distance at a 
downwards angle, crawling deeper into the earth. Spent torches 
are cupped in brackets that cling to the walls, framed by 
networks of spiderwebs whose silvery-threads gleam dully even 
within the shadows. The entire basement is carved uniformly out 
of dark grey stone, blockish support pillars placed at

A Rising Oak Tree~
   Rising above the forest floor, this oak tree is clearly

easily big enough for a small humanoid or larger creature to walk 
along. Beetles and small spiders move constantly among the 
foliage. Ivy climbs high above and wraps the oak in a tight 
embrace.

The Southern End of an Ancient Stone Bridge~
   The stones which make up this still-sturdy bridge have been 
blackened by fire, chipped, and otherwise damaged on the surface, 
but the structure as a whole seems, at a cursory glance, as 
sturdy as ever. In a square at the southern end, just above the 
rise from the platform below, sits a rectangle in which blocks 
frequently rise up, apparently once the sight of the gatehouse; 
lack of these bricks likewise indicates where gates allowing 
access stood to the bridge north and down to the further 
fortifications which once stood below. Now, though, the rubble 
has been cleared, and these stones, cracked and damaged in the 
collapse, are the only thing to speak of the defensive value this 
bridge once held.

enough space to house several dozen men. Along its southern 
face, archer holes line the walls, one every few feet. Above 
them a small iron cage carry torches providing this room with 
abundant light and some warmth against the cold. The room itself 
has little decoration, bare stone and a few threadbare rugs are 
its only adornment.

A Small Armory And Smithy~
   The smell of coals and smoke fills this small stone room, and 
in one corner the hard stone appears fire blackened. Fastend in 
to the brickwork several wood and wrought iron racks have been 
fitted with the clear intent of holding various weapons, shields 
and armour. Above the fire blackened corner, a narrow hole leads 
out of the roof, letting a single stab of light enter the other 
wise torch-lit room. A heavy door of banded wood leads back to 
the bunkhouse.

Atop A Squat Tower~
   Looking down over the area below, this tower commands a fine 
few of the area south of the river. Made of the same strong 
stone the rest of the gatehouse is made of, it stands the test of 
time, though clearly has been left in poor care, the high open-air 
windows of the tower crumble and crack along its edges, the walls 
themselves have tiny shrubs and the occasional birds nest built in 
to the faltering stonework. Enclosing the top of this tower, a large catapult has been built and remnants of roof hang about it.

A Narrow Stone Corridor~
   This high arching stone tunnel is wide enough for perhaps 
three men. It is roughly fifteen feet in length from end to end 
and rises about ten feet at its highest point. The plain grey 
stone walls are lined with various hooks and ledges that might 
have once been the home of some great trinkets or prizes; but 
now, much like the rest of the area, the they are desolate. At 
the east end of the corridor is an old iron gate, rusting and 
tarnished in nature. At the opposite end is a thick wooden door 
which is banded with similar leashes of metal. Every five or so 
feet along the top edges of the walls are barred up outlets which 
allow the area to breath and offer a notable amount of light to 
seep in during the daylight hours.

An Empty Common Room~
   The most noticable feature of this circular room is its size, 
it is a small windowless hall that bears little more than a 
staircase leading up. It about fifteen feet across at its widest 
point, offering enough room for a few odd pieces of furniture. 
The walls have been fashioned with careful worksmanship, the 
blocks of the walks seamlessly connected into one flat, monotone 
surface. To the east is a long narrow corridor and up the stairs 
is a spacious bunkroom or office.

A Decayed Officer's Room~
   Circular and apparently some sort of officer's or noble room, 
this area probably served as the private quarters of whomever was 
in charge of the sentries of this tower. Long gone in time, 
disuse and neglect have left a thick film of grime and dirt over 
the walls and floors. Some birds have chosen the best spots 
below the rafters to settle their nests and evidently this room 
has seen some use as refuge for travelers or soldiers, for the 
small hearth towards the western wall holds a hefty amount of 
cold, old ashes. Each cardinal point holds narrow, tall windows, 
which must have hold shutters in the past, against the weather, 
intrusion or attack, but those are gone, only rusted hinges 
remaining. Communication with the rest of the tower is performed 
through a spiraling, counterclockwise staircase, which ascends 
and descends to the top and bottom. What must have been a strong 
defense for those living here has vanished into decay, and the 
trapdoors now barely hold together, allowing the rain and refuse 
to seep from upwards, compounding the decadence of this once 
spartan yet comfortable room.

At the Top of the Tower~
   Fifteen feet in diameter, the top of this circular tower 
offers an excellent perspective of the southern and northern 
approaches to the bridge. Crenellated to allow cover and 
protection for anyone standing as sentry here, the battlements 
are chest high and evidently meant for men of a time long past, 
of tall height and long sight. Lesser men can, however, easily 
cover the bridge with arrows, alleviating any attack to the 
gatehouses, while enjoying the safety offered by the difficulty 
of shooting diagonally from the ground and covering the 
significant distance to the tower. The age of the building shows 
from several ruined battlements and on the worn, old stones 
which, despite the weathering of the ages, stand fitted firmly, 
defying the passage of strife and time. 
   A slightly rotted trapdoor offers passage below while failing 
to keep the inclemencies of weather from the unfortunate 
occupants of the tower.

A Cabin Within A Woodland Clearing~
   Surrounded by a small area of farmland, this cabin nestles on 
a slight rise in the land. Ancient trees push out of the rich 
soil of Ithilien to form a rim at the edge of the furrowed land. 
A solitary path of slate-grey river stone leads up towards this 
solidly-constructed cabin. The exterior walls comprise stacked 
logs of hardwood. The roof slopes back at a steep angle to the 
north, built to slough off any snow that accumulates there. A 
quaint porch is elevated some, requiring the use of wide steps at 
the fore. A door lays beyond, leading inward, while the path of 
simple flagstone draws southward towards the fields. Beside the 
door, hanging, is a small brass bell.

Inside a Stout Cabin~
   The interior walls and floor of this cabin are fashioned of 
smooth, cherrywood planks. The main living area devours much of 
the bottom floor and is dominated by a simple, flagstone 
fireplace along the western wall. To the north a door is set, 
the smells of a kitchen beyond it. Along the eastern wall there 
are stairs that lead upward to a small, hinged trapdoor. The 
cabin has several large windows with heavy shutters laden with 
iron reinforcements. A similar strength is lent to the cabin's 
southern door which leads out to the cabin's yard.

northern wall, leading up to a trapdoor. While, located in the 
floor, another leads down.

for a tall man to stand up entirely here, but suitable for small 
racks and as storage for perishables. Squat stairs lead to a

Foreman's Office~
   This room seems to serve as an office, break room, and tool 
shed. It has a rather utilitarian feel. One can make out the 
black lines of tar that have sealed the gaps between planks of 
the ceiling, and there are some black globs of tar on the dirt 
floor. The stone walls are made of rough courses of river rock 
and mortar, and they are effective for keeping out the elements. 
Shuttered windows look out to the north and east, where sounds of 
construction can usually be heard.

   Dark are ground stands in stark contrast to the wild lands

Along a Blackened Stone Bridge~
   Between two slightly wider areas at both ends where gatehouses 
once would have stood, this length of stone blocks mortared 
together still stand as a sturdy bridge spanning the river below. 
Now, however, both edges open to the river some distance below, 
and, peering down, one might at times catch glimpses of the 
ruined stone which once formed the fortifications which would 
have made this bridge a formidable bastion through the waters, 
which have not yet washed away the black marks from the stones, 
just as weather and passing feet have yet to scour the marks from 
the stone underfoot.

   Teeming with shrubs and young trees, this space just outside 
the newly-build walls of a palisade fence appears to have been 
built with haste and defense in mind rather than aestethics or 
comfort. Beyond the yard further to the north sits a 
dilapidated, timeworn cottage that Arda slowly but steadily works 
to absorb, the structure of the building anything but sound with 
busted windows and a sagging, crumbling foundation.

On The Bottom Floor Of An Ancient Shack~
   Formed of wood that has slowly begun to rot away, this small 
shack is clearly in a state of decline and has been left unused 
for a great while. The dirt floor has a few scraggly plants near 
the busted out window beginning to grow up, and a handful of 
plants begin to creep through cracks in the walls. To the south, 
a broken door still barely manages to stand, allowing passengers 
south to barely slip by a space in the palisade wall only visible 
from this side. Large windows that had been set into each of the 
walls have had all the glass panes broken out; allowing a peek 
over the palisade into the yard beyond.

Upper Level Of A Decrepit Shack In Northern Ithilien~
   Worn and weathered, the upper storey of this old shack seems 
somewhat unsafe to any who stand upon the rotting wood of the 
floor. Despite the uneasy creak and give of the floor, it 
remains steadfast in spite of any misgivings. The roof above is 
spotchy and filled with holes, but the large, south-facing 
window, long missing its glass pane, provides a commanding view 
of the yard and the area of forest that surrounds the shack.

A Muddy Bank Leading To The Base Of A Natural Log Bridge~
   Here, the muddy bank is met by a thick beam of wood that has 
been pulled from the earth and fallen into position to span the 
river. This natural bridge seems to be a sturdy means of 
transportation across the flowing river below, but it does appear 
that the ascent along the bank will not allow for easy movement 
towards the log.

Amongst The Tree Branches, Below A Treehouse~
   The tightly grouped branches of this area make it easy for 
even one slightly encumbered to move about. This aged tree has 
many strong limbs branching out from its trunk, and above this 
place is a treehouse held within the confines of this mighty oak. 
The treehouse, appearing to be fairly new in its construction, is 
of a decent size and a trapdoor has been set near the trunk to 
allow access.

   This treehouse, appearing to have been fashioned recently, is

freely while remaining suitable for the storage of necessary 
supplies. To the south, there is a small doorway that leads out 
onto a series of limbs growing together closely, and near the 
trunk of the tree, there is a trapdoor placed in the floor to 
allow access to the lower part of the tree.

Among The Limbs Of A Towering Oak~
   These limbs lead out from a small door on the treehouse. 
Although these limbs allow for a great vantage point over the 
base of the tree and the bridge to the south of it, they also 
leave one exposed to the eyes of any that wander below. The path 
also seems somewhat treacherous; these limbs need be walked with 
care.

At the Base of a Crashing Waterfall~
   Natural spires of grey rock jut straight from the ground and 
surround the bottom of the majestic falls adding a cathedral like 
atmosphere. The stones are perpetually enshrouded in mist cast 
by the tumultuous waters cascading from high above. A patina of 
green grey moss decorates their crowns and their smooth sides. 
Mute sentinels, it is impossible to discern how long they have 
stood watch here, their heights far outstripping those of any 
mortal man. The grotto is narrower near the northern wall, 
gently opening up as it travels south.

   A wide tranquil pool is fed by the majestic falls apparent 
further up the narrow canyon. While the palpable thrum of the 
vast amount of water can be discerned by any near it, the waters 
of this sanctuary appear nonplussed with mere ripples and minute 
waves disturbing its surface. Flat stones, several arm spans 
wide, encircle the pool and provide easy access to the waters 
therein. The waters are dark and casual attempts to plumb their 
depths prove futile.

Inside of A Large Wooden Barn~
   Stalwart wooden walls, left unpainted and unadorned, save for 
the plaster of grey river clay to seal out stray drafts, form the 
bulk of this large barn. Though low on the walls, the stone 
foundation stretches up, the floor itself is composed of 
hard-packed earth, which lends the large confines a musty odor. 
Six roomy stalls line the sides of the barn, stretching three to 
a row, with a larger, half-walled room making up the far end from 
the barn doors, large enough to serve as storage for tack and 
equipment. Though the vaulted ceiling of the barn can be seen 
from the inside, half of it is blocked out by the stretch of 
wooden planks and beams making up the loft above, from which an 
access ladder

A Spacious Hay Loft~
   The high, vaulted ceiling of the barn forms the roof to this 
generously-sized hay loft. Over the edge, a wooden ladder 
connects the loft to the ground floor of the barn, forming a 
secure way to ascend into it's dim confines. The occasional warp 
in the planks forming the broad roof send thin beams of light to 
fall upon the thick beams and planks that have been solidly 
nailed to the barn's supports. This large space seems the 
perfect place to store piles of hay and straw, as well as other 
dry goods away from the moisture that sometimes finds its way 
into the ground floor of the barn below.

A Cramped Game Trail at the Base of a Cliff~
   The tall evergreens reach far over head and obscure the sky 
above. Their low branches force all but the smallest to crouch 
low lest they suffer a face full of pine needles. The oppressive 
silence of the surrounding forest is further compounded by the 
blank cliff face that rises to the north and the game trail which 
disappears to the south through the trees. A sense of 
claustrophobia threatens the weak of will as the trees hem in all 
around and obscures the rest of the forest.

outside elements. The walls, ceiling and floor are all of a

A Cliff Face Dominated by Lichen Grown Cracks and Fissures~
   Rising abruptly from the forest floor to staggering heights 
overhead is a grey cliff face. The edifice is festooned with 
cracks and fissures, the edges of which have been worn smooth by 
the eons. Growing from the ground and rising above the height of 
a man are intermittent tendrils of lichens and moss. The cliff 
faces the forest to the south and extends as far as the eye is 
allowed to see to the east and the west.

A Cramped Crevice Offering Shelter~
   Nestled in the crack of a mighty cliff face this small cavern 
has sheer walls and no discernible ceiling though it appears to 
provide shelter from the elements. The walls taper to a point at 
the back with a mat of pale lichen growing to the height of a 
man. It appears that this place was naturally formed. To the 
south can be seen a dense woodland that precludes visual 
penetration.

A Spacious Well Constructed Barn~
   Hard packed earth makes the floor of this barn, cow stalls 
line the southern wall, while two large doors to the east lead 
out into a clearing. A smaller door is set near the southern end 
of the barn leading into the western work shop and a wooden 
ladder leading up into the loft. The scent of earth and animals 
fills the air here.

A Series of Smuggling Tunnels Travelling Under Ithilien~
   The tunnels here lead around root and stone in all many 
directions. Some head quickly to concealed exits into Ithilien 
near the river that stretches east from Arradoc. Some are 
further northwards, either coming out at the base of hills, in 
deep forest or down dips near the mountain edge. There are 
several hollowed out rooms for storage of smuggling goods, but 
there is not enough room for horses or wagons to pass.

Onwards you go in a boat, rowed across a river and entering the domain of Lord Andir of the bastard Gondorians. There you are carefully moved from place to place under cover of wagons and forests, the land sparsely patrolled. Eventually you reach a small dock south of East Osgiliath and onto a boat you go. Ropes are pulled, rows are sunk into the river and slowly you are pulled across the broad river to West Osgiliath and to a hidden mooring point under the ancient dockyards at the south end of the ruined city of Fallen Stars. Out you step with your cargo.

A Stone Bridge where a Gatehouse Once Stood~
   This flat stone bridge bears the marks of time: still 
blackened by some old fire, the bridge is mostly clear of debris, 
now, but about the edges, a low square of blocks still rise, not 
high, and chipped in places, but still a clear marker of where 
the gatehouse once stood, just as the lack of them in the centre 
of the north and south faces indicates the gates which once might 
have barred the path. The stone underfoot seems to have been set 
in place to last, the sturdiness of the structure seemingly 
unchanged by the passing of the additions above.

A Formerly Fortified Site Before the Bridge~
   The ground, or floor, lined with stone blocks, is perfectly 
flat, lowered perhaps a foot from the level of the bridge to the 
north which it sits before. A few stones still protruding from 
the ground indicate that once, a defensive structure stood here, 
but now, the stone, once smooth, bears the marks of weapons not 
yet worn smooth by time, and scorch-marks and (in at least one 
place) dried blood show. The debris of the tower's fall has 
since been cleared from the area, but the slopes of the riverbank 
on either side of the bridge are littered with bits of the 
remains.

Gentle Waters Under the Ancient Dockyards of West Osgiliath~
   Quietly slapping against the crumbling granite wall on the 
west side of this landing platform, the river of Anduin is tamed. 
Clearly built many centuries ago, this smuggling dock comprises 
simple lashed-logs upon wooden pillars. It is positioned 
directly under one of the longer docking areas where once great 
ships would pull in to unload their goods to the citizens and 
Vanguard of Osgiliath. Now, deserted and forgotten, the steps 
that hug the western wall lead to an old hatch, with a sliding

Outside A Dilapidated, Abandoned Cottage~
   Cleared of any larger trees, Ithilien's flora still pushes 
forward to reclaim the yard before this decrepit building. Young 
trees and shrubs dominate the yard, assaulting the very structure 
of the house, in an attempt to completely reclaim this old 
cottage. Fashioned from wood long ago, the core of the cottage 
rotted away some time in the past, leaving the determined, yet 
unsteady building to resolutely fend off the approaching forest. 
A newly built wooden palisade surrounds the ramshackle structure, 
providing some further support and containment, while friendly 
forces might #6hail#0 a #6guardian#0 inside for safe passage.

A Dank Underground Trail Winding Southward~
   The damp floor and steep walls of this underground trail are 
soft and loamy soil, packed well enough to maintain the area's 
structure but occasionally crumbling here and there. Roots 
decorate the ceiling and an ancient, deep earthen smell fills the 
area. To the east, north, and west are dead ends, and though a 
slight opening can be seen directly above, the walls are too 
slick and crumbly and the ceiling too high to reach. This path 
meanders southward for a stretch well beyond sight, disappearing 
into the dark.

A Long, Narrow Underground Trail~
   The air in this long, dark tunnel that winds from north to 
south is heavy and damp, but cool. The dark, rich soil that 
comprises the ceiling, walls, and floor muffles most sound, but 
the chittering and skittering of small insects and creatures can 
be heard disrupting the silence.

Winding, Narrow Underground Trail~
   Roots from the ancient forest above poke through the earthen 
ceiling of this narrow tunnel, climbing down the loamy walls and 
even hanging down into the path at times, coated in old-looking 
spider silk. The tunnel meanders southward into the dark and to 
the north opens into a yawning underground cavern.

A Bend In An Underground Trail~
   Here, the trail bends from north to east, leading farther on 
into the darkness. The loamy soil underfoot becomes a bit 
firmer, and the air a bit cooler here despite the claustrophobic 
space.

An Underground Trail Leading West and South~
   The bend turns sharply back toward the south here, leading on 
and on toward the south in a narrow, enclosed path, roots jutting 
out from the ceiling and walls, creating a home for the crawly 
critters that live there.

A Long Underground Trail Opening Into A Low Cavern~
   The darkness and dankness of the underground trail that leads 
into this cavern makes it nearly impossible to tell how long the 
tunnel actually takes to travel. Once it does finally reach the 
cave, it only opens in width, its ceiling remaining low, though 
the soil hardens above into something much rockier and more 
solid. The ground begins to slope upward at the eastern end of 
the cavern toward a small opening through which two average-sized 
humans could squeeze themselves at once.
