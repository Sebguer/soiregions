a loathsome, hairless giant-spider~
A loathsome, hairless giant-spider crawls across the rock.~
   Strangely naked and repulsive looking, this spider appears to 
be something more than simply a larger version of its natural 
brethren. Its hide is thick and leathery, and glistens slightly 
with slime. Its head glistens with baleful eyes, which are 
surrounded by coarse black hairs. It is, perhaps, as large as a 
pony, and may weigh well over a hundred pounds.

A large, wrinkle-faced bat clings to the wall.~
   The wingspan of this bat is well over two feet, a curving claw 
hooked from each tip. Its body is covered with bristly, brown 
fur, while the wings are a leathery black. Wrinkles and folds 
hang from its face, and a pair of sharp fangs and beady black 
eyes complete the visage.

   A hulking, malevolent presnce, this monstrous creature towers 
over a dozen feet high. It is a spider in form, but seems a 
great deal more, with barbed horns protruding from its massive 
head that glisten with the baleful light of hundreds of clustered 
legs which support it. The skin of its belly is thick and 
wrinkled, and glows slightly with a soft, green, luminescence. 
Its entire body bristles with spike-like hairs, and stinks of a

A spiderling skitters rapidly across the ground, dodging this way and that.~
   Covere with coarse little hairs, this spider moves quickly
and erratically, making it difficult to follow as it moves around.
It is about the size of a large mans hand with the fingers spread
out, and has a pair of very obvious mandibles.

An enormous beast with thick, brown hide and curving tusks looms here.~
   This huge, dark brown animal appears to be a combination of 
power and muscle, its four thick, pillar-like legs and serpentine 
nose rippling with raw strength. Its skin is wrinkled and dotted 
with fine hairs, and its eyes are an inky black. On either side 
of its oddly small mouth protrtrude two long, yellowish tusks, 
curved forwards and ending in deadly points. The creature's feet 
are flat and apparently toeless, and a thin tail hangs behind it. 
Its ears are larger than its head, making to the sheer size and 
bulk of the massive animal seem even more pronounced.

A lithe, pale man with white pupils stands here.~
   With short black hair and striking eyes, this lithe man's 
sharp features betray a numenorean heritage. His dark hair is 
contrasted drastically by his skin, pale as the purest snow. 
Dark rings surround his eyes, set back deep into his skull. The 
iris contains no color, both eyes a milky white hue. Strange 
shadows seem to pass across his body, disappearing from view if 
one stares directly at him.

A massive, black-winged beast with a long, curving snake-like head is perched here.~
   This creature at first glance would appear to be a miniature 
replica of the dragons of old, but its small head with beady 
black-eyes and its entirely black hide would tend to indicate 
otherwise. Its body is thick and solid and it is much larger in 
size then the largest of horses. Black, leathery flesh covers 
the beasts hide at closer examination and it lacks the scales of 
other reptiles. The creature has no front arms, but instead two 
powerful back legs upon which hang massive talons that could 
easily kill a man.

from the long head of the snake, contracting now and again to 
thin slits. From its large mouth, two huge fangs stick out, 
dripping with saliva and stained reddy-yellow. Its body is thick 
and muscular, over a meter in diameter, and its length stretches 
at least twenty meters to a sharp, whip like tail.

auto-create barrow wight sentinel~
An auto-create barrow wight sentinel stares about in hatred.~
   Layers of torn, rotting flesh have been stretched over this 
skull-like mask in a twisted snarl. Dead eyes stare out from 
behind bags of corpulent skin searching about for prey in one 
form or another. Long, frail looking pale arms reach out with 
bony fingers topped by withered, blackened nails. This wight was 
obviously human at one time, but it is clear from its rotted 
composure, fetid breath and blackened teeth that it has long 
since found its way into the grave.

A monstrous spider hunches here on its eight barbed legs.~
   Easily the size of a healthy draft horse, this spider is of 
absolutely monstrous proportions for such a creature, its long, 
bulky legs covered in knife-length barbs that glisten black. Its 
heavy, bloated midsection is covered in a shiny black carapace, 
overlaid with a short, spiky layer of what appears to be a 
bristly kind of fur. Eight dull red eyes flick about at the top 
of the spiders head, set above a massive collection of fangs.

spider gargantuan spindle baleful-eyed~
a spindle-limbed, gargantuan spider~
A spindle-limbed, gargantuan spiders glares about with a dozen baleful eyes.~
   The tall, precariously thin legs of this spider rise up taller 
than most men, sinking down to rest its small body. Despite the 
almost skeletal gauntness of this immense beast, it moves with 
whipcrack motion, skittering almost effortlessly over anything in 
its path. A dozen overly large yellow eyes glare out from atop 
its head, set right above a set of sword-blade length teeth.

a colossal, bloated spider~
A colossal, bloated spider, covered in bristly fur, lurks here.~
   This colossal, bloated spider lurks close to the ground, yet 
at a guess would easily weight over two hundred pounds, its 
articulated legs fat and bulky, the huge midsection and head of 
the spider adding to the sheer weight of this monstrous creature. 
Despite its corpulent form, this spider moves with an eerie grace 
and speed, often rearing up on its hind eight legs to strike 
forth with the pincer-like teeth arrayed at the front of its 
mouth.

a small auto-create spider~
A small auto-create spider skitters about here.~
   The multiple, unnerving eyes of the monstrous spider show no 
hint of emotion as it crawls silently among the rocks and loose 
boulder. It weighs perhaps forty pounds, and is some five feet 
across. Utterly silent as it slowly moves, this spider is 
perhaps the size of an average dog. Most of its size comes from 
its legs, which radiate some two feet from its body.

A slimey skinned, bulbous eyed orc looks about nervously.~
Moss green skin covers this orc from head to toe, the
texture and appearance of the skin much like that one would
expect to see on a frog. a hairless head and body, with large
bulbous eyes, spaced widely apart with almond black slivers
for pupils lend to the appearance. His nose is rather flat,
appearing to have been broken many times and his limbs are
gangly, hands ending in stubby, fat fingers.

A massive, heavily muscled, scaled troll lumbers about.~
Massive and tall, even by trollish standards, this troll
is covered by a thick hide of scaled skin, the muscles of his
arms bulge, causing some of the scales to point outward, like
little spikes along his arms. His head is malformed and lumpy,
and his eyes are small, giving him the appearance of constantly
squinting at things, as his dull black pupils move about. His
gut hangs out in a disgustingly large pot belly and his legs
are thickly muscled and covered in the same scales that cover
the rest of his body.

A hairy, blue skinned troll lumbers about.~
It seems hard to tell from first glance, but it appears that
this particular troll is female. Long, green hair is matted
against her skull. Her eyes are a dull grey-green, while her
flesh is the blue-ish color of a corpse that has spent a long
period of time in water. Thick veins can be seen against her
blue membrane-like skin, while her arm muscles bulge, covered
in a thick black body hair. Her legs are short for a troll,
but at the same time, they are quite well muscled for carrying
her considerable mass about.
