An elegant, vine-shaped gold ring set with a ruby lies here.~
   Elegantly crafted, the band of this slender ring was made to 
resemble a trio of vines twining about each other. Several tiny 
leaves, set with slivers of emerald and accented with veins of 
gold adorn the band. Almost lifelike in their detail, the vines 
twist up at the top of the ring, grasping a fat, brilliant red 
ruby. Catching and reflecting light with its many facets, the 
stone gleams resplendently in its setting.

darkening agent, lending a rich, deep color to the metal and 
bringing out the tiny accents.

thick iron which has been blackened. Fashioned from three panels 
riveted together with a low dome top, the visor of the piece has 
slits from where the mouth would be and a long vertical slit up 
to where the nose would be. There are two eye-holes in the piece 
as well, and the inside of the helm has been padded with fur to 
avoid painful jolts to the head, as well as for comfort. The 
helm is sturdy and, though seeming slightly crude, it looks as 
though it would hold together well.

eyes open. The mane itself has been etched onto the steel, care 
having been taken to create a fair level of detail around the 
features of the large feline's head. A few languid whiskers 
protrude from the muzzle, and the eyes have also been skillfully 
rendered. Around each black line of etching gold enamel has been 
placed, emboldening each line and contour of the image.

rather pleased in each other's arms. The man in the painting has 
chestnut-hued hair and a full beard of the same color. His eyes 
are a stark sea-green and his skin is tanned, while faint scars 
can be seen on his cheek and neck. The woman is shown as having 
curly brown hair streaked with silver, and her eyes are a 
striking sky-blue. Her cheekbones are high, contributing to the 
beauty of her oval-shaped face. The background of the painting 
consists of a cherry tree trunk whose blossoms hover over the 
couple's head at the top of the painting. At the bottom right of 
the art piece there is a signature drawn in the shape of a fox's 
head carved into what appears to be a wooden die.

instrument towards the point. An angled rectangular cut has been 
gently carved into the end of the instrument, near the bulk 
opposite of the point. The point has been dulled and the horn 
has been hallowed as to allow the user the ability to, if used 
correctly, create flawless, beautiful sounding music.

   In contrast to the grey bedrock of the mountainside, this 
statue is carved of veined black marble, affixed firmly to a 
stone base. The statue depicts a regal man, his chin held high, 
his gaze resolute on the outline of a castle door carved on the 
flat face of the mountainside ahead of him. He has high 
cheekbones, a straight nose, his lips set with determination. He 
is carved with ornate armor, a cape flowing behind him marked 
with the White Tree of Gondor. He holds a shield at the ready on 
his left arm, his right tipping a longsword forward in a gesture 
of challenge. At the base of the statue it reads in Westron, 
perfectly carved in Numenian-Tengwar sigils, "King Earnur strides 
to the gates of Minas Morgul, going forth to face the Witchking 
of Angmar in single combat."

statue of a raven looks almost as lifelike as those in the skies 
above. The bird stands about three feet in height, its back 
hunched up as its curved wings spread to the sides, spanning from 
one edge to the other of the wide doorframe. Its beak is carved 
open in a raucous caw, it's eyes red with embedded stone, glaring 
down at the area before the doorway it guards. Individual 
feathers are outlined, by the craftsman, textured as if ruffled 
up from the bird's back.

   Standing almost seven feet in height, this white marble statue 
has been carved with exquisite care, depicting a man who in life 
would have been handsome enough to take the breath away. He has 
high, noble features, perfectly symmetrical, his hair carved in 
thick, cascading waves back from his face. His eyebrows arch in 
a self-assurance above a thin, slightly haughty smirk. Though 
carved in ornate plates of armor, the size of his frame implies 
the power housed within. His hand bears a longsword pointed 
downward at a lazy angle, its point resting by his foot, the hint 
of liquid carved running down the blade. Engraved neatly in 
Numenian-Tengwar, it reads: Ar-Pharazon, Son of Gimilkhad King of 
Numenor, II 3319

a huge wooden donation bin~
A huge wooden donation bin looms by a wall.~
   This huge wooden bin looms waist-high on most men and is twice 
as wide. The wooden planks are thick and sturdy, and a black and 
grey flag, bearing a shield within a moon, has been tacked up at 
the corners to drape decoratively across the front. All manner 
of things are stowed inside the bin, ranging from pots of lantern 
oil to polished weaponry. Smartly dressed soldiers stand on 
stiff-backed watch beside it, and assistants constantly transfer 
the contents to a back room. 
   #6OOC: "donate war"#0 is the syntax. It will take whatever is 
in your character's hands and deposit that in the storeroom, so 
make sure you are holding what you wish to donate.

   This steel breastplate has been expertly crafted, and polished 
to a high sheen. The steel is thick and heavy, and straps onto 
the body with dark, leather straps and silver buckles. The edges 
are turned, providing a nice rounded trimwork around the 
breastplate. It provides excellent protection for the torso, 
shoulders, and back. Fine engravings cover the trimwork, written 
in a flowing, faint script.

etched into the middle.

A weathered leather pouch on a cord lies here, decorated in beads and feathers.~
   This leather pouch is quite large and is weathered by time, 
wrinkles deeply-ingrained all over the surface. A long, leather 
cord allows it to be tied shut but also is knotted at the ends to 
allow it to be draped over one's neck or worn elsewhere. Faded, 
some ancient markings can be see faintly-inked all over the 
pouch, though most are incoherent now, and the rest only half 
visible. Sewn onto the sideseams of the pouch are many wooden 
beads, their color now dull, and feathers of various sizes.

A faded forest-green cloak bearing a five-pointed star clasp is here.~
   The five pointed star at the center of this burnished clasp 
gleams brightly against the tarnished silver metal backing, 
drawing together the folds of the cloak it adorns. The cloak 
itself is full and bears a deep hood, though the fabric has seen 
many, many years, having been neatly patched in several places. 
Subtle patterns and shades have been woven in the fabric of the 
cloak, the texture blending in with most natural surroundings.

A forest green cloak adorned with a golden tree clasp lay here.~
   This full, hooded cloak is drawn together by an antiquated 
oval gilded clasp. Folds of deep forest green spill out from the 
clasp-point, the ample fabric able to shroud the wearer and 
muffle their movement. A subtle pattern of differing shades of 
greens and browns has been woven into the cloak-fabric, blending 
into most natural locations. The clasp itself is of fine 
craftsmanship, the burnished metal bearing an archaic etching of 
a gleaming golden tree. The metal surrounding the tree is of a 
different hue, and somewhat subdued.

an ingeniously constructed harness~
A harness lays here discarded, formed of many leather straps and buckles.~
   A broad leather strap, intended to encircle a person's chest, 
just above the abdomen, forms the foundation of this harness. 
From this first belt-like section of leather, another broad loop 
runs at right-angles, fastened with neat stitching to the front 
and back of the first. Buckles allow for adjustment to this 
strap, to enable a firm comfortable fit around the shoulder of 
the wearer. From the front of this shoulder strap extends 
another, slightly narrower piece of leather which terminates in a 
broad soft leather wristband, fitted with buckles which close it 
tightly around the wrist, and if desired, then fasten the wrist 
firmly against the body strap. In the Numenian-Tengwar script, 
the word Haleth is carefully carved onto the shoulder strap above 
the stitching.

An intricate ring of sapphires and white gold is laying here.~
   A highly untraditional piece, this ring has been designed as 
an intricate pattern of two ribbons twisted about one another. 
Each white gold swirl of ribbon turns about itself on the flat, 
the loops and twirls in the design outlining dozens of small 
channel set sapphires within it. The clarity of the ocean-blue 
sapphires stands in stark contrast to the polished face of the 
metal, the facets of the stones arranged to glitter marvelously 
with any available light. The ring has been sized for the 
slender hand of a woman.

carefully engraved. The metal has a deliberate antiqued look to 
it, the vinery and flowers polished, while the metal surrounding 
them blackened and recessed below.

cutlass UNIQUE_PGERAINT blackened blade exotic engravings basket hilt METAL~
an engraved, basket-hilted cutlass~
A cutlass with a blackened blade and exotic engravings has been dropped here.~
   The length of this weapon is just below three feet, made of 
what seems to be solid, well-worked steel. With a slight curve 
towards the tip, it has been carefully sharpened, holding a 
vicious hone, its hilt affixed solidly with rivets and wrapped in 
storm-grey leather. The hand of the wielder is protected by a 
cupped handguard, made of some type of stained brass. Engravings 
have been carefully drawn on the surface of the brass, depicting 
a fox bearing a trident below a willow tree, with what seems to 
be swirling waves around it. The weapon has a comfortable, solid 
heft and weight, and holds an excellent balance, which offers 
ease to the wielder for a wide range of motions. The darkened 
surface of the brass handguard is peer to the blade, which has 
been blackened through some process on the metal, yielding a 
matte surface that does not reflect the light. The quality of 
the metal, the engraving and complexity of the darkening, show 
the skill of the western weaponsmith that forged this piece.

axe EXPERT_QUALITY UNIQUE_PGERAINT massive engravings ravens watery steel METAL~
a raven-engraved, watery steel axe~
A massive axe with engravings of ravens has been dropped here.~
   A heavy, brutal weapon, this double-headed greataxe is a piece 
designed with fierce violence as goal. Made of fine steel, the 
metal has been polished and worked as to have a watery, slightly 
rippled appearance, forming twin crescent blades. Over the 
surface of the steel, on each face, a flight of ravens have been 
meticulously drawn. Long depressions emit from the center of the 
axe-head, both adding to the engravings and slightly lessening 
the overall weight of the weapon. The shaft is long and sturdy, 
making this axe stand half as tall as a man. The wood looks hard 
and strong, and has been wrapped in black strips of leather. At 
the end of the shaft a square of thick steel has been affixed, 
adding counterbalance to the weapon. The axehead seems to have 
been forged from one massive piece of metal, worked into the 
proper shape, which indicates this is a weapon for one both of 
great strength and a devastating, blunt style of combat.

   This tunic has been knitted from wool dyed azure in colour, 
the material reaching down to the mid-thighs and elbows while

and is of sturdy enough work and design to survive the rigours of 
everyday life. Embroidered on the right side of the breast is a 
prancing winged horse wielding a sword, the borders done in 
stem-stitch and the filled-in areas done in satin-stitch, all in 
fine white linen thread.

An azure woolen dress embroidered with a white winged horse is folded here.~
   This plain woolen dress is dyed azure, and cut to cover the 
body modestly. Several gores give it fullness. It flows from 
the neck to the ankles, with two long gores that run from under 
the armhole to the ground in flaring panels. The sleeves are 
long and fitted, with embroidered burgundy diamonds around their 
edges. Embroidered on the right side of the breast is a prancing 
winged horse wielding a sword, the borders done in stem-stitch 
and the filled-in areas done in satin-stitch, all in fine white 
linen thread.

an steel cuirass, inlaid with a bronzed eagle~
A polished steel cuirass inlaid with a bronzed white tailed eagle, lies here.~
   A finely crafted, steel cuirass has been polished to a 
high sheen. Placed over the heart is the detailed figure of 
a white tailed eagle. Enchased exquisitely in bronze, the 
white tailed eagle has its great wings spread wide, its 
wing tips reaching up along each side of the neck. Facing 
outward, the eagle's deadly talons and sharp beak are open, 
ready to rain death upon its prey. Its eyes, intense and 
intelligent, bear fine but subtle etchings of the White Tree.
Polished steel bands form articulated pauldrons that cover 
the shoulders and the upper portion of the arms. All edges
are tightly rolled and all fasteners have been enameled in
black. The straps are of tooled leather, and the inside 
surfaces are lightly padded and covered in soft deerhide.

A patchwork wolf fur cloak has been set here.~
   The black fur of this cloak is greasy and all along its 
length, one can see many patches of linen and wool. The pelts 
appear to have been quickly whipped together in a hasty fashion 
with not much care taken. It appears this cloak has been lucky 
enough to have some extra stitching added to it, as a good size 
pocket has been sewn to one front on the inside.

A patchwork tunic of dreary blue linen has been left here.~
   While the tunic's main colour seems of at least once been a 
dreary white, it has clearly had some recent patchwork done to 
it--off cuts of blue wool, and linen have been sewn in to cover 
holes and probably stains. The stitching seems to have been 
reinforced also. But overall, the garment is still shoddy, itchy 
and uncomfortable.

   Fashioned in a usable, yet not extravagent manner, this cloak 
is formed of thick wool, warm enough to protect against the 
chills of a cold night. Dyed silver grey, it reaches down to the 
ankles of its wearer, and a long, deep hood is sewn into the back 
to offer further protection from the weather. Appliqued in linen 
onto the back is a large rearing pale scarlet horse, darker 
pieces of fabric outlining the eyes, shadows of musculature, 
hooves, mane and tail in a semi-stylised manner. The stitching 
is neat and precise, done in white thread.

a steel falchion with a slender, runed blade~
A bronze-hilted steel-bladed falchion lies here~
   Consisting of a single-edged, tempered steel blade, this 
falchion's form is far from standard. The back of the blade is 
straight, yet its edged side shaped gracefully. Quite narrow at 
the crossguard, it curves sharply outward creating a jutting 
hook, then its width is gradually reduced as the curve reverses 
inward. The length between the hook and tip is narrower until it 
widens outward again near the end, allowing for battering 
strikes. Deep blood grooves run along each side, lined with 
strange runes. The crossguard is of bronze, forged in low-relief 
to depict the head of a mystical horned beast and its hilt is 
wrapped in a tooled greenish leather, worn and cracked from use. 
The pommel a clawlike hook, a small flame scratched in it.

the seams and joints of the gauntlets, sealing them. The inside of the bin 
has been generously coated in tar with special attention to the joints and 
seams. A strip of narrow, waxed deer hide runs along the top edge of the 
bin, allowing for a tight seal when the lid is closed. Heavy metal latches
have been affixed to the bin to secure the lid. Inside the bin, two small
burlap sacks have been attached to the walls.

of art as it is functional, this armor serves to offer lightweight 
protection to its wearer as well as presenting a handsome and

embossed symbol depicts a rosebud, dyed the soft red of a winter 
rose, surrounded by three tiny stars, gilded with gold foil. It wraps
around the wearer's body snugly, and is well padded on the inside 
to promote comfort and to turn away penetrating blows. The leather 
softens as it moves closer to the wearers hips and waist, allowing 
for freedom of movement.  Belt loops along the side make for excellent 
support of a belt. Along the head and armholes, rivets to allow the 
wearer to fasten a gorget and sleeves can be found.

A dress of many layers of colors and ribbons has been left here.~
   Layers upon layers of many types of cloth comprise this dress, 
the pieces of fabric those of different sorts--cotton, linen, and 
wool as well as a few here and there of silk and velvet. They 
have been sewn at various locations, making it a splash of fabric 
and bright colors from pink to yellow and blue to red and green. 
Equally varied in color and material are a multitude of thin and 
wide ribbons alike, a few boasting tiny bells or beads at the 
tips. The arrangement of the cloth pieces and ribbons together 
is such that the original sky blue color of the dress shows only 
at the snug-fitting bodice, contrasting with the yellow ties. 
Long sleeves of a sort have been layered and cut to where they 
often show the wearer's arms during movement. Despite the 
loudness and seeming disorganization of the dress, it appears to 
have been carefully hemmed and sewn in places, with no tattered 
threads or unraveling cloths.

A pair of neatly-patched pale pink leggings has been set here.~
   Made of a pale pink linen, these leggings have faded in color 
though they still seem to be well-kept and cared for. Patches of 
varying vivid colors have been neatly sewn into them with tiny 
stitches, some small while others are rather large. The 
arrangement suggests that the locations of the patching may have 
been more intentional than by circumstance.

A tarnished oval locket on a silver chain has been set here.~
   Made of a now-tarnished metal that might be identifiable with 
effort as silver, this small locket has been made in the shape of 
an oval. A tiny catch on the side permits it to be opened, 
though the space it reveals seems too small to keep any item of 
real interest. It has been suspended from a thin silver chain.

   Carved from sturdy-looking but not very expensive wood, this 
rectangular shaped box is of medium size. The depth is that to 
allow many small objects to be placed into it, and the length 
allows for those longer items as well. The lid of the box 
appears to be able to be lifted from it to expose the contents, 
often held in place by a ribbon or piece of rope.

a regal female hand-puppet~
A regal female hand-puppet has been left here.~
   This small female puppet has been made from sturdy, pale 
beige-colored fabric, which has been sewn into its design of a 
replica of the human form. The face is comprised of two grey 
button eyes, while the nose and mouth have been painted on. 
Black yarn has been sewn to the top of the head, mimicking the 
appearance of hair, and accented by a thin golden thread serving 
as a makeshift circlet. Tiny ears have been attached beneath the 
hair, while the other details such as fingers have simply been 
marked by embroidery knots. An imitation in miniature of a dark 
blue silk dress allows the puppet to remain clad, sewn to its 
form from the waist up too securely to allow for its movement. 
From the waist down, however, the fabric of the skirt is loose 
and flowing, ending at tiny black cloth slippers sewn onto its 
feet. An opening at the back of the puppet and a hollowness 
within allows for it to be controlled with one's hand.

miniature of a dark blue silk tunic and leggings allows the 
puppet to remain clad--the tunic has been sewn closely to the 
puppet to keep from it loosening, though from about the waist 
down, the fabric is loose. The leggings are closely fitted to 
the man's legs, ending at tiny black cloth slippers sewn onto its 
feet. An opening at the back of the puppet and a hollowness 
within allows for it to be controlled with one's hand.

A pair of hawk-blazoned, polished steel vambraces have been laid here.~
   Fashioned of the highest-grades of steel and in stunning, 
stylized fluidity, these vambraces are clearly born of a Master's 
hand. Lacking angles, each edge of the articulated upper and 
lower arm pieces, as well as the elbow guard, have been turned 
beautifully to provide a rounded surface capable of slipping 
blows. On the outside of each bicep a black engraving as been 
made, rendering a hawk in remarkable clarity. It's wings are 
spread and its expression fierce, with great hooked talons and a 
wicked beak. As if a final touch, the steel has been trimmed by 
polished brass, affording these pieces a pleasing flicker of 
silver and gold when in bright light.

yield to full thigh-plates, the brass-trimmed edges rounded to 
aide in the turning of blows.

inscription just below the leather wrapping reading 'HD' in the

make a formidable and vicious weapon in the right hands. Its

stained blood marring the metal. The cleaver has a sturdy, if 
not slightly weathered handle made from ironwood.

an intricate silver ring adorned with an amethyst~
An intricate silver ring adorned with an amethyst has been set here.~
   Polished to a high sheen and glinting in the light, this 
delicate silver ring is inlaid with a large amethyst of the 
deepest purple. The rounded stone is highlighted with swirls of 
dark red, and upon closer inspection one might detect a faint, 
abstract image, that of a face with a high crown, a crimson 
portrait lost in a sea of purple. On the underside of the 
slender band there are faint markings, slanted sigils of a 
miniscule proportion, almost too small to make out.

An elegant deep blue linen dress with wide hanging sleeves has been set here.~
   The deep blue linen of this dress is of good quality, as is 
the workmanship. The neck is square and low-cut, but not 
immodestly so. With a thin silken ribbon, the bodice laces up 
both the front an back to ensure an ideal fit for the wearer's 
figure. Over the hips, the material flows smoothly into a long, 
full skirt that ends just above the ground. The sleeves of the 
dress are long and flared.

a gold-embroidered, deep-backed cloak of fine black linen~
A gold-embroidered, deep-backed cloak of fine black linen has been set here.~
   Voluminous and enveloping this finely-woven cloak is made to 
be pinned broadly to the shoulders with round, engraved clasps of 
solid gold; a polished gold chain hangs between the two clasps 
over the wearers chest. Painstakingly engraved on each clasp is 
the image of a tall tree, a sun set in the trunk of the left and 
a moon on the right; surrounding the centerpiece is a swirling 
halo intertwined with a myriad of stars, artistically represented 
in the expensive metal. The cloak itself is made of the finest 
black linen and drapes far down from both shoulders to gather 
around the lower back, leaving the upper back of one who would 
wear the garment bare in the center. Starkly contrasting with 
the black of the linen is the swirling patterns of golden silk 
that run around the edges of the cloak, becoming more extravagant 
in the lower corners, extending further inwards to represent the 
branches of a tree.

a fine, forest green wool cloak trimmed with a tooled infinite knot design~
a fine, forest green wool cloak lies in a crumpled heap here.~
   Fashioned for practical usage, this cloak is formed of a fine, 
thick wool, warm enough to protect against the harsher elements 
the wearer is like to encounter. Dyed a deep forest green, it 
reaches down to the ankles of its wearer, and a long, tooled 
leather strap decorates the outer rim of the cloak. Upon closer 
inspection, the golden thread appears to follow a central line, 
with circular hoops all interlocked as they follow the central 
line along the length of the strap. The tooled, embroidered 
strap accentuates the fine quality that has gone into the making 
of this cloak, while retaining practicality of use.

cords of tough sinew. The plates are dark and lack

shirt, to rest upon the wearer's shoulders. Beneath the armor's 
exterior is a gambeson of padded felt.

bronze plates, sewn together with sinew to resemble the scales of 
a serpent. The skirt appears to be rather weighty, but 
nevertheless affords the wearer significant freedom of movement, 
as a result of its design. The plates that constitute the armor 
are plain but well-forged.

A ragged, long black coat of sable fur lies in a pile here.~
   This long coat, now ragged and fraying, is fashioned of a 
series of jet black sable pelts, carefully seamed together with 
dark thread. In spite of the age of the garment, the fur retains 
a rich, lustrous quality, a variety of paler hues shifting across 
its feathery surface as it is moved. The coat is relatively 
thin, seeming dense enough to offer warmth during the year's 
colder seasons, but not so thick as to overheat the wearer during 
a mild summer or spring. The garment is torn toward the bottom, 
its lower edges shredded and uneven.

a slender, star-in-heart-engraved harp~
A slender harp engraved with a star within a heart stands on its base.~
   This slender harp is elegant in form and carved from a 
light-colored maple wood, small enough to fit in the crook of 
one's arm though yet still large enough with a base to place it 
upon a table for play. The fluted column extends upwards at a 
slight angle, supporting the neck of the instrument where many 
brays have been set for the tuning or adjusting of each of the 
twenty-six, metal strings. The block extends far enough for a 
comfortable fit from the more severe angle of the soundboard 
where it rests against one's shoulder. There is little 
decoration to this harp, the only obvious embellishment being a 
simple carving of a star within the center of a heart upon one 
side of the sound box. Beneath the supporting base, the name 
'Meluiial' has been burned into the wood.

into a delicate braid until it tapers and smoothens out at its

the gemstone that has been set atop it. A flawless emerald cut 
with many facets burns with the brilliance of its inner, green 
fire while two ruby slivers are set to each side, flanking the 
center gemstone with their blood red color. The inside of the 
ring has been engraved with flowing script in the Westron tongue, 
'Without love, I am nothing. - Kel.'

lusterous silver standing out clearly from the solid iron behind

flute exquisite silver crystal UNIQUE_POBRIAN METAL~
an exquisite, silver and crystal flute~
An exquisite, silver and crystal flute has been put aside here.~
   Composed of two sections, this flute is artful and delicate, 
an exquisite testament to the prowess of the maker. Formed of 
beautiful silver and capped by a faceted crystal, the two 
sections slide together with such precision that it is difficult 
to detect the seam between them. Several holes set in perfect 
straightness perforate the body of the instrument, allowing the 
player to form different notes. A closer look reveals that each 
hole is rimmed with tiny, inset crystal, casting light off from 
the flute and adding to its luster. However, the true beauty of 
this instrument is in its music when played, the voice of the 
flute is a full expression of the mood of the player. Whether 
rich and warm, or soft and haunting, the body and range of sound, 
and the purity of that sound, which emits from the instrument is 
likely unmatched by any other.

a slender, unadorned arming sword~
A slender, unadorned arming sword lies here.~
   Rather plain in appearance, this sword is nonetheless composed 
of a fine, glittering steel alloy, unmarred and undimmed in 
lustre. The blade is slender and long, with a narrow fuller 
running from the hilt nearly to the tip. Acutely pointed and 
with a diamond cross-section, the sword seems designed for 
thrusting as well as cutting. Gently upswept, a crescent 
cross-guard protects the wielder's hand, while the grip is 
wrapped in a supple, royal blue leather. A silvery, wheel pommel 
adds balance to the blade, and indeed, when taken in hand, the 
blade is surpassingly nimble and deft. Unadorned by inscription 
or decoration, the true art of this blade is in its function, for 
it is a weapon crafted for war by the hands of a master possessed 
of skill beyond the hands of Men.

an exquisitely carven and jeweled culumalda crossbow~
An exquisitely carven and jeweled culumalda crossbow lies here, waiting for use.~
   The wood of a culumalda tree has been hewn to create both the 
stock and bow of crossbow, stained a pale reddish hue and 
polished until it gleams. Intricate carving of twining vinework 
graces the stock, beautifully inlaid with polished and gleaming 
faceted emeralds. The grip upon the stock is a delicately tanned 
hide of tawny softness, edged with golden threadwork. Gleaming 
golden brass provides the metal for the fittings and the ratchet. 
The elastic gut that strings the bow has been cleaned to a color 
of off-white bone. As beautiful a showpiece as this crossbow 
might be, the exquisite craftsmanship is more than mere 
aesthetic: the balance and weight are precisely designed to form 
a deadly weapon.

A shimmering gown of iridescent spiderweb and dew glistens here.~
   Delicate threads of spiderweb have been cleverly woven into 
long strands to create the fabric of this unusual gown. 
Glittering dewdrops the size of pearls accent the spiderwebs, 
clinging to the surface to create a shimmering, sparkling 
iridescence. The gown itself is ephemeral in its delicacy, the 
strands separating and coming together like fringe in an 
ever-shifting flow that shows tantalizing glimpses of the figure 
beneath without ever fully exposing it. The multitude of woven 
strands reach from shoulder to wrist, from neck to ankle, but 
every slightest movement sends the spiderwebs into motion sending 
flashes of reflective color brilliantly sparkling from the drops 
of dew.

edged in thin strands of braided silver. The stone is almost 
colorless, with a pale blue sheen that seems to float above it; 
it is not overly large, but is much wider than the band.

evident skill and attention to detail. The blade is solid, 
polished to high-sheen and fashioned with expertise, revealing no

has sharpened expertly to a near razor-fine edge. An elegant 
cross-guard made of artfully dulled bronze is set above the fine 
maple wood hilt, protecting the wielders hand and wrist from 
damage. Thin black leather thongs have been wrapped around the 
hilt, providing a secure, solid grip. Runes have been carved 
into the blade along the spine near the crossguard and appear 
somehow cryptic.

A rune-engraved pendant bearing an ocean-blue stone lay here.~
Suspended from a simple, black silk cord, this pendant features
a small, round, azure aventurine stone bearing many striations
of deep blue arranged in a pattern that resembles a roiling sea.
Several thin prongs secure it to a flat, coin-shaped setting of
polished bronze which bears strange runes engraved above, below,
to the right, and to the left of the stone.

warhammer UNIQUE_PHOAR byLEGOLIN DWARVISH_QUALITY masterfully-crafted rune-engraved steel METAL~
a masterfully-crafted, rune-engraved, steel warhammer~
A masterfully-crafted, rune-engraved, steel warhammer has been left here.~
   This steel warhammer is clearly a masterwork piece of 
weaponry. A single ingot of steel, forged into the head of a 
warhammer, one side thick and squared off like a hammer, the 
other sharp and pointed. The steel is polished and exquisitely 
well worked and tempered to a strength and durability one would 
never hazard on a long, thin sword blade. The head is 
forge-welded to a polished steel haft nearly an inch thick, the 
end wrapped in several thin strips of leather sewn together to 
provide a firm grip. Detailed, fine runes encircle either side 
of the head. One experienced with forging or wielding similar 
weapons would immediately notice its strange balance, one that 
renders it useless to any but the shortest of Men. However, in 
the hands of such an individual, provided he is incredibly strong 
and sufficiently skilled, this weapon could prove quite deadly, 
capable of wearing down and penetrating almost any armor.

ring seal fox gold UNIQUE pofEliam byTaurgalas METAL~
a gold ring engraved with a fox seal~
A gold seal ring, bearing a fox symbol on its bezel, lies here.~
   The bezel of this gold ring bears the engraving of a fox in 
profile, facing to the right with its tail held slightly up into 
the air. Where there would be a white tuft upon the tail, a thin 
etching zigzags through the engraving, splitting the tip from the 
rest of the engraved creature's fur. The whole is surrounded by 
two upraised circles, one slightly larger than the other and at 
the very bottom, between these two is the Tree of Gondor, small, 
but clearly defined. Upon the sides of the ring, are a series of 
two lines of sigils, etched in tight and delicate script. To 
those who might know them, the language is Sindarin and the 
sigils are Arnorian Tengwar.
