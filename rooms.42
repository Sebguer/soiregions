Village Market~
   This central area of the village has been set up as a market, 
tents and leather-roofed tables holding a various assortment of 
goods for sale. The ground is rocky, and some parts are set with 
ancient stones. Steep mountains rise up beyond the buildings to 
the west, and a path to the north leads towards the mines and a 
collection of large, log-framed buildings. A watchtower and 
great cedar tree rise above the village to the south west, 
casting a shadow at certain times of the day. 
   The smell of cooked food and sound of laughter can be heard 
coming from the door to the west and a wooden sign over the east 
door bears the etching of a brown horse.

Halburg's Rest Mead Hall~
   A rough building made of large logs, this big hall has been 
filled with tables and benches, simple but clean. A great 
fireplace is nestled in the western wall, providing light and 
heat when lit. Lanterns hang from the ceiling above, spaced 
evenly in the rafters to provide light to the room. Scattered 
about this area, many of the tables possess new lumber, giving 
off the odor of drying timber. Simple meals can be seen enjoyed 
by the patrons at all hours and the sounds of clanging pots and 
pans echo from behind the curtained doorway to the north.

Well-kept Stables~
   This stable has been built out of a simple, log-framed 
longhouse. Laid out in three sections, one area has been built 
with stalls for horses and mules, one packed with hay and some 
tools and a third one that holds a fireplace and some simple 
bunks, making it possible for a stablehand to sleep with the 
animals all around the year. The whole place is neat, simple and 
clean. 
   A large double-door leads out to the west, almost as wide and 
as high as the longhouse itself.

North End of Market~
   This edge of the market seems sparsely populated, the main 
foot traffic moving away from this crossroads quickly. The 
ground is rocky, set with ancient stones that have been cut away 
by weather, time and wagon wheels, two ruts leading in north 
towards the mines and south to the rest of the village. Ancient 
ruins cling to a steep mountain rise that looms to the west, 
creating the best possible barrier of defense. 
   A path can be seen winding its way up the mountain to the 
west, leading towards a collection of longhouses, and to the east 
stands the gate leading out of the village.

Village Market South~
   The ancient stones that support this open area of ground have 
been worn and chipped with time. Most of the surrounding 
landscape is still an overgrown old ruin with bushes and small 
trees, a crossroad of broad paths strewn with cut stone from the 
mine cutting through so that wagons can pass easily in all 
weather. A great cedar tree rises to the west, casting its 
shadow on the tiny village in the early morning hours each day. 
   Metallic clangs and frantic shouts resound from the heavy door 
to the east, and a well-traveled path leads towards the 
palisade's south wall.

Village Gate~
   Inside of the large wooden gates leading outside it is close 
to the market and main square of the tiny village. In the near 
southwest there can be seen an great cedar tree and an much 
smaller watchtower. The ground consists of a mixture of dirt, 
old square shaped and ancient stones and broken stone from the 
mine that here and there carries traces of dark ore. The gates 
themselves are sturdy made from wooden logs with a simple design, 
and set in a palisade from the same material that rises on the 
east side. 
   To the south, a small, dirt yard with a gathering of caravans 
can be seen. To the north looms a courtyard leading up to a 
tower, guarded by an iron gate. A simple iron bell on a hemp 
rope stands against the iron gateway.

Village Blacksmith~
   A wide wooden building on a foundation of stone, the village 
blacksmith's shop is a gathering point for many people. Kept in 
constant light by sconces upon the wall, resources and products 
are constantly changing hands in this place. On the walls hang 
nail pouches and picks and shovels. Even the occasional weapon 
or armor may be present in this shop of trade materials, so one 
could likely #6ask#0 about #6keys#0 as well. The floor is naked 
stone, laid long ago by other inhabitants. Marks of wear and 
moss have taken root on this floor and there are fairly large 
spaces in between the slabs of stone that have been filled with 
mud, stone shards, and some vegetation. 

A door to the north leads deeper into the building, and a door to 
the west heads directly onto the busy market square. To the 
south stands another door, leading into an open area filled with 
communal ovens and a forge.

Inside the Gatehouse~
   Nothing more then a muddy square between the inner and outer 
gates, this gatehouse are framed in by a sturdy wooden palisade 
and the well-traveled ground have been strewn with a rich amount 
of stone-shards to allow wagons to pass without getting stuck 
even in bad weather. The gates themselves are made from logs and 
hangs on metal hinges, extra sliding bars in the shape of freshly 
cut logs is leaning towards a nearby wall and can be added on the 
front gate as reinforcement in case of an assault - making it not 
much easier to break down the gate then it would be to break in 
the palisade itself.

Moving Closer to a Downward Sloping Ramp~
   One of the most worked places in the city, where tons of earth 
and stones from the old ruins have been shifted aside to form 
great heaps that rest against the sturdy wooden palisade in the 
north and more recent hills of cut stone and rejected low-quality 
ore. A large gaping hole leads down into the depths of the 
mountain along a ramp wide enough to take a ox-drawn wagon. Most 
times there are work going on here, voices and feet echoing from 
the mine and loads of ore being pulled or carried to the surface. 
There is a wooden ramp to climb in order to gain access to the 
top of the palisade, and to the south lies the gate and the 
village market.

Mountain Stream Near Palisade ~
   Coming from the west where a cold mountain pool lies between 
some cottages, a mountain stream floats friskily through a 
stone-laid trench and exits westwards from the village beneath a 
hole dug under the palisade. A few young trees have been left 
near the stream, and washing buckets and animal traps tied to 
leather cords dangle into the water. 

The village market begins a ways to the north, and to the east 
the shouts of traders can often be heard day and night. #2Some 
painted cottages#0 sprout up here, following along the stream.

Beneath The Great Cedar Tree~
   This area of the village is dominated by a cedar tree of 
mammoth proportions, the ground surrounding it left as an image 
of the past civilization that might have lived here. Harsh hill 
vegetation surrounds a short piece of withered stone wall that 
stands near the cedar, slowly eroding away. The tree itself 
towers over everything else in the village, branches expanding to 
provide protection from the weather and shade all year round. A 
collection of wooden tables have been arranged around the area, 
moved out of the way of the main paths. 
   The smell of cooked food and sound of laughter can be heard 
coming from the door to the north and paths branch off in all 
other directions.

Pallisade Ramp~
   This wooden construction rises up from the west up to the 
palisade that surrounds the tiny village. The broad ramp is 
sturdily constructed by logs and wide enough to accommodate a 
four-horse wagon even though such a thing never would fit up on 
the palisade itself. To the west one can see the entrance to the 
mines, and in the south-west a great cedar tree and a watchtower 
rises inside the village borders. South-east one can from the 
right position look down into the guardhouse that holds the inner 
and outer gates, as well with a running start perhaps jump down 
into it - something that would mean a fall of about two 
full-grown men's lengths.

Cottages At The Mountain Pool~
   An idyllic scenery lies on the edge of the tiny village, a 
fairly big pool of water that is fed by a mountain stream is 
surrounded with a few handfuls of #2 painted cottages.#0 Most of 
it is left to grow wildly, but a few paths have been cleared and 
filled out with stones from the mine. The pathways are made up 
by mostly stone carrying some small amounts of dark iron ore, or 
shards from breaking way through the rock to reach new seams. 

To the east the stream leaves the pool, continuing through the 
village towards a large longhouse set slightly above the ground. 
Paths branch to the north and west towards other dwellings.

of activity, this area seems to serve as a feeder between the

Clearing Before a Pair of Shops~
   As the town tapers off, this area has been set up against the 
mountain, one of the two shops flanking this clearing nestled in 
the rock's embrace. The presence of laborers is common at many 
hours of the day and one might always expect this clearing to be 
filled with some form of commotion. 
   Doors to the north and west lead into shops. Back to the east 
a large cedar tree casts shadow on the town at all hours of the 
day.

Commons Inside a Sturdy Watchtower~
   Built on the base of a ruined building, this room carries 
ancient stone walls over a meter thick and a more recent stone 
pillar have been raised in the center of the room to ensure the 
stability of a stone ceiling that in parts came from the original 
building - but the old worn stones have been replaced in many 
places by freshly cut grey stone. The repair and reuse of the 
old ruin, especially the floor as it been patched with bricks and 
covered in hay and smelling herbs, are a very fine accomplishment 
of both craftsmanship and improvisation. Half the room has been 
closed off as a room to the west with a sturdy oak door and a 
stone stair upwards. To the north are the large double-doors set 
in the stone wall, that lead out from the tower. West is the 
kitchen, and the infirmary is to the east.

Spacious and Rustic Watchtower Barracks~
   Set on a stone base, here the tower turns into a sturdy 
construction made of thick logs that is used as the Watchers' 
main barracks. On the west wall is hung a large linen banner, 
worn with age, but still proudly presenting the white tree and 
the stars on a pale green background. Bunks are arrayed evenly 
in rows, with footlockers at the end of each and there are 
several shelves and war-trophies along the walls. A door leads 
east to the officers' barracks and a stone stair goes down to the 
ground level

Inside A Dreary Tent~
   An very old tent, whose patched sides slope inwards in an 
ominous manner are set up as a small store with trinkets hanging 
from thin horizontal wooden poles, a small table with some 
bottles and bandages, and a steady wooden bunk that while being 
fairly clean carries marks of both saw and blood - signs of a 
healers occupation that not even the most diligent rag can 
erase. A small leather drape hangs in the most inner parts of 
the tent, yielding a section where a person could stand with 
relative privacy. There are quite a lot of arcane paintings and 
strange pieces of bone, amulets and aging feathers that have been 
tied to the leather canvas - on the floor are set a few thick fur 
rugs where one is not most likely to tread.

Storage Room Beneath a Dreary Tent~
   This space, set into the river-rock foundation of the tent 
above has simple planks to provide walls, their surface often 
marred with moisture from the water-laden ground of this marshy 
land. Chalk, inks of various kinds, and something uneasily 
similiar to blood provide a wide variety of sigils and shapes on 
the boarding, while feathers, bones, and some bits of plantlife 
hang from the ceiling in various spots. Overall, the room has a 
close, odd herbal smell, but provides a strange kind of peace.

South-West Corner Of Village Palisade~
   The sturdy palisade that are surrounding the tiny village in a 
protective wooden embrace are set a ledge that allows the 
defenders to look out over the surrounding lands while still 
being in some cover from any hostile archers. To the north a 
sharp rise of the mountain obscures sight, and eastwards lies the 
small outpost - a wooden watchtower leaning against the palisade 
there allows access to the village. Where ever the eyes can see 
southwards are wilderness, and a few mud paths that traverse the 
cliffs and vegetation.

Palisade South-East Of Outpost ~
   Made up from logs that in some cases are as broad as a man, 
the log palisade stands like a border between the untamed 
wilderness and the tiny village - near the top are made a ledge 
stabilised by supporting beams where it allows passage north and 
west along the wooden wall. Some barrels, sandbags and crates 
are stacked in the corner. Over the edge one can see some 
distance into the surrounding lands, mostly a craggy and hard 
landscape that carries a free-spirited beauty that are only 
marked by men from mud paths that passes through like small 
insignificant lines through the landscape.

Up On The Palisade~
   A sturdy ledge is set here to allow traversing the palisade 
from north to south, passing over the gatehouse that holds the 
two sets of heavily reinforced log gates allowing access to the 
small outpost in the west. To the east lies rocky wilderness, 
and far to the east more forest and a glimpse of some standing 
monolithic stones placed in a rough circle among the vegetation. 
Set here is a simple wooden crane with levers, allowing to hoist 
heavy things from the inside up on the palisade ledge. The 
palisade is well-built and higher then might be seen as 
necessary, the rough beauty of its surrounding landscape is 
hardly threatening.

A Bend Along the Village Wall~
   The path southwards from here is made up of logs cut from 
mighty trees, dragged here and planted deep into the ground. To 
the west, a freshly-repaired section of palisade connects this 
ledge with another older ledge that follows the length of the 
village wall. Here, the view of the wilderness and the Misty 
Mountains that exist beyond the walls of the village is 
breathtaking, and sometimes a village can be found here looking 
out to the world beyond. The palisade wall here has been covered 
in almost its entirety with the treated hides of many animals, 
including bears, wolves, foxes and moose. They are firmly 
latched onto the wooden walls protecting the village with copious 
amounts of iron nails. Sconces sit high up on the outside of the 
wall, their burning oil providing dim illumination in the darkest 
hours of the night.

The Ledge Of The Palisade~
   Supporting itself against the steep mountain rise in the west, 
this well-built palisade of meter thick logs forms a defensive 
barrier against any threat to the tiny village. South of the 
palisade lies some old ruins that lead on to the sturdy log 
buildings that make up the outpost. On the stone wall, readable 
at eyes height for one standing on the ledge, are cut some runes 
in the mountain's grey rock. 
   To the east, a freshly built section of palisade wall connects

Outside Palisade Gates~
   Amongst the rugged wilderness of the mountain are set a 
powerful log palisade made from large trees that are mostly from 
Cedars, it is tall and the logs that in some places are a meter 
across are firmly set deep into the stony ground. The gates are 
thick, and reinforced with plenty of iron - with massive hinges. 
The wooden wall encircles a fairly small area and leans against 
the western steep rise of the mountain side to the west, in all 
other directions there are more rugged hills and exposed rock 
with patches of forest where the soil had chance to gather and 
not been washed away by rain and thaw. Two small mud paths runs 
north and south, even with scattered stones strewn on the 
pathways it is clear that they are hard to travel by wagon in 
some seasons. There are some few remains of some old stone 
buildings here, only the floor and perhaps a few stones of the 
walls remain, as does a vague stone road leading eastwards since 
many centuries overgrown and shattered by trees and bushes.

Along An Ancient Road~
   Creating fairly flat passage through the rocks, and rough 
terrain - the remains of an ancient stone-laid road goes from the 
west and leads eastwards before more or less disappearing below 
soil and vegetation. In all directions are a grim and beautiful 
wilderness, where the mountain rock is revealed amongst crooked 
trees and struggling plant life. To the west can be seen a 
wooden palisade where the mountains side rises abruptly upwards, 
and there is heavier forest northwards in a deep pocket of the 
cliffs where trees had a chance to grow big. A series of small 
holes beneath the roots of some dead old stubs tell tales of an 
extended old nest belonging to some kind of animal. 
   Sometimes, a single northman wanderer passes through this area 
of the wilderness. Sometimes, it is a whole group of northfolk, 
making their way either to or away from the smoky signs of a 
village to the west.

Rugged Mountain Slope~
   Bare rock and small twisted vegetation gives way for rocky 
hills as the terrains slopes downwards from west to east, some 
patches of forests can be seen in the north and the rise of the 
mountains lies westwards. In the east on the even crest of a 
hill and yet sheltered by surrounding higher cliffs - covered in 
vegetation lies a circle of standing stones whom are clad in a 
white thin fog. The land is richer here in these hills then in 
the more mountainous terrain further westwards, and the soil is 
deeper, and while they are sparse and few the existing trees 
manage to stand straighter and taller. A small cairn, or heap of 
stones are placed on the highest hill the eye can see.

Forsaken Stone Circle~
   Set within a semi-circle of greyish, moss-covered boulders 
that reach twice the height of the common man, this area is 
strewn with rocky debris and scrubby brush. The stone sentinels, 
set at regular intervals seem a pittance when measured against 
the majesty of the mountain rising to the west, though are, in 
reality quite massive, their bases plunging an unknown depth into 
the earth to set them solidly in place. The narrowest of gaps, 
framed by scrub brush leads downwards and is just visible to the 
discerning eye between two of the enormous stone sentries. 
Before the southron hill a flagstone of mammoth proportion has 
been laid flat within the earth, its surface blanketed with a 
thick, spongy moss which is parted by a meandering, well-trod 
path. Beyond the flagstone the trail winds its way along a 
hillock of jagged rock and earth. The way appears treacherous.

   A small oval room set in the earth and stone, with two large 
blocks of grey stone as a low roof. Its a wet and earthy smell 
in the air, cold seems to have gathered here and regardless of 
season the burrow feels icy cold. Walls have been broken through 
by roots and small green plants grow on the floor stretching 
towards the entrance during the summer. On a flat stone, marking 
the northern wall is a large crude chipped resemblance of a coast 
with burning ships and a few stick-men that seems to be glowing 
by the lines extending from their simplistic forms.

Along A Small Path Through The Misty Mountains~
   Perhaps once a road through the cliffs and patches of brushes 
and bent trees, this small path is sometimes barely visible and 
on occasion displays a stretch that is both flat and wide with 
laid stones or a side marker in the form of a raised stone with 
some now worn down and unreadable carving that would give 
directions to the people that once inhabited these lands. Rocky, 
wild and beautiful with the majestic mountains rising to the west 
into the sky - the lowland and a thin blue line as the great 
river Anduin visible in the distant east at a clear-skied day.

Muddy Path West Of A Forest~
   Earth is gathered to the east in a gigantic pocket on the 
mountainside. Enough soil to support thicker vegetation, thinner 
amounts of various kinds of trees give way to some enormous 
cedars further in to the east - visible only by their crowns that 
rises above the other trees. To the west the ever-present 
mountain rises as an impenetrable barrier to anyone that lacks 
wings. A fairly straight path, that here due to the soil grows 
more muddy traverse the still rocky and mountainous terrain north 
and south. There are markings and scars in the landscape, where 
trees have been cut, and drag marks that in some places are half 
a meter deep goes from the east to the south.

Mountainous Trail Near A Patch Of Forest~
   This path leads extends both north and south, at places 
growing nearly invisible where vegetation and the rocky ground 
melts it with the surrounding landscape. At a patch there is a 
larger spot of cleared ground where the path has been laid across 
a circular shaped setting of flat stones, laid surely as the 
foundation for some building long ago - any other traces of the 
original construction washed away by the relentless waves of 
time. To the east lies the beginning of a light forest which 
grows thicker and spurts larger cedars further away.

Following Along A Mountain Path~
   Stretching north into the mountains and hills past a light 
forest on the east side - this path whom also leads south is a 
vague lead across cliffs, scrawny vegetation and uneven terrains 
made up from bare rock and what soil that managed to stay on in 
crags and notches of the mountains bones. A gathering of shrubs 
and bushes grow on the side of the path, reaching a man to his 
waist and among them are a breed of wild roses. They cling low 
against the ground for protection and spout with small reddish 
thorns.

Path Bending East And South Past A Light Forest~
   Where the forest ends on the east side of the path, the 
terrain northwards becomes even more rugged and the cliffs 
steeper, the path curves gently eastwards to travel along terrain 
more akin to rocky hills. The moist climate of these mountains 
create much vegetation where ever it can grow, as the majestic 
giants of stone in the west catch much precipitation and moisture 
from the windy skies. On the higher ground before the road 
reaches downwards into the hills, there is a very good clear line 
of sight to the north-east on a clear day and the far-reaching 
forests of Lorien can be seen that borders even further away in 
the east to the great river Anduin herself which runs like a blue 
line north to south in the distance.

Curving Path Through Rocky Hills~
   This vague path through the uneven terrain swerves gently from 
north to west, with a larger patch of forest clinging to the 
mountain slope southwards, and rocky hills to the east. The path 
proceeds onwards, staying to a fairly straight course where the 
upwards and downwards slopes would not be unbearable for a wagon. 
At places sharp eyes can notice some short stretches that hold 
age-old efforts to make a path possible to travel where a rise 
have been cut even, or a hole that would be waist-deep in mud 
during the spring have been filled up with stones.

Among Hills Near Apple Trees~
   In the rocky hills with the mountains looming on the western 
horizon, and some light forest to the north grows a small 
gathering of apple trees in a sheltered hollow. They are not 
tall, and their limbs are somewhat gnarled and bent from the 
elements but yet they hold their ground protected by a few big 
rock formations and a flat standing stone with runes are placed 
among their midst. The grounds gradually leads downwards to the 
east, into more rocky hills and a harsh yet beautiful and vital 
landscape that far away ends in some grassy plains and the great 
river Anduin far yonder.

Palisade At The Foot Of Majestic Mountains~
   A tall wooden palisade made from heavy logs that been well 
secured deep into the rocky ground rises in the south as a half 
circle to enclose a small encampment where a watchtower and a 
great Cedar tree are revealing themselves over the upper edge. 
The palisade is set against a steep rise of the mountain side to 
the east, that goes on northwards to prevent passage for anyone 
born without feathers and a beak. The land here is rocky and 
mostly made from big cliffs, boulders and the bare bones of the 
mountains. Some vegetation such as plants, bushes and small bent 
coniferous trees struggle for an foothold in the harsh beauty of 
these lands in the shadow of the majestic mountains. 
   A section of the palisade wall has been collapsed. The rubble 
from it has been pulled away from the ruins, effectively removing 
any easy means to climb up to the splintered battlements above.

Vague Path Amidst A Rocky Landscape~
   The road is almost disappearing for a good stretch, where 
bushes have grown and mud that travelled with the spring floods 
have filled over the slopes and stretches. Yet the old path can 
still be followed north and south across the uneven and rocky 
hills. With a lot of humidity in the air that been gathered from 
the nearby majestic mountains in the west, and the annual spring 
floods that cut small streams across the landscape - the hills 
here are exceptionally lush and vital even with its harsh soil 
and abundance of stone and cliffs. In a deep crag near the road 
grows an ancient cedar, dead since many years, yet standing 
proudly to stretch its naked branches to an swindling height 
where many old bird nests lies.

Following Path Across Uneven Terrain~
   The majestic mountains rise not far in the west, and here a 
foot and wagonpath cuts across the landscape going north and 
south. Broken through the hills in some places, and there are in 
places ancient laid stone revealed that tells the tale of a more 
glorious past for this pathway through the hills. Cliffs and 
boulders rise across the terrain where many breeds of vegetation 
cling to the places where fertile soil have been gathered - small 
gnarled trees, bushes, moss, grass and plants of different types. 
A deep trench lined cuts across just to the south here, sharp 
palisade stakes pointing northward, dividing all that is north, 
west, and east from a cleared construction site that lies beyond.

A Cliff Face Over A Ravine~
   Part of this hill has fallen away, leaving a sheer cliff of 
bare stone exposed like bone in a grievous wound. Water leaks 
from the stone, bleeding into the ravine below. A treacherous 
road leads along the upper rim turning to go past the ravine 
closer to the mountains, perilously close to the edge at times. 
To the west, mountains jut into the sky. The rugged hills 
gradually flatten into grasslands through which the mighty Anduin 
makes its way, far to the east.

Outcroppings Among Rocky Foothills~
   Outcroppings of stone thrust through the thin soil of rugged 
hills, making passage difficult once away from the path but 
offering some protection from the elements - the thin road 
following the only passageway where the rocky hills are even 
decently even. In places there are pale evidence left of work 
done long ago, where a cliff have been broken to allow the road 
to be passable by wagons. Tenacious vegetation clings to the 
poor soil, only the hardier varieties surviving. To the west, 
the hills grow into mountains. Eastward, they subside, almost 
unwillingly it seems into grassy plains that stretch all the way 
to the River Anduin, far in the distance.

Crumbling Road Along a Ravine~
   The road here is barely wide enough for a wagon, with 
infrequent turnouts carved into the hill occasionally to allow 
two to pass. The eastern edge of the road lies along a sheer 
drop into a dark ravine, choked with twisted, entwined vines and 
stunted trees. In places, erosion has eaten into the road, the 
soil at the brink falling away, making passage hazardous for 
vehicles. Westward, the horizon is dominated by looming 
mountains, while the rugged hills continue to the east, gradually 
smoothing out into the grassy flatlands through which the mighty 
Anduin flows.

A Reinforced Road Along a Ravine~
   At some point long ago, heavy logs have been sunk into the 
soil of the crumbling hillside road in an effort to keep it 
passable. Now they are rotted and eaten away, treacherously 
fragile and slippery underfoot, and seem likely to break under 
the weight of a wagon. The eastern edge of the road runs along a 
sheer cliff over a ravine clotted with vegetation. Farther east, 
the rough hills flatten finally into grasslands, through which 
the Anduin runs. To the west loom towering mountains, clawing 
their way up the horizon.

Past A Ruined Shelter On A Mountain Path~
   Odd vertical outcrops of stone jut from the hillside. At some 
time, a roof of sorts had been fashioned over two of them that 
stand near to one another, but it has caved in. All that remain 
of it are shattered pine logs and rotted leather. A stone ring 
singed by fire lies nearby and seems to see frequent use, judging 
by the detritus of broken arrows, ashes and smaller bones 
scattered about. To the west rise massive mountains.

   The road turns north to west near the edge of a ravine in the 
south. A lone pine, twisted and gnarled, stands tall and proud 
on the very edge. It has been struck by lightning at some point. 
Scarred and burnt, it yet survives, clinging tenaciously to the 
thin soil of the rugged hillside. To the east, the rough hills 
continue until they subside slowly into an gloriously lush 
forest. Westwards, great mountains rise, looming overhead.

   Jagged outcrops of stone make traveling difficult as the 
hillside rises to meet a steep, rocky ridge line and the path 
ascends from the south to higher grounds in the north. A sparse 
copse of stunted trees clings stubbornly to the steep ground, 
their trunks bending and twisting to struggle toward the light. 
Mountains to the west scrape against the sky, while to the east, 
the rugged hills gradually meld into beautiful and vital forest 
whom is almost startling green and golden all through the year.

   The soil has warn away along the top of this ridge line, wind 
and rain taking it down the steep hillsides. Bare, grey stone is 
exposed all along the top, broken and scarred. Along with the 
shifted soil and bared stone are the remains of an ancient 
stone-laid road that travels north to south and dissapears in 
both directions into an overgrown path across the rocky hills. 
Not far to the north lies a river, flowing down eastwards from 
the mountains - and the remains of a broken bridge lies on 
northwards. To the west, craggy mountains stretch for the sky, 
and eastwards, the rugged hills flatten gradually to reach the 
edge of a beautiful and lush forest with healthy green and golden 
trees.

A Broken Stone Arch~
   A quick-moving river thin and yet powerful has bored a passage 
through solid stone, creating a deeply set riverbank. Across it 
was once set a stone bridge that have fallen either by hands of 
thinking creatures or the passage of time. Once wide enough for 
both carts and wagons its foundations on both sides of the river 
stand strong and well-made, seeming a lot more recent in its 
build then the vague trail that leads southwards through the 
rocky hills. The stones of the stream bed are coated with moss 
and the bank covered with ferns. To the east, rocky hills 
subside to into a beautiful forest that is teeming with fresh 
vitality. Westward loom high, craggy peaks of mountains.

rocky hills, and soil have gathered here during the decades to 
allow a thick vegetation. Steep walls lies to the west and the 
north, slippery rock and hard earth that seems like a very hard 
climb. The ravine continues on northwards - only to the east the 
ravine leads out to lower rocky hills where the ground descends 
to lower altitude towards an lush and healthy forest further 
away.

Deep In A Muddy Ravine~
   In a wedge at an age-old ravine that continues south and east, 
its steep and walls made of rock and hard-pressed soil do not 
invite a climber and as such the pathways from here are limited. 
Soil have been gathered here for a long time, and during wet 
season it becomes a yard deep of water soaked mud. Many trees 
and bushes grows here and one shrubbery almost hides a big crack 
in the side of the deep chasm - a cavity that is partially filled 
up with earth.

Amongst Trees And Bushes At Ravine's Eastern End~
   Much vegetation grows here, rooted in the deep, very wet and 
loose soil of the ravine - a chasm with steep sides that makes 
climbing nigh impossible. It opens up to the lower rocky hills 
in the east and a lush forest is visible further away. A row of 
sharp cliffs lies sprawled near the eastern exit, looking almost 
like fangs.

   Past the edge of the ravine - an enormous ditch in the 
landscape once shaped by running water - the ground lies quite a

and bushes. Steep walls into the narrow chasm leads downwards, 
slippery rock and hard-packed earth. To the west rises mountains 
in the distance, and eastwards lies a vital and beautiful forest.

A Rockbound Slope Near The Edge Of An Ravine~
   The hills slope downwards towards the ravine in the south, 
strewn with boulders and rocks in many sizes and shapes. Some of 
the stone have been dragged or rolled here from the higher ground 
in the west and it be fairly easy to start a rock slide that 
would plummet southwards into the ravine below. Some sparse 
plants and bushes struggle on the harsh slope, and a gnarly 
conifer stands out as it grows with its roots sturdily planted on 
the very edge of the chasm.

A Stark Mountainside Encroaching A River~
   Patches of grass, tough and sharp-bladed, find sporadic 
purchase on the mountainsides. Obdurate stone seems to encompass 
all. Slides of loose stone shift underfoot like rapidly running 
water. Higher mountains dominate the western sky. To the north 
flows a strong and fast river through a bank dug deep into the 
stone by the unrelenting water.

Steep Slopes Ending To The North In A River~
   Steep slopes are studded with jagged outcrops of stone 
interspersed with treacherous slopes of crumbled shale. Hulking 
rock to the west seems to overhang the smaller mountains here. 
Despite the bitterness of the landscape, life manages to find a 
way to exist. Sparse patches of unhealthy-looking vegetation 
ekes out an existence, clinging tenaciously to the rock. Even 
higher mountains loom to the west. Northwards the way is blocked 
by a deep and swift river.

At The Edge Of A Mountain River~
   The poor, thin soil that covers the rocky mountainside 
supports only the hardiest of plant life. Scraggly trees 
occasionally are found, clinging to the steep slopes, their roots 
creeping into cracks and crumbling the stone. A swift and cold 
river is spread out across stone ground to the north - the joyous 
and almost crystalline sounds of a waterfall can be heard from 
the northwest.

Among Bleak Mountains~
   The cruel, unrelenting stone, beneath, around, even looming to 
the west, wears at any trying to traverse these bleak mountains. 
Unalterable, inflexible, the harsh land waits like a coiled 
viper. Any loose stone, the tiniest misstep, any moment of 
distraction invites perilous consequences. Small patches of 
hardy vegetation clutches the rock, and pockets of twisted, 
stunted trees exist in areas offering the slightest protection. 
Dark, looming mountains rise to the west. A deep trench lined 
cuts across just to the south here, sharp palisade stakes 
pointing northward, dividing all that is north, west, and east 
from a cleared construction site that lies beyond the barrier.

A Spartan Stone Tower~
   Darkened beams of fire-hardened wood rise at regular intervals 
from the flagstone floor, butressing thick walls of mortared 
stone on all sides. The beams criss-cross overhead in a complex 
pattern of triangles, each lending strength to the next ensuring 
the structure is both sturdy and sound in the face of siege. 
Narrow slits high on the walls, just below the hardwood flooring 
above, allow in only light and air with their narrow width, 
effectively ventilate the smoke of the torches that burn in 
sconces on each wall. A ladder is bolted in place along the 
south wall, rising to a trapdoor above. A massive fireplace and 
chimney on the north wall provide warmth and light to the wide 
room. A sturdy door of banded hardwood leads to out to the east.

The Wasteland of a Dead Forest~
   The light dapples this wasteland that must have once been part 
of the surrounding, lightly forested land. Broken, charred husks 
of trees lie toppled and dead throughout the area - and the 
scorched earth shows signs that a great fire devoured this place. 
The wind comes down from the rocky hills nearby, sighing through 
the branches of the nearby evergreens. The bordering forest that 
survived the blaze still has the scars of licking flames and 
black smoke. The whole of the wasteland itself stinks like a 
campfire, though there is very little usable wood to be found 
here.

Wild Mountainside Near River Crossing~
   Hardy vegetation clings tenaciously to the steep rocky 
mountainside. In small gullies or other areas protected from the 
ravages of the wind, stunted trees and gnarled bushes huddle 
together. Higher mountains rise starkly to the west. Northwards 
the glittering and vibrant river flows across a wide area of rock 
and stone where it might be possible to cross, the sound of the 
waterfall nearby casting its clear and soothing voice across the 
landscape and it bounces back as mischievous echoes almost like a 
song sprung from many mouths.

River Crossing~
   Sparkling clear water flows across stones and rocks here, 
still in wild joy from having been thrown down the side of the 
mountain from the waterfall to the west. While passage across 
the river here is possible, it does not mean that its easy and 
not possible to perform without at some point getting wet from 
the swift water that runs free and ice-cold all through the year. 
Taking a horse or wagon across is near impossible. The sound of 
the waterfall is wondrous here, and the echoes almost sound like 
joyful voices and are joined up by a choir of echoes that bounce 
off the nearby mountains. Prominent in the middle of the 
crossing is a large cliff that rises above the water. 
Rising high to the north is a crudely constructed fortification,
which is nevertheless sturdy of make. A wooden gate bars the
entirety of the slender river crossing, stone walls rising high
above them.

   The jagged mountains rising even higher to the west of this

terrain. Little vegetation can find purchase here. The air is 
thin, and the weather given to sudden, pitiless changes.

west sends its mischievous and crystal clear voice far in all

   Only lichen clings to the stone of the desolate mountainside, 
no other plant life can muster the tenacity. Large boulders and

and rugged terrain makes each step an act of great exertion. 
Floating through the landscape in the south lies a river that

year - having cut a path for itself in the stone and the rocky 
earth. Powerful and majestic mountains loom even higher in the 
west.

Wide Ramp Sloping Gently Down Westwards~
   This broad tunnel has very old origins, with its walls in 
places having an ancient look where moss grown in countless 
generations and torches singed the bared flesh of the mountain. 
While several supporting pillars of both stone and yard-thick 
logs are of fairly recent make, some supports are as old as the 
ramp itself and carry carvings that time has worn down. It 
slopes gently downwards to the west for a long stretch, strewn 
with stone shards and with small plateaus that have ridges making 
it impossible for anything or anyone dropped or fallen to roll 
downwards for any considerable length.

Entrance To Upper Level Drifts~
   From a larger cave, a platform leads to several horizontal 
tunnels to allow miners to cut the dark stones. There is a shaft 
opening that leads below, to the lower levels, along with the 
remains of a large basket and a contraption once used to raise 
and lower it. The shaft has, however, been sealed off by with 
thick logs that have, in turn, been weighted down with several 
tons of stones and boulders. Miners move about here at all 
times, dirty and worn but doing their work with stubbornness and 
pride.

North Drift~
   The excavated sides of this passage remain rough, individual 
shovel and pick marks evident on the sides and roof. The floor 
is fairly level with gravel, sand and dirt providing a fairly 
stable footing. It is about six feet high at its tallest and 
about the same width. Variances in the dimensions are minimal, 
forcing one to duck or move only occasionally to avoid bumping 
one's head or brushing against the walls. The structure looks to 
have been deliberately reinforced with thick log and timber beams 
and stays every few feet.

   This section of tunnel looks heavily travelled. The floor is 
dirt and sand, with a few small rocks here and there, that has 
been tamped flat. The walls are rough hewn, about six or seven 
feet apart. The ceiling is low, causing the tall to hunch 
slightly to travel through. The walls and ceiling still bear the 
pick, shovel and hammer strikes that created them. At regular 
intervals heavy timber beams have been put into place along the 
walls and across the ceiling in an attempt to gird the stability 
of the tunnel.

allow for fairly easy travel and only require the tall to duck or 
otherwise adjust their movements. The evidence of the tools and 
muscle employed to shape them still evident on their face. The

Perilous Mountainside Near River~
   Overwhelmed by their greater kinsmen to the west, these wild 
mountains are yet severe. No step is secure, threatened by loose 
shale, teetering boulders, and sheer drops. Sparse patches of 
thin grass may be found occasionally, clinging to small, 
protected bowls in the stone. Sudden changes in the weather are 
quite common, and quite perilous. In the south a mountain river 
have cut a deep bed for itself through the rocks.

North Side Of A Fallen Bridge~
   Across this swift and powerful river have once stood a bridge 
that arced across the deep riverbed that the mountain water cut 
out of the cliffs and rocky hills. What remains of the stone arc 
is only the foundations that stand on both sides of the river, 
old and well made constructions that have however failed and the 
river is now quite impassable unless one would dare try its fast 
flowing and ice-cold waters which lies free from ice all year 
around. To the east, rocky hills subside to into a beautiful 
forest that is teeming with fresh vitality. Westward lies high 
and majestic mountains.

Rocky Path Rising Northwards~
   The land rises very steeply here and the path struggles to 
work itself along a decently even path. Small, twisted trees dot 
the landscape, buffeted by the wind and clearly struggling to 
survive. At the edge of the track, a large, square stone juts 
from the ground. Its top is cracked and pitted and its base is 
hidden by coarse grass. It appears that one surface once held 
script or runes of some kind but weather and lichen have rendered 
it impossible to read. The great mountain range to the north and 
west looms large and it is possible to discern three distinct 
peaks.

   As the broad, rocky path makes its way up through the 
foothills it moves between ever higher outcroppings of rock, 
their faces slick with moisture. To the east the land drops 
away, heather and thick brown grass cladding the wide slopes. 
Occasionally, the way is partially blocked by rocky debris, split 
from the western banks by the action of the frosts common to 
these higher lands.

stream flowing along the path from the north and here rushes 
across some ancient revealed stones from an much older road. Big 
stones that are now withered lays along an passage forgotten and 
unused since ages ago - the swift waters spraying over and around 
them to run away into the east never reaching more then a few 
inches in depth when it flows over the stones of the road.

Path Meeting A Mountain Stream~
   A great shoulder of rock pushes out from the western heights 
and forces the track to skirt around it. A torrent of water 
pouring down its face has carved a deep furrow in the earth, 
washing away the soil and revealing smooth stonework, huge slabs 
of whitish masonry laid full across the width of the track. As 
the water drops it is flicked out by gusts of wind, allowing 
clumps of fern to grow in the cracks in the face. The ground 
underfoot is strewn with stones and sharp flakes of rock.

Broken Stones West Of The Mountains~
   Many ages of rain and frost have left the landscape riven and 
strewn with slabs of reddish rock. Away to the east the lofty 
mountains loom up, haughty and proud and their cast off scree 
litters the land. An occasional scraggy tree can be seen, 
forcing a way up through the stones, stunted and lopsided by the 
wind. Amongst the rocks, small rivulets of water run down and 
away to the west, carving small furrows in the narrow path going 
north to south.

   The looming rock walls close in here and begin to lean in over 
the path. The constant drip of water echoes in the confined 
space and the walls shine with moisture, almost as if they were 
sweating under the massive weight of the mountain above. Green 
tendrils hang down in curtains, beaded with droplets, their roots 
clawing the slick rock far above. 
   To the east, wooden battlements can be seen surrounding an the

swathes of tough vegetation spreading out on either side. 
Massive boulders lay strewn about, the wind whipping amongst them 
and sending sighing echoes all around. The great mountains stand 
in plain view, dark and splintered, casting their shadows down 
about their feet. Away to the west, along the horizon, the Misty 
Mountains fade into the far distance like a dark arm cradling the 
lands. Eastwards far yonder rocky hills fade into plains and 
meets a river that flows southwards.

   Fingers of rock thrust up on either side of a broad, level 
stretch of ground, passing between banks of earth topped with a 
fringe of grass and gently rising from south to north. Mud from

the way was once carved through here by the work of many hands. 
Far to the northwest, the horizon is dominated by an imposing 
range of mountains, shadows cloaking their slopes.

thick turf and heather which carpets the ground. Here and there 
larger areas can be seen, their edges worn smooth by the passage 
of time and rain but still showing signs of great craftsmanship 
in the manner in which they interlock. To the west, the land 
becomes broken as it rises up towards the great mountains and far 
to the east can be seen a golden haze, misting the lower lands 
and a river floating from north to south.

   A few solitary pines dot the broken landscape here and the 
broad track continues to rise from south to north. Huge 
boulders, shrugged off from the great mountains to the north and 
west, litter the slopes. The air is thin and cold and the grass 
is short and lies to one side, pushed by the constant winds. The 
three peaks of majestic mountains can be clearly seen, thrusting 
towards the skies - prominent patriarchs on the mountain range. 
A sparkling stream runs alongside the trail here in a rocky 
channel, its waters icy cold.

   Beside the wide path is a deep well, its depths giving up the 
lifeblood of the mountains, cold as ice. Over a lip of stone the 
water falls down into a rocky channel which follows the track 
down to the east. Ferns and reeds fringe the well and rushes 
line the sides of the channel. In both the channel and the well 
itself there is evidence of the work of hands, the natural rock 
edged and lovingly worked. To the east the land drops off 
steeply and the west and north are dominated by the towering 
presence of the three main peaks that stands out as lords over 
commoners amongst the mountains.

On A Rough Road South Of The Vale~
   There can be no denying the conscious effort behind forming 
the detritus of rock and gravel into a rough road here. The 
north-west horizon here is dominated by three distinct spires 
reaching far into the sky. These mountains are at their tips 
covered in snow year round. To the north-east a mirror-like lake 
of indeterminate size spawns the river slowing on the east side, 
going southwards. Not far northwards lies the very mouth of the 
vale, the ground rising even further upwards.

Following Path On High-Rising Hills At The Southern Mouth Of A Vale ~
   Travel at this point is fairly easy. Small stones appear to 
have filled a depression in the ground. it forms a rough road 
stretching toward far away mountains southwards and a lower lands 
in the north. The high grounds which this path lies upon gives 
an excellent view northwards over the vale. The north end of the 
valley appears to be perpetually cast in shadow. The land is 
only slightly sloped giving scale to the vastness of this area in 
that it travels from the forested lowland valley to the snow 
covered heights of three massive mountains. Aside from the avian 
the land offers little cover for large stalking predators. 
Taking advantage, ground squirrels, field mice, and other various 
and sundry tiny animals evidence themselves at every turn.

   When in season tiny flowers cover these rolling hills in vast

scrub grass and lichen covered stones. Underfoot small broken 
pieces of stone are densely packed so as to deny growth. Winding 
like a stream these stones become a semi-formed path. Little

rocky and ruined path into and old ancient road with laid grey

straight line of well-laid cobbles of grey stone can be seen 
abandoned farmlands reclaimed by the wilds. Grass and small 
trees cover the old fields where still much wheat can be seen 
struggling for existence with their more powerful relatives 
during the warm seasons. An old and razed stone cottage lies 
nearby whose herbal garden is since many years invaded by wild 
weeds. Much work and many lives have surely been spent in these 
parts and the land still bears witness.

grey stone are laid out as a road here that goes north to south 
along the edge of the serene lake that stretches out in the 
eastand which appears to hold a copy of the sky on its pure 
surface. Lower in the valley this road seems to have been 
protected from the wear of ages. To the west past some stony 
plains in the distance is a valley floor filled with a deep and 
full forest close enough that distinct and individual trees can 
be discerned at its edge. Tall grass, some old dry and dead, 
some new with long tough leaves, lies on the west side of the 
decrepit road.

Following A Road On The Edge Of A Mirror-Like Lake~
   It would take several men, linked hand to hand, to encircle 
the base of the majority of the trees that dominate the lowlands 
in the west - they rises in the from beyond a stretch of younger 
and struggling forest. A rough hand, perhaps altitude, has 
defined a line between the forest and the plains approaching 
three vast mountains. Little intermediary growth exists to 
soften the transition from runty grass dotted with various wild 
shrubbery and an expanse of broad giant leafed trees. A 
remarkable lake of still waters serenely reflects the landscape 
back at itself on the east side of this cobbled road. The path 
here allows the luxury of taking in this unspoiled place.

a remarkable lake that perpetuates with equal measure a sense of 
time, cold and stillness. Near the lake eastwards a stone pillar

be heard the sound of birds and other animals. There are three 
large mountains rising up in the far north and west.

Road Curves West To South Nearby A Serene Lake~
   Not far from the stony beach of the serene mountain lake does 
the cobbled road turn in a lazy and perfectly gradiated curve 
westwards towards the body of the Vale. Laid with much skill and 
with big grey stone cobbles this road have survived the ages - 
yet marks of age lies on the stones and some are missing and 
vegetation have claimed parts of the edges. In the far west the 
three white-capped mountains spread out in absloute majesty their 
arms embracing and shielding the Vale.

At A Bend On A Stone-Laid Road Through Grassy Flatland~
   Set with lazy curves to navigate through the Vale in some 
design known only by the original builders this road has been set 
with a craftsmanship that borders on the mystical. While worn 
and noticing the long years past, it still stands strong against 
the wilds that tries to reclaim it from both sides where the 
grass and weeds grow tall and hardy in the rocky but fertile 
soil. A large stone marker has been set beside the road and 
later tipped over during the years by unknown hands - the writing 
on it cut and damaged. To the southwest a steep hill can be 
spotted rising ominously from the ground.

Road Curving Lazily South To West~
   Wild flatlands in all directions wearing hardy grass and bush 
on its fertile soil the road leads onwards through the terrain 
with its grey stones tireless withstanding the burden of feet, 
hoofs and wheels during the centuries. Hardy and vital 
vegetation native to the flatland makes token efforts on 
encroaching upon the road but through skill or some magic the 
builders possessed it remains quite clear of intruders aside from 
the occassional green leaf or finger of grass during the warmer 
seasons.

Cobbled Road Going East And West~
   Grass in this area on both sides of the road reaches near knee 
high on a horse. It bends instantly with any breeze cast through 
the air. While the grass serves to obscure the view of the 
traveler, footing is easy hear and travel swift. The western 
horizon is obscured by three mountain tops and further east lies 
a very still and pure lake that stretches far north to south.

Cobbled Road Past Abandoned Cottages~
   The perpetually frozen heights of the three western mountains 
hinder most clouds and much moisture comes down across these 
lands. Vegetaition and tillable soil are fed mostly from rain 
and meandering streams. An old and well-laid road from grey 
stone cobbles winds its way roughly north and east through the 
area. A few burned and long ago abandoned cottages lies near the 
road, and the ground shows sign of an attemt to farm the earth.

Cobbled Road Through Untamed Wilds~
   Following an ancient cobbled road going east to west through 
wild plains in this mountain-surrounded vale. Unaffected by the 
season the wind blows through this area cold and crisp, as if 
chilled by the ages. Rough and untamed this area has an ancient 
feel even the most obtuse could not deny. Far to the east can be 
scene a large lake that perfectly mirrors the sky above. Some 
structure stands on the lake shore in contrast to the untouched 
feel of this place. Nearby rough grasses spout up from between 
talus stone and quest for the sky above. Occasionally the sharp 
eyed can pick out the lazy wheeling arcs of birds circling 
overhead.

   Stone underfoot does are shaped as grey squares along the 
road. In the directions to the west the grade rises upwards. 
Down toward the dale in the east the road reaches onwards, 
surrounded by wild and rocky plains. Here they are approximately 
the size of a grown man's fist. Rough scrub sprouts from the 
otherwise featureless grassland. Clouds seem to race across the 
sky their velocity an illusion caused by the sheer size of the 
view.

Along The Grey-Cobbled Road Across Stony Lowlands~
   A vast expanse of sky can be seen from these flat fields 
nestled between the western mountains and the lake to the east. 
The bones of a large animal poke through the ground here, 
yellowed with age their origins are difficult to discern. 
Rolling stony lowlands stretch in all directions from this 
grey-cobbled road and that can be followed westwards to the 
abrupt upswing of mountainous altitudes or eastwards further into 
the vale.

Road Through Windswept Plains~
   Splayed out across a rolling windswept plain are areas of 
grassland pocked with upthrust sections of dark stone. Closer 
inspection of these stones reveals them as ancient remnants of 
walls. Three magnificent spires of mountain dominate the western 
edge of these lowlands. The cobbled road cuts through the 
landscape east to west in a straight line from the gate and 
points towards the lake eastwards, almost unerringly well-set in 
the otherwise wild lands.

Traversing A Cobbled Road~
   Fields of wild short growth carpet the lowlands to the east of 
a series of mountains. Sandwiched between the arms of three 
patriarchs among mountains these rolling fields stretch out until 
it meets a lake further eastwards. The road going east and west 
are set with square grey cobbles, old and worn but still 
displaying superb craftsmanship - clearly a labor of love where 
no effort was spared. While stones are occasionally missing or 
having been damaged during the years, there is not one sign of a 
single mislaid cobble.

Road Between Wild Plains And Majestic Mountains~
   A thin layer of soil covers the unforgiving stone that 
dominates this area allowing grasses and small brush to grow in 
places. Like an old blanket this grassy covering is worn through 
in places showing dark gray rock matching the hue of the three 
western mountains. As one walks along a strange resonance echos 
from the ground below with each impact. To the west the terrain 
turns into pure rock as the mountains rise sharply upwards - 
further on can be seen a large gate in the mountain with a stair 
leading up to it.

Near A Gate Into Moria~
   Hardy plants and low brambled brush have claimed this place 
for their own in this mountainous terrain on both sides of the 
road. The stand in mute contrast to the great spires of stone to 
the west and the lower laying dale of deciduous woods and wild 
plains to the east. This area appears to ring the valley below 
acting as a transitory section of land between the rough talus of 
the mountain and the lowlands near the forest that appear to be 
able to bear vegetation and more life then the unforgiving rocks. 
A road of ancient make runs from the great gate in the west to 
the eastern lowlands.

while its nearby banks been eroded by time and the elements - 
here the hard and rocky earth have created a gorge with a long

West Of A Dried Out Ravine~
   Bare stone and cliffs from the mountain gives way to some more 
mixed terrain as it slopes eastwards and far down into an ancient 
gasp that was dug by a river long ago. Most of the ravine have 
disappeared during the long years but here it is shielded by the 
hard bedrock and its positioned so near the pure rock westwards 
that smelting water during the spring brings little mud to fill 
it up. The slope here is uncomfortable and when the rock is 
slippery it might be precarious to travel across with risk to 
slip and slide straight down to the sheer drop towards the stones 
below.

lies the remains of an old and dried out ravine to the west where 
a sheer drop leads down to its belly that is filled with rocks. 
Scraggy stone ridges lead up to the edge where a few young trees 
have managed to get footage among the cracks. The sparse soil 
that managed to gather in these parts have been occupied by rough 
bushes and grass.
     To the south lies an abandoned palisade wall.

Across Bare Rock Near An Outpost~
   Here lies an lump on the terrain, a rise in the face of the 
mountain almost in the semblance of a closed fist of stone placed 
in the landscape and buried half-way. The stone is flat and 
bare, exposed mercilessly to the elements - any soil blown or 
washed away during the past years. In some cracks and dents of 
the fist, a few meager plants and trees have managed to thrive. 
In one particularly deep crevice that spans perhaps as wide as a 
mans arm there are some rotten lumber, which with various debris 
mixed with twigs and earth have provided a foothold for some 
thorny bushes. In the north-west lies a wooden palisade, and in 
all other directions stretches rocky untamed wilds. 
   Branching off the northern road is this worn trail heading 
south.

South Of Palisade~
   Northwards a high wooden palisade rises in as a barrier 
between the wilderness and a small outpost. The heavy logs are 
deeply planted in the rocky ground and mostly from cedar trees, 
it be hard for a man to touch his own fingers with arms 
encircling the wood. It is set against the wall of a steep rise, 
creating only a semi-circle against which an attacker may strike. 
Inside the barrier, only a guard tower and a majestic cedar tree 
rises visible above the edge. Southwards is a mountainous 
terrain, with sparse and struggling plants and trees that dots 
the beautiful and rugged landscape, boulders and cliffs shelter 
small patches of soil and plant life - all in the shadow of the 
majestic mountains that stretches out on the west side going 
north and south.

In A Strong Stream~
   Rocks begin to become more pronounced with the slope of the 
ground as it leads from the mountainside; here they rise as teeth 
from the icy waters, corroded by time and by liquid, still jagged 
and sharp. They are made more dangerous only by the fact that 
they are camouflaged in a deep mantle of mist that hangs over the 
steady rush of the river. Despite the rocks, the rivers flow is 
strong and swift. The water is cold, deadly so. Icy slush is 
piled against the side of the banks, though nature doesnt fall 
prey to its clutches as tiny plants grow amidst large rocks and 
bloom with delicate splendor during the spring and summer season.

Submerged In The Freezing River~
   Submerged underneath the surface of the bitter-cold water, 
various hazards welcome intruders. A gift of jagged rocks, a 
rope of thick-weeds from below constantly tangling in the feet or 
hands and the merciless beck of the current all strive to deliver 
a somewhat painful and potentially deadly experience. Surfacing 
is difficult with the very river itself working against any who 
have been pulled under.

Swimming Through The Waters Of A Mountain River~
   The River becomes more powerful through along this stretch, 
with less resistance and a deeper flow, the swifter and stronger 
the current becomes. Everything that nears it is eventually 
swept inside, twigs, leaves, debris and bit of ice fall prey 
almost instantly. The jut of rocks is less frequent than 
upriver, though still present a danger in some places in the 
waters.

The River West Of A Razed Bridge~
   The broken stone arc of a broken bridge looms up ahead 
eastwards, the rocky surface of it painted green in spring and 
summer by rampant strands of overgrown wild ivy. The low whistle 
of wind and the sound of crashing water emanates from within its 
bowls. Rocks emerge sporadically from the river, forming a 
chaotic assembly when viewed from the side. Splotches of 
wildlife show at the high bank, mushrooms growing against the 
boughs of sprarce old trees whom dot the rivers rocky banks. 
Often the trees rain their refuse down below; causing the water 
to be infested with leaves and twigs. There is a faint mist that 
hangs over the surroundings from the waterfall that can be heard 
far westwards.

The River Passing the Broken Remains of a Bridge~
   Once a sturdy bridge stood over this swift-flowing river,
but no longer is such the case. Even the remnant stones that
formed the bridge have been washed away and only the broken
arches upon either bank give evidence to its past existence.
The water of this river is crisp and cold, crossing it would be
a test against the constitution of any who tried to swim this 
in the waning days of the year.

streaming down to continue in a steady flow through the rise and 
set of the hilly land. Clusters of plant life huddle to the 
rocky shoreline, hugging tightly together as it eagerly drains 
the moisture from the soil, the majority of it consisting out of 
tall golden grasses and scraggly, long-thorn bushes. The waters 
are crisp and cold, with the wink of a fishes gleaming scales

occasion, one might even be able to catch a glimpse of fish that 
gleam with the refraction of light beneath the surface of the 
swift-flowing waterway.

west. They are more made out of stone and rock then earth they 
yet are plentiful with life, bushes and small trees provide cover 
for smaller animals. Many of the tall hills here are set with a 
raised mound or two, made from stone found among the hills there 
have once been someone that have stacked stones across the 
terrain at the highest points they could find. Some of the stone 
mounds have fallen apart or been razed, others retain their 
original shapes.

   The only dwellers under the river here is earth and water. A 
cloud of sand is layered thick nearby the ground, stinging 
against skin. Mud has shaped over the sides of rocks that litter 
the spaces of the riverbed, thick and slimy yet resilient enough 
to withstand the pressure of the rapids. In the deep waters lies 
the remains of a razed bridge, pieces having sunk to the bottom 
when the stone-arc sank. Quite a few metallic items glitter 
briefly in the thick mud, and some shapes must be old bones or 
whole corpses that years ago been stripped of their flesh.

various hazards welcome intruders. A gift of jagged rocks, a 
rope of thick-weeds from below constantly tangling in the feet or 
hands and the merciless beck of the current all strive to deliver 
a somewhat painful and potentially deadly experience. Surfacing 
is difficult with the very river itself working against any who 
have been pulled under.

have allowed a smaller forest to grow in the soil that been 
accumulated during countless seasons. Plants and seeds spread 
from the trees have tried to find footing even here among these 
rocky hills but have limited success in ground that is more stone 
then earth - yet the vegetation is more lush here near the forest 
then further away among the rocky hills that spreads out in all 
directions but north.

   These hills are sloping down from higher grounds in the west 
and reaches far in all directions except northwards where the 
uneven bones of the mountains have allowed for soil to gather and 
a forest to grow. Here the trees struggle to expand their grasp, 
but the stony ground meet them with much resistance and the 
vegetation grows sparse among the boulders and rocks that litter 
the surroundings. To the south lies an obscured stone circle 
that looms ominously in an perpetual veil of fog.

the trees where the fallen needles smother it out. Bushes and 
brambles flourish in the filtered light. An occasional rock 
pushes up from the floor of the forest, starkly gray.

A Thick Forest~
   The heart of the forest clustered at the base of rocky hills 
is very densely covered with the thick trunks of coniferous 
trees. Perpetually bathed in shadow from the growth above, the 
forest floor has minimal undergrowth, besides the most determined 
of woody brambles. The crunch of fallen needles creates a 
prickly carpet around an old stone well surrounded by a few 
twisted, knotty trees that threaten to overgrow the water source.

Among Healthy Tree Younglings~
   No line, nor artifice of man, mars the random design of nature 
here. Young trees, their limbs slender and yielding, grow from 
the ground spread out on a gently undulating plain. Game trails 
cut rudimentary paths through the underbrush. Stones and fallen 
branches dot the ground here and there. Though it appears 
relatively young, this area seems to be ideally suited to support 
wildlife and the subtle evidence at hand confirms this. Rocky 
hills meets the forest in the north.

Patch Of Woods Dominated By White-Barked Trees~
   Several trees cloaked in white flaky bark grow from the ground 
in long straight lines before blossoming into leaf baring 
branches. They are approximately the height of six men though 
their slender trunks are no more than a few hand spans wide. 
They grow near each other in clusters of five or six though there 
are many of such clusters. Several full grown trees have fallen 
over, and their rotting remains reveal a soft wood and parchment 
like bark that peels off in sheets. At the foot of the standing 
trees and up their trunks grow a dark green spear leaved ivy that 
carpets the ground here.

   A rough clearing is formed here in a rough circle a stone's 
throw across. It is ringed by new growth trees, which grow at 
various angles toward the sky. Meadow grass grows waist high 
here. Yellow and supporting fronds on slender stalks it rustles 
slightly with any breeze. Small birds dart along the top of the 
grasses, darting in and out, seeking out food. The trees at the 
clearing's edge support many nests, both new and old. There are 
no paths here and to traverse this area one must wade through the 
thick grasses.

Deep Forest~
   This rarely seen section of forest stretches from one wall of 
dense foliage to another regardless of where the traveller looks. 
The ground is covered with decomposing leaves and green matter. 
The sky heroically tries to pierce through the overhead canopy to 
little effect. The sound of fauna are faint but ever present. 
The calls and scurrying of birds, rodents and other less savory 
denizens frustrate casual attempts to identify their source. A 
sense of claustrophobia underscores the ease by which any but the 
most experienced traveller can become disoriented.

Far-Spread Trees On Stone-Littered Soil~
   The sound of branch clicking and rubbing against branch masks 
the majority of the other natural sounds of this stretch of wood. 
Smooth barked grey clad trees dominate the landscape. They are 
spaced far enough apart to allow relatively easy foot travel 
though brambly bushes grow up at their feet. Game trails cut 
rough paths through the brambles in several directions and by 
sticking to them foot traffic finds easier going. The trees are 
tall and do not seem to have weathered very many storms.

Cliffs Ascending Westwards~
   Dwarfed by the great mountains westwards, the terrain here 
becomes clearly hard to travel with cliffs that ascends in a 
fairly steep angle continuously westwards and offers few visible 
paths to keep westwards aside from being gifted with wings. 
Quite smooth and simple stone underfoot, yet hard and unyielding 
stone for the one that would stumble and fall down one of the 
nearby slopes. At one of the most protruding spots, steps have 
been cut in the stone long ago and allows easy access to the best 
place nearby to gaze out across the mountainous terrain

Mountainside~
   The mountains rise very steeply towards the west here, almost 
horizontal at times, and makes passage westward either a fool's 
or an eagle's errand. Stone and sharp rocks dominates the 
landscape. There is little plant life that grows here, though 
where it does its confided to small clusters, herded together in 
a struggle to survive the harsh conditions.

Beneath An Overhang~
   The cliff side is concave here, tons of grey stone looming 
over travelers who dare this perilous trail. To the west, the 
drop off is sheer and quite deadly, ending in a rubble off 
shattered rock far, far below. In places, the overhang is 
uncomfortably low for an average sized man. Signs of centuries 
of passage can be found, scratchings in the stone, broken 
crockery, burnt bones, rusty old weapons and other detritus that 
is no longer recognizable.

Barren Lands~
   Plain and desolate, this barren land is often cast into a 
dreary grey by the vast mountains that loom high above to the 
west. Silence generally reigns over the area, the odd squawk or 
distant howl occasionally breaking the still air. The ground is 
hard and unforgiving, rough patches of grass sporadically 
spurring out of the rocky terrain.

High In Steep Mountains~
   Mountains scratching up to the sky gather the clouds about 
themselves, spilling them down the sheer slopes to be trapped in 
the jagged gouges below. Loose slides of shale and unsteady 
stones make traveling difficult, ready to spill the unfortunate 
or unwary over precipitous cliffs. Large boulders stand barely 
balanced, poised to bound downwards, knocking loose others of its 
kind and smaller, a riotous, lethal ambush.

West of a Cobbled Road~
   Here the going is easier. With the road still close enough to 
be seen little more than grass grows here. Stunted and broad of 
leaf it seems to be well adapted to this austere environment. 
Rising not above the ankles obstacles are easily avoided and 
one's stride naturally lengthens. There is, however, little to 
protect the traveller from any wind or storm that makes its way 
down into the valley.

Aside The Road~
   Hardy grasses keep this area green for the most part of the 
year. Far to the west three mountain spires rise up to the 
heavens. Hidden by tall grass a small section of old farm wall 
can be found. Stones tilled from the fields were roughly piled 
to form very basic definition and defense, ancient reminders of 
the habitation of these plains.

Between The Road And A Light Forest~
   Clearly visible from here, beside the road, can be seen the 
natural demarcations of foliage in the north. Below the tree 
line a handsome dale of trees grows both in the north and the 
south - eastwards lies large serene body of water. Running from 
the forest and encompassing the road are low grasses and mosses 
which slowly reveal bare stone to the west where three 
mountainous peaks dominate the horizon.

Rough Fields West Of A Road~
   Rough wild grass grows up beside a well made but ancient road 
as it runs north and south beside a forested dale and eastern 
lake. The land is largely flat here though it is gently sloped 
between the arms of three mountains, a large exception to this 
the steep hill which juts up to the west. A river makes its way 
from the lake southwards. On the shore of the lake not far in 
the east can be seen a monolithic structure. In the west is a 
young and struggling forest, with a core of ancient trees that 
rises in the background.

Peaceful Shores Of A Serene Lake~
   An sense of pregnant stillness defines the eastern lake. Its 
shore and swiftly deepening bottom is mostly made out of stone, 
and the water is clear and cold all through the year. Some hardy 
plants have burrowed their roots into the gravel at the edge of 
the lake, but they are few and the area where the fields meet the 
water is very pure. The land here is mostly flat at the 
foothills of three massive spires of stone that rise up to the 
west. To the west on the other side of a cobbled road grows an 
expanse of forest.

Grassy Lands Between A Forest And A Road~
   Low to the ground, stunted and sun burnt, a line of shrubs and 
bushes grows here beside the road. Opportunistic small birds 
have made their nests inside the dense branches. A few stones 
are piled on top of each other, somewhat resembling a wall 
offering shelter to one side of the shrubs. Long ago this area 
might have been cultivated though the evidence is far from 
conclusive. In the east lies a cobbled road, and to the west a 
young and struggling forest. To the northwest a large hill with 
steep sides rises from the earth.

Through Flat Lands Near A Road~
   Thick, coarse leafed grass grows thickly here beside the road. 
The land is fairly flat and featureless, grassy with a few loose 
stones dotting it. There are few features offering shelter from 
the mountain winds or the occasional storm. In the sky high 
above dark bird shaped silhouettes wheel slowly on the natural 
thermals generated by these lands.

Close To A Road In The Mountains~
   Bare patches of ground dot this place. High altitude moss, 
though lush, appears unable to grow in the depressions. They 
remain barren and even snow seems to melt away leaving them 
staring forever up toward the sky. Close to the road, this place 
is otherwise well foliated. Mosses cover the ground and a few 
large rocks support multi-colored lichens on their sunward sides. 
The air here is thin and what in the lowlands is easy requires 
more effort here. Surrounding the Vale in are the arms of three 
mountains.

A Stone Post Near The Stone-Laid Road~
   The vegetation in this area appears to be slowly creeping 
toward the close by road. Several small stones form a rough box 
on the ground approximately four paces from where the concourse 
makes its way. Whether a sentry post or toll box or some other 
mode of structure the grasses have broken through the cracks 
between the stones and one bush in particular has broken their 
ring and pushed the bricks apart as it makes its way toward the 
sky above.

Unshielded Plains North Of A Road~
   Without the protection of the handsome trees to the east or 
the vast mountains to the west this area is windswept and austere 
even under the best of circumstances. If a attribute of the 
altitude or the legacy of agriculturists long since departed, the 
ground here is covered by low growing grasses that do little to 
protect anything taller than a grown man's hand. Relatively flat 
it might have made decent farmlands once upon a time. Now though 
the only real evidence close to hand that this place was once 
populated is the near by road of grey cobbles.

Travelling Windswept Fields~
   Without natural barriers the wind whips down from the west 
unhindered. The grasses covering the ground here beside the road 
rustles back and forth under its force. The traveler passing 
through here can detect evidence of camps, burt fire pits, horse 
shoes rendered down to nothing more than red flakes, that could 
be remnants of a few summers past or they could be as old as the 
mountains far to the west. A cobbled road runs through the 
landscape in the south.

Humble Grasslands~
   From a distance these plains appear monotone, a green 
grassland under a vast sky. Up close though, even here beside 
the road, the diversity of the flora reveals itself. Clover and 
other small flowers grow in blankets of white, purple and yellow 
the season permitting. The road is still visible as is the 
mountains, forest and lake that dominate the extremes of the 
area.

A Large Stone Near The Road ~
   Breaking through the grassy veil that dominates this area 
above the dale beside the road is a large area of exposed stone. 
Several paces across and half again as many long it collects the 
heat of the sun. Only the heaviest winter snows can cover it. 
Small patches of lichens hug the stone like paint. Far to the 
west snows still cover the heights of three mountain spires.

Through Rough Scrub Between A Road And Old Forest~
   Rough scrub, growing no more than a hand span from the ground 
strangles this area beside the road. Tiny arrowhead shaped 
leaves grow on thick unyielding branches that haphazardly branch 
off from several meaty trunks and spider their way for several 
yards in every direction, hugging the ground as they go. 
Season's of leaves litter the ground under the branches and 
several rodents appear to have made nests underneath, at least 
partially protected from avian predators. The road here is only 
a stone's throw away and the mountains appear distant. A sent of 
mint hangs in the air here during spring and summer. Whether 
blown in on the wind or a byproduct of the area's grasses and 
small bushes is difficult to discern.

   A few fire blackened stumps open up a small clearing by which 
the traveller can catch their bearings by sun or star. The 
irrepressible greenery from which these ancient flame blighted 
sentinels offer respite grow up their sides with creeping ivy. 
The new growth conceals any other evidence of what might have 
caused the blaze that laid them low. Lightning strike or 
careless traveler, whatever the author of this clearing be, the 
last laugh appears to be of the verdant vigor that will 
eventually consume this area, forgetting the fire of a few 
seasons past or the shallow tread of those who pass through it 
now.

Patch Of Small-Leaved Trees~
   The trees here are mostly of one species. Smooth grey bark 
protects them from the elements. Their leaves are small, barely 
the size of a man's hand, and thin. Five pointed, they are an 
emerald green on their topside and underneath almost silver with 
dark green veins on either side. They grow thick on the tree's 
thin reaching branches and in stormy weather invert to reveal 
their silver side to the heavens. During the winter they shed 
them, creating the cushion under foot, to grow them over again 
come the spring.

Through Remains Of An Old Forest~
   This area, dependant on the season, is little different to 
those who travel through it. Old trees, their canopies blocking 
out the sun when their foliage is in bloom have reduced the 
undergrowth so as to be almost nonexistent. Skipping over a few 
roots as they breech the ground, footing is easily found. Travel 
here is effortless and but for a few chitters and squawks of 
those who inhabit the far above branches the area appears 
abandoned. Wind rattles branches and catches up seasons past 
leaves on the forest floor. The dance and song of the timbers is 
a slow and ancient one here.

Ancient Forest~
   There can be little comfort found in the vivacious life that 
abounds around those who cast eyes upon this stretch of forest. 
Strong healthy trees, lichens, mosses, bushes and brambles vie 
for supremacy in obscuring the concentration of the intruding 
observer. This place is a riot of the wheel of life. Even the 
most obtuse cannot help but observe the power of the cycle as it 
plays out before them here. Inherent in that cornucopia of life 
and rebirth is the fact that there is a place for your corpse 
here. The uninitiated can easily find themselves feeding the 
very celebration that caught their eye. Gigant cornifers rise 
against the sky, not very far giving way to younger and more 
struggling forest.

A Dark Part Of The Forest~
   With the trees pressing close, blocking out the light on even 
the sunniest of days, this part of the forest feels crowded and 
slightly sinister. Pine and oak trees grow taller than one might 
think possible - with fallen logs, thick ferns, and various other 
shrubs growing thick in between. Only the smallest of paths run 
in random directions through this part of the forest, laid by 
some previously passing animal. A glade lies shaded by the 
ancient cornifers. To the northeast a steep hill might be 
spotted even through the thick foliage.

Young and Struggling Wild Woods~
   The sounds of civilization have rarely touched this place. 
The clink and clank of metal seem an anathema to the undertones 
of windswept branches as they rattle against each other. The 
sound of those creatures that call this place home can be heard 
faintly as stillness allows. As one concentrates further the 
smells of this area become evident. Rich soil, decomposing 
foliage, and the verdant promise of seasons to come clearly 
define this as a place not despoiled by the hand of man. While 
young and struggling, these thin trees will someday form a lush 
forest. To the north an earthen ramp climbs between two steep 
walls to the top of a hill.

Fledgling Forest~
   Arboreal rodents have made their nests in the branches of this 
fledgling area of forest. Leaves and light-robbing shrubs appear 
to have denuded the ground of grasses. It is instead carpeted 
with a mixture of leaves and needles ranging from yellow to 
brittle brown. The trees are young, their eventual heights only 
hinted at by their current growth and their seeming immaturity. 
The land is largely flat, with great exception to the steep hill 
which juts from the earth directly east.

A Small Shaded Glade~
   This small glade almost seems out of place hidden deep in the 
forest. Protected by enormous cornifers that might have stood 
here since the last age, this small spring-fed pool continuously 
spills over it's edge and trickles over the rocks and is soaked 
up by the forest. The trees separate a bit here, allowing the 
sun to warm the cool earth and chase away the damp chill of the 
rest of the forest. Soft moss and lush grass thickly cover any 
trace of dirt before disappearing into the thicket of shrubbery 
and underbrush that grows just around the area.

Bleak Windswept Hills~
   Grey stone is strewn along the windswept hills - in the west 
lies a stony path. Very little grows here other than grasses and 
shrubbery, struggling to survive in the rocky ground. The land 
rises and falls into hills and small valleys, outcroppings of old 
rock hanging off the side of hills and ancient, dried up streams 
snaking through the landscape. A withered hemlock tree spreads 
its gnarled branches to the sky here, alone in a small shadowed 
gully. 
   To the north, wooden battlements can be seen surrounding the 
ruins of a tower.

Ancient Ruins~
   Nestled at the base of some rolling hills are the remains of a 
small settlement, little more than traces of burnt timbres and 
tumbled stone that is spread in clusters on the ground. The 
terrain is rugged, the bases of old buildings made out amongst 
the ruins that nature seeks to claim back. Vines and plants 
creep over the grey stone of an old well that remains somewhat 
intact, long ago having dried up and gone into misuse. On 
occasion, small bits of yellowed bone can be seen amongst the 
rubble that litters the ground. 
   To the north, burnt remains of wooden battlements can be seen 
surrounding the ruins of an ancient tower. The gate that once 
led through the battlements is burnt and broken.

a large craggy outcropping of that juts from the side of a steep 
peak of earth. Boulders and large grey stone is spread along the 
uneven ground, hardy grasses and small bushes peaking through the 
stony crevices. Occasionally the sounds of birds and small 
wildlife can be heard above the din of blowing wind.

A Tall Hill~
   Climbing high above the surrounding landscape, small plants 
and trees dot the sides of this tall hill. Large rocks and 
boulders are strewn about, covered in moss and lichens. The 
rotted stump of an old tree pokes out from below a small 
outcropping of stone, its girth wider than the small and hardy 
plants that grow nearby. Upon the peak of the hill is a massive 
slab of granite that is scarred in many places, ruins of statues 
surrounding the stone though little remains of the silent 
figures. Wind sweeps by, and the view of the landscape beyond is 
clear and far.

Base Of A Hill~
   At the base of a small hill of rocky earth is a scant grove of 
trees, hardy limbs raised high to the sky. A little pool of 
water has formed in a small gulley of rocks, fed by a small 
stream trickling down the hill slowly and steadily - to continue 
eastwards. The remains of armour and weaponry can be made out in 
places along the ground, the iron rusted beyond use and the 
leather rotted and blackened, signs of an old battle taken place. 
The occasionally sounds of wildlife can be heard in the branches 
of the trees, wind whistling through their branches.

A Hill With A Small Statue~
   At the crown of this small barren hill is a headless stone 
statue of a robed figure. The grey stone has been pitted away 
from time and its head nowhere to be seen. The hill itself is 
surrounded by much larger rolling hills, some barren while others 
hosting large rocks and boulders or hardy plant life. The wind 
here is still and weak, the hilltop sheltered by the larger peaks 
about it. As one descends a side of the hill, a large rock is 
half buried into the ground and a body sized hole has been dug 
underneath it. 
   A well-built palisade towards the north seems to have been 
heavily damaged by fire, yet it still does a fair job at stopping 
anyone from heading that way.

An Animals Den Under The Boulder~
   Dug out under the boulder into the hill side, this seems to be 
an small animal den. The entry hole is small, but quickly the 
den widens and expands into a tiny cavern. Small bits of 
yellowed bone and tattered fur have been strewn everywhere on the 
ground, remnants of the previous occupants meals likely. Within 
the den, the air is stale but warm, the hill insulating the dug 
out cave from the weather beyond the entry.

A Towering Hill~
   The climb of this hill is steep on all sides, the distance 
uphill long and snaking through craggy rock and loose gritty 
earth. Small bushes cling into the hillside for life, most 
growing below a mans shin and bearing small hardy thorns. Upon 
reaching the peak of the tall hill, one can survey the 
surrounding landscape of hills and valleys easily from the high 
vantage point. The remains of a fire pit have been dug out on 
the hilltop, surrounded with small stone slabs as if chairs. 
Illegible symbols have once been drawn with charcoal on rocks 
about the place, having long ago faded with time and the weather. 
   Shards of broken glass lies scattered amongst burnt remains of 
humanoids. The ground has been licked and marred by fire and 
battle.

Desolate Stretch Of Bumpy Ground~
   Leading to hilly land, this stretch of ground is bumpy and 
cluttered with overturned rocks and stones of all sizes. High 
grasses grow, bushes and small trees struggling with the rocky 
ground to spread branches to the sky. The wind roams freely 
here, little shelter from it amongst the tiny hills and barren 
land. On occasion, small abandoned dwellings can be seen, their 
thatch roofing and stone walls usually caved - abandoned by the 
builders. There is little animal life here, but on times the 
sound of birds is carried by the wind. 
   To the north, wooden battlements can be seen surrounding the 
ruins of a tower.

Base Of Two Hills East Of Path~
   Nestled between two rolling hills, this valley is home to a 
small grove of trees and bushes, a tiny stream trickling its way 
through the stand and down the valley to feed into a small pond. 
Reeds and water plants grown around the slightly stagnant pond, 
old logs having once been set up on its banks as if to serve as 
benches. The remains of a small stone dwelling are nearby the 
pond and grove of trees, the tumbled grey stone having caved in 
upon itself at some point in the past. 
   The area has been heavily licked by fire, even though small 
bushes and trees can be seen still intact. Tiny pieces of 
shattered glass lie scattered about the area, mixed with burnt 
bones and destroyed armor.

A Thorn-Covered Hill~
   This rocky hill is swathed in thorns, briars and nettles, 
growing past the average persons shoulders in dense thickets. 
Thin snaking paths lead through the hill, thorns starting to 
become overgrown and nearly consuming the small trails that 
intertwine in place. On occasion, a large boulder sits directly 
on the path, causing travelers to attempt to scale it or cut 
through the thickets of thorns. In one bush of thorns, pieces of 
a small rabbit skeleton still hangs in the branches, far higher 
than it could have possibly jumped. 
   To the south, wooden battlements can be seen surrounding the 
ruins of a tower.

A Barren Hilltop~
   Stretching a wide distance, this hill top is barren save for 
mosses and lichens, the landscape surrounding clear and visible 
from the high location. Clusters of stone and rock are strewn 
about, weathered round from wind, rain and the effects of time. 
The wind howls as the peak of the hill is reached, buffeting 
against bulky forms as it pushes dust and grit about in swirls. 
One side of the hill is steep, gravel and sand crumbling away 
down the incline until hitting the far below ground. To the west 
lies a path, and not far eastwards a river floats from north to 
south.

South-East Edge Of A Forest~
   From the ground, young trees, three or four times the height 
of a man, reach toward the sky. Few exceptions reveal them to be 
much marred by the passing of the seasons. Shedding their leaves 
every come of the cold the ground here is thick with decaying 
leaves and small sticks. Soft underfoot the ground muffles more 
noise than it echoes and the entire area has a gentle hush to it.

Sparse Trees On Uneven And Rocky Ground~
   Uneven ground is made more difficult to traverse by the 
plethora of flora taking advantage of this sparsely treed area. 
Young trees, some with white, knobby, parchment-like bark, others 
grey and straight would allow an adult human to wrap their arms 
around them and touch hands on the other side. Their incomplete 
canopy allows sunlight to reach the ground below. Littered with 
tiny off shoots of the same trees, brush, and fallen decaying 
debris, this area is no easy walk.

Light Woods Among Large Boulders~
   The ground here is fairly varied in its layout. Large 
boulders half buried by dirt and roots mark several levels of 
elevation. Slender trees grow out from whatever soil is deep 
enough to support their mass. Other trees, outgrowing the loose 
soil, lay on their sides, the dirt clogged roots, rough circles 
aimed at the sky, are like tombstones for the tree's failed 
attempt at too lofty a height. The exposed soil and roots issues 
an earthy smell and they look to be the home of more than a few 
small animals.

Among Young Trees~
   Traffic is forced here to conform to a series of natural paths 
as very young trees, barely taller than a man dominate this area. 
Their limbs angle up from the ground in a series of shoots with 
bases the width of a hand span. Close enough that their limbs 
intertwine it becomes very difficult for anyone to walk between 
among them lest they traverse the game trails cutting their way 
through them. A tall thick tree lies on its side amongst the 
thickest of the growth and may have once protected this area from 
the brush that chokes it.

Struggling Forest ~
   A few white bones poke up through the ground, bleached by the 
elements, they give little clue as to what kind of animal they 
once belonged to. Small rolling mounds, easy enough to navigate, 
create an uneven and moss covered floor. Growing intermittently 
are a number of fairly young grey barked trees whose limbs reach 
well past the height of a three story building. Their canopies 
intermingle overhead and provide some protection from sunlight 
and rain during the spring and summer months. Denuded come 
winter they provide little more than high ways for squirrels.

Young Forest Giving Way To Bare Rocks In The West~
   Coniferous bushes try to dominate by numbers what they cannot 
do in stature here amongst several tall straight limbed trees. 
Even to the reckoning of men this section of forest is young. 
There is little evidence of the variety of life and death that 
older sections of deep forest have. Unscarred grey limbs thrust 
seasonal leaves to the sky. Trunks, supple and thin with youth, 
give way rather than endure in heavy winds. At their feet gather 
the evergreen needled bushes and leaves of seasons past.

Bush-Littered Forest~
   There are several bushes devoid of berries here. Their dark 
green leaves, almost thorned at their edges, withstand winter and 
summer. The bushes litter the forest floor. There is a smell to 
them different than the rest of the forest. High above in the 
trees are quite a few rather noisy small nests comprised of what 
looks to be the small branches and leaves of the same bushes. It 
appears that whatever birds dart in and out of the nests have 
adapted to take full advantage of the flora at their feet.

Woodsland Covered In Young Trees~
   Fairly even and uneventful, the ground here allows for fairly 
unencumbered foot traffic. Trees, no wider than the torso of a 
human are claiming the area for their own, replacing small 
evergreens that tenaciously cling to the last few portions of 
sunlight and soil allotted them. Underfoot the ground is 
littered with browned leaves and broken sticks. One tree bares a 
series of slashes high up on its trunk. Approximately the height 
of a man from the ground, they look like some thick four fingered 
claw dug deep into the bark and slashed some sort of marker.

At The Edge Of The Forest~
   Here the young and struggling forest meet rocky hills in the 
south and the more forgiving plains eastwards, bushes and plants 
seeking place in a rush to occupy the sunlit spots between the 
trees that holds a healthy variety of species. A few large rocks 
jets up from the dark soil to the south, revealing in a way the 
areas true nature and gives reminder to that the earth and trees 
are just a thin mask on the bones of the mountains.

Grassy Fields Holding Remnants of Agriculture~
   Between the young forest in the west and the road to the east 
lies grassy fields, where a few lines of old stone walls tell the 
tale of worked soil. A square of thinly growing weeds and odd 
plants might once have been a house and a herbal garden - and in 
places one can find the occasional broken shard of clay or rusted 
piece of metal. The place is wild and beautiful, yet abandoned 
like this it tells a sad tale without words. Where once there 
been sounds of voices and laughter of children, there is only the 
wind through grass and trees.

Once Inhabited Grasslands~
   Stones are lined up in a small pile for a few feet here in the 
grasses. The ground is relatively flat and stretches for some 
distance in each of the cardinal directions forming an easily 
traveled field. The pile of stones had to have been intentional 
as they form a low lying wall and form an almost perfect corner. 
This area might have been cultivated at some point. The soil 
could hold some light crops. Any farms or farmers have long 
since departed as have any evidence of the tools of the trade.

Flat Grasslands~
   The ground rises here in small swells no higher than half the 
height of a human. No large vegetation grows here, instead the 
ground is covered with wild grains and grasses that stretch away 
in all directions. Tiny birds have bent the grasses in on 
themselves weaving nests into the golden landscape. Only the 
depth of the winter months brings respite from the hoards of 
flying insects that these darting birds constantly feed on. 
Underfoot, hidden from view, buried in the long wild grains small 
rodents skitter back and forth eating roots and whatever might 
fall down to them from the avian lofting above. To the south a 
monolith of a hill sprouts from the earth, steep walls blocking 
the southern view.

Abandoned Fields~
   To the trained eye it appears that this area would not take 
too much effort to reclaim from the wilds. It appears that 
agriculture was once practiced here long ago. Long faded are the 
carefully tilled rows, the irrigation ditches, the boundary 
fences, the livestock and the farmers. Still and all, the ground 
is flat and the soil looks dark and fecund. There are no trees 
here to stop the sun from shining down and the run off from the 
mountains westward would seem to ensure a steady supply of water. 
Now however, instead of crops, stunted grasses grow underfoot and 
rocks and other impediments dot the land. South lies a young and 
struggling forest.

North Of Woods Through Hardy Fields Of Grass~
   These plains from rocky and still fertile soil, set with 
strong and vital vegetation of mostly grass and bushes stretches 
out far in the north and west. While sheltered by the arms of 
three great mountains, this valley is on a high altitude and 
weather can at times be rough - this is seen at the vegetation 
that is a hardy sort and provides shelter and food for smaller 
animals amongst the grassy fields. To the north-east lies burned 
cottages near a cobbled road and south one can see woodlands.

Fields Within the Wilderness~
   Only slightly changing in shape these areas are decently flat. 
The land carries deep and rich soil on which grass and plants 
grow strong and numerous. Little marks of men can be seen here 
aside from a cobbled road in the west, holes from small animals 
is set in the ground and an old dead tree nearby that bears many 
old bird nests are just a few signs of the life that populates 
these flatland. A few large boulders lies near each other in a 
random fashion most likely made by nature and these slumbering 
giants wears quite a few scratches and marks that been made by 
creatures skilled enough to use tools. The sound of falling 
water is heard from the east.

Nearby Stone-tongue Spurting Waters That Gives Birth To A Powerful River~
   The icy waters of the serene lake to the north flows here over 
a stone lip into a rocky channel that flows onwards to the south. 
While it might be possible to climb up onto the stone formation 
that shapes the flow of the water, walking across the stone 
tongue itself would be possible only for a living legend since 
the constantly bone-numbing cold water of the lake pushes past 
waist deep with an surprising strength and speed. The lands here 
are rocky and seems almost carved from a stone bluff, while 
fertile soil and grassy plains dominates to the west and south.

Fertile Plains Encroaching On A River~
   These grassy flatland extend in all directions except where 
they encounter the river who flows cold and clear through a bed 
of solid rock. The bank of the river is mostly consisting of 
stone and the water provides a proud and beautiful image as it 
moves southwards through the landscape. An old and yet slender 
tree with arrow-shaped leaves dips its branches in the river, 
leaning outwards into the water. Southwards the lands shows more 
signs of habitation both recent and old, sound of falling water 
is heard from the north-east.

Wild Grasslands~
   These fields of rich soil that been overgrown by wild grass 
and weeds carries a harsh and unyielding beauty - solemn in the 
autumn, clean and cold at winter and strewn by marvellous flowers 
in the warmer seasons. Southwards the mark of population becomes 
more visible with a few ancient stone walls that in past ages 
been stacked by farmers that picked the rocks from their lands as 
they worked behind the plow. The ones that worked the lands are 
gone now and so is all recent marks of their toil.

Recently Inhabited Fields Near A Cobbled Road~
   Among the vast flatland of the Vale and among a landscape that 
bears witness to habitation in ages past - here there are signs 
of more recent life. A few lonely cottages made from logs and 
mostly abandoned and scattered attempts at farming and a lonely 
herbal patch aside some large boulders that have been attended at 
least as recent as the past few years. Marks of camps and fires 
along with freshly cut trees gives clear signs of occassional 
habitation of these lands in the wild and beautiful grasslands.

Inhabited Lands Near The River~
   These plains of fertile soil near both the river and close to 
the southern mouth of the Vale show clear signs of habitation. 
Land have been plowed and some small tightly gathered cottages 
and tents have been raised behind meager fortifications - they 
still are only dots on the grassy plains that spreads out along 
the river. Homes made temporary by hopeful people on the 
frontier wilderness. There is a smell of snow in the wind when 
it comes from the west, even during the summer the eternally 
white capped mountains yields a reminder of whom are the true 
masters of these lands. The river bank is riddled with stones 
and there is little mud or dirt to challenge the icy water's 
purity.

journey from the north to south its rocky bottom a blurry image 
despite it being both deep and swift. A small arm of boulders 
reach out eastwards into the rivers waters and on it can be seen 
some abandoned remains of a fishermans tools. To the west and 
north the grassy flatland expands onwards while south-west the 
landscape rises into bluffs and hills in an uneven and rocky 
slope upwards to the mountains.

Rocky Hills Yielding To Grassy Fields~
   The rough and uneven terrain in the south and west slopes down 
towards the Vale in the north and the river in the east. While 
still strewn by rocks and stones these fields more and more shows 
real growth of plants and grass with patches of young trees that 
carries old birds nests. Life and the strokes of elements are 
milder here where the land is lower and the arms of the three 
great mountains offer some protection.

Descending Highlands~
   Boulders and rocks fill these lands and mark the endless 
numbers of slopes and rises through a terrain that could hide an 
army in its wrinkles on the skin of these highlands between the 
mountains and the flatland below. Rough plants and weeds survive 
in the soil that been gathered and the nearby area is far from 
devoid of animal life. These stone-filled heights slope down 
towards the east and north onto more flatter ground and fields of 
grass.

Flatlands Changing Into A Rocky Riverbank~
   Gaining a more mixed quality the river while still being clear 
and cold starts to loose some of its clandestine purity, quite a 
few small and young trees growing here at the water as its rocky 
riverbank shows compromise and yields with the soil from the 
flatlands. The grass and bushes grows high here aside from the 
few places along the river that seen recent habitation and the 
occassional patch of land been plowed or there can be seen an 
abandoned cottage or long ago burnt-down building.

A Brief Stretch Of Wetlands~
   Here the river have gathered in a rocky pocket close to its 
main flow and filled up with soil and several water sick trees 
which roots have spread widely across this swamp like stretch of 
land. Westwards the ground rises swiftly and leads up towards a 
fractured bluff. Footing is still fairly solid and while a human 
could get his feet wet here or get a boot stuck in some devious 
puddle of thick mud - this place is not an inbred swamp ripe with 
rot and stagnancy but rather is freshly supplied with new water 
on rocky base and home to many beautiful plants and insects 
during the right seasons.

Deeper Wetlands Leading Out Into A River~
   Past a barren hill in the west flows a stream into these 
wetlands falling some distance with a bubbling sound across the 
stones into this fairly fresh patch of water and thick vegetation 
that extends and grows shallower northwards. It is a stony 
pocket of waist-deep water that feeds its surplus into the 
mountain river eastwards and a repository for frogs, insects and 
plants that are found fairly seldom at these high altitudes.

Rise Ending Abruptly With A Mountain River~
   In this rise of soil and boulders it seems like the flowing 
river in the east simply cut through and leaving a very steep 
drop down into the cold water that moves past on its journey 
southwards. North lies a more gentle slope down into a small 
stretch of wetlands that is fed by fresh water and during the 
late summers many insects find their way up here along with the 
chirping of the frogs. A few bent trees with small narrow leaves 
where most likely are sibling seedlings once and have entwined 
their limbs like embracing lovers. 
   To the south, wooden battlements can be seen surrounding the 
ruins of a tower.

A Rune-Marked Cliff Near The River~
   This natural cliff rises just near the water of the river and 
carries runes on its surface. Here the ice-cold depths of the 
mountains life blood have been some mixed with the landscape it 
flows through and are no longer crystal clear, yet it seems fresh 
and healthy enough to drink. Little bank or mud can be found 
here and the rocks themselves disappears beneath the flow. The 
rocky hills extends into the north, west and south with the 
majestic mountains forever dominating the horizon. 
   To ground has been scorched by fire, little pieces of glass 
and burnt bones littering the area. Despite this there are still 
bushes and trees along the river bank that appear to be in fair 
health.

Cliffs Sloping Abruptly Into An River~
   When struck by sunlight in the right angle during the day - 
the eastern river glimmer like an line of silver stretching from 
north to south. The cliffs here break free from rocky hills that 
stretches out in all other directions and throws themselves into 
the clear and cold water. A few steps have been cut in the side 
of the cliffs long ago and the withered stairs allow precarious 
access to the surface. Little but moss and plants grow here 
aside from the rare seedling that managed to find a grasp at some 
crevice in the rock. 
   To the south, wooden battlements can be seen surrounding the 
ruins of a tower to the southwest.

Fractured Bluff~
   The hill here have broken apart in several pieces with deep 
fractures going through it causing it to start collapsing. 
Melted water from the mountains and the small stream flowing 
south downhill have flushed away the soil that holds the stone 
ridge together and left little more then a sagging heap of dirty 
stones that slowly falls in on itself coloring the mountain water 
brown when the dirt is not frozen.

Gentle Hills~
   Here the rocky hills subside gently into less uneven terrain 
where the variations of slopes and rises gradually decrease more 
and more to the east until it reaches more flat and grassy fields 
at the water. Nearby and in all directions can be seen signs of 
old constructions - a rise that is an ages past collapsed stone 
building and a patch of bushes that hides the only remaining part 
of a stonewall made by unknown hands hundreds of years ago. Life 
is plentiful here and the vegetation stands proudly covering what 
was once surely considered part of civilization. 
   An impressive mound of ancient ruins lay spread out to the 
west, the only reminder of what must have once been a looming 
tower atop the hill. To the east stretches a wall of wooden 
battlements. The ground here is stained by the scars of fire and 
battle.

Lively Fields At An Ancient Stone Pier~
   The surrounding lands here near the river is teeming with 
healty growth - young trees, bushes and thick grass that reaches 
a man to his knees. Rich soil allows for some plants that cannot 
be sustained higher in the mountains and some knobbly low-growing 
fruit trees dots the land near the water. Somewhat fallen into 
the rivers water by the hand of the one that defeats all things - 
time have eroded an ancient stone pier but it is still standing 
strong and can still serve its purpose. The stones are a 
testiment to the builders, having been able to stand the trials 
of the past age. The river passing by deep and strong flowing 
southwards, ripples and curves created as it circles the pier. 
   The ground bears the scars of battle, burnt and heavily marred 
by both fire, feet and falling bodies. Fire seems to have 
devoured fighters whole, their bones and equipment lying burnt on 
the ground.

base of a house or a building lies covered in bushes on the top

stone ruins is spread out and some pieces of walls and a few 
stone-laid foundations of buildings still remains yet mostly 
hidden in dirt and overgrown by the wild vegetation. A lonely 
and cracked stone fountain in the form of a cup on a short pillar 
stands missplaced on a bushy hill. 
   To the north, wooden battlements can be seen surrounding the

be unsecure and slippery from rain or snow. The rise extends

to leave behind only the thing that mostly make up this uneven 
terrain - rocks and stone. Some grass and a few weeds have 
grasped hold of the watery edge and some trees have found 
themselves a hold but while beautiful the area here holds no 
great allure for vegetation. Among the rocks here and there can 
be found a rusty arrows head or a shard from a sword broken in

merry woman and that it mostly consists of seems to be stone that 
gathered to it handfuls of dirt on which trees and plants of 
various sorts try to survive on. At a place near a large boulder 
there have been done some serious digging and the amounts of 
rocks laid in a heap reveals that not much would have to be added 
if one wanted to refill the deep hole with only the stones. 
There is a slight gradual slope downwards to the east.

around. They offer protection for other kind of plants but 
mostly to animals and many tracks can be seen here, quite visible 
to even the most inept outdoors man. Rocks and boulders are a 
common feature laying on top the ground or piercing the surface 
with most of their grey bodies buried. Westwards can be seen 
some sort of meager path through the mountains going north to 
south.

A Tiny Stream Flowing Westwards Between Two Hills~
   Ice-cold mountain water flows from higher ground in the west 
and although the land in general slopes more southwards against 
more flat and grassy terrain in the south the position of the two 
hills makes the stream run on eastwards. Having made some modest 
digging it have created a narrow canal between the two hills, 
deep enough for a man to stand in and it reaching his waist 
-absolutely lethal for someone crossing the landscape at high 
speed when the sight might be reduced.

Untouched Lands~
   These grassy stretches of lands seem wild and free, vital and 
full of life during the warm seasons and later possess a serene 
beauty as the snow covers the landscape. Just a few solitary 
trees grows, alone but strong and tall. No sign of habitation 
can be seen here. There lies wet heaths westwards and in the 
south. The grasslands reaches onwards in the east until they 
reach the beginnings of an forest whose depths are all seasons 
dressed in an eternal golden-green sheen.

Heath East Of Elongated Rise~
   With water gathering here on these low set feet of an 
elongated rise the grass and moss have converged and puddles of 
water accumulate between them during the spring. Bushes and 
plants thrive along with mushrooms and golden-yellow berries in 
the autumn - but the few trees here looks a little sick from a 
overdose of water. At the cold season the ground is hard and 
unyielding while after and before the frost the land is soft and 
spongy, a boot or a hoof sinking down a few inches and leaving a 
brief water-filled mark.

to be here to stay. Plant and animal life have adapted with moss 
and fern spreading out and the ground adapting a very soft 
quality when it is warm enough to vanquish the ice.

Stretch Of Heath Surrounded By Grassy Fields~
   A slim tongue of wet heath reaching out eastwards before 
surrendering to less soaked grassy fields on all sides. Further 
eastwards a clear day one can see a beautiful and vital forest. 
The ground underfeet is drenched with water and as much tight 
gatherings of grass and weeds as moss and mud.

Mud-Footed Hills Between A River And Wet Heaths~
   These rocky hills end abruptly in a stony bank of the deep and 
strong mountain stream that dug a channel through the landscape 
in the south. Water from the river and the heaths in the north 
are seeping around the base of these hills and creates mud filled 
ditches thatfreezes solid during the winter. Plants and weed 
grow aplenty among the rocks that slope into the river in the 
south and to the west lies stone mounds on the top of nearby 
hills.

On Grassy Fields Nearby A Deep River~
   The deep and powerful river from the north bends here 
graciously and carries cold and clear water along southwards, 
wide and majestic it frames these grasslands with all its bushes 
and animals. Old bird nests can be seen in the few trees and 
tall bush growth that dots the lands, the weather is mild here 
compared to many other areas westwards. Near the water can be 
seen the remains of some stonework among the high grass, most 
likely the stone base of a building that long ago was diminished 
into rubble by the hands of time.

At Powerful River Past An Abandoned Campsite~
   Set on the grassy fields near this great and powerful rivers 
are set an old and abandoned camp, many tents and a few temporary 
wooden structures huddle together behind some very meager 
fortifications in the shape of ditches and some sharpened poles. 
Most of it seems burnt or left to collapse. A trampled path is 
made to the stony riverbank from the abandoned campsite, shards 
of clay and some digging still to be seen among the plants and 
weeds that clings to the edge of the water in the east. Set on 
poles in a wide circle several hundred feet's from the campsite 
are broken and rusty swords, surely numbering near fifty total - 
left as a warning or a sign. 
   To the north, wooden battlements can be seen surrounding the 
ruins of a tower to the northwest.

Recently Deserted Pastures Close To A River~
   Not long ago farming was performed across a few large squares 
of land here, the ground broken up and sown with oats. Only a 
year or two have passed to allow for nature to reclaim the land 
and have already destroyed much of the hard work that is proven 
by the low walls of stacked stone that been picked up from the 
earth under much sweat and toil. Many things still grow wild 
here such as clover, wheat and barley. In the east a deep and 
cold river passes by on its way southwards.

A Tiny Stream Joining A Cold River~
   Flowing in a small ditch through the grass-grown fields a 
small stream from the west ends in the river eastwards and makes 
a very tiny contribution to the water that flows to the lands in 
the south - most likely joining up with the Great Anduin before 
finding its rest in the ocean. The riverbank is stony and still 
quite a lot of weeds and plants manage to find life alluring 
there, at summer small silvery fish can be seen in some 
still-water pools created by two prominent grey boulders.

Tall And Healthy Grass Near The Forests Edge~
   Struck with a flair for growth and beauty this stretch of land 
holds tall grass and bushes that leads up to the edge of the 
forest in the east, trees that as they grow closer together take 
on aspring tone on their leaves and no snow lies on the ground 
deeper inside the forest in any season. There is a feeling of 
tranquility here over these lands and a timeless beauty even as 
the years come and go and frost is replaced by the green buds of 
springtime.

A Stone Guardian At The Woods Edge~
   Among the tall grass and healthy bush growth are set a stone 
statue that faces the west and holds a hand out with an open palm 
in an unmistakable sign to wanderers - a warding or a command. 
'Do not proceed east' the slender grey stone statue speaks 
silently as the bushes grow up amongst its feet. The trees that 
lies beyond it in the east looks healthy and young, unmarred by 
time and hardship, even more so as the forest grows deeper.

weather rules the horizon in unchallenged majesty and beauty with 
their eternally white caps that holds through all seasons. In 
the south west can be seen a wide mountain stream and southwards 
lies a beach of sand, stone and soil. A feeling of life and 
tranquility lies across this area all year round.

A Rocky Riverbank Near Grasslands~
   Thick with grass and plants the vital flatland reach a 
riverbank in the south where a clear and fresh river passes on 
ice-cold mountain water from the west and it floats south-east 
into a beautiful forest. Plants and weeds grow aplenty near the 
water where the stones have been grasped by a multitude of roots 
and held in place, although one might think such concern is 
exaggerated due to the peaceful nature of the river-stream. It 
looks quite calm but it floats deep and its strength is 
undiminished as it traveled down from the mountains.

rock-filled beach in the south and the west and the forest 
approaching on the east it is quite shielded here and many more 
fragile plants grow in the meddle of sand, small stones and soil 
that makes up this stretch of middle-ground. The bank itself is 
shallow but the water is very cold - being fed down directly from 
the mountains - and the water grows very quickly deeper with 
strong currents.

an fair and eternal springtime. The trees are smaller here, if 
not younger. Slender limbed and more sparsely populated than 
deeper into the forest these trees allow gentle ferns and mosses 
to grow at their trunks. The colors are vibrant with deep dark 
mosses in contrast with emerald grasses underfoot. Filtering a 
gentle sky are golden green leaves held aloft by delicate 
branches.

eternal sentinel to the deeper denser forest, is an arcadian

Amongst The Elder Kindred In Lorien~
   Dwelling amongst the everlasting bloom and luster of Lorien 
dwells the elders, the first people to awaken. There are no 
death or evil here, and the air is filled by songs and laughter 
where Queen Galadriel rules with Lord Celeborn at her side and a 
year or a decade in the outside world can fleet past as a mere 
shadow of a memory. Guarded by song, magic and the true aim of 
elven arrows are this a little semblance or memory of the undying 
lands among the darkening shadows of middle-earth.

   Bathed in a softening glow from moon and sun this area 
nurtures a sense of gentle security. Slight, white limbed trees 
grow in groups of three and four amidst patches of mosses and 
light silvery grasses. Dark ivy winds through the trunks of some 
of them growing up the bases their trunks. There are several 
larger trees, their leaves radiating a golden sheen, in the area 
as well. Only the sounds of the wind in their limbs, the birds 
in their song, the soft trickle of an unseen stream, the voices 
of squirrels and such seem to hold court.

   The terrain here is very uneven, steep mountainsides sloping

to hide or get lost among the ridges and sharp rocks that creates 
somewhat of a stone labyrinth. Many holes and crevices are 
formed by the stone, creating shelter for both animals and 
struggling vegetation. Northwards flows water and one can hear 
crystal-clear sounds of an waterfall, while far in the east lies 
an lush and beautiful forest beyond an lower area of rocky hills.

shadows conforming to the craggy rocky landscape. Erosion has 
washed away the topsoil to the lower laying lands and only those 
things that can grow and survive on barren stone populate the 
area. Mountains rise in the west to bar passage.

   In a sheltered depression high on in the mountains, a small 
grove of tenacious, twisted pines has managed to cling to life. 
Their branches gnarled and sparsely needled, they yet provide 
some protection from the elements, and beneath their sheltering 
limbs can be heard the rustling of small animals. The constant 
mountain wind whispers through the contorted boughs, sometimes 
rising to a shout as it whips through the small grove. 
   An old trail curves north and east here past this grove.

excluding the occasional blackbird perched upon the wretched 
trees.

Small Pyramid At The Top Of A Hill~
   Fist-sized rocks have been piled atop this hill into a single 
rough pyramid, thigh-high on an averaged sized man. Grassy 
slopes fall away to either side, perforated by occasional 
outcrops of stone, layers of striated rock that have broken and 
eroded throughout the eons to resemble loose stacks of shattered 
stone. Some have fallen apart, leaving the hillside strewn with 
rocks and pebbles of differing shapes and sizes. 
   The trail continues east to west past the fenced farmland to 
the south. To the Northwest, the outpost can be seen close by.

A Barren Hillside~
   Wind and rain have scoured most of the soil from the barren 
hillside, exposing broken bones of grey stone. Broad spans of 
cracked rock are interspersed with stretches of loose, tracherous 
gravel. Here and there, intrepid, hardy grasses clump, the tough 
thick blades huddled together. A lone, determined, gnarled pine 
tree struggles from a crack in the stone, scratching its twisted 
way toward the sky. Around the tree is a small clearing of 
rotted pine branches and weeds. 
   Sometimes, a single northman wanderer passes through this area 
of the wilderness. Sometimes, it is a whole group of northfolk, 
making their way either to or away from the smoky signs of a 
village to the west.

On Barren Mountain Hills~
   A plethora of pebbles dapple the ground here though the crest 
of larger, more solid rocks is what governs truly the hills. 
Ragtag patches of moss growing upon the boulders show more life 
than the thin-spread grasses from which scruffy yellow flowers 
occasionally rise. A scraggly tree or two protrudes cautiously 
from the gaps in-between the stone behemoths, their roots 
struggling to find purchase in the arid soil.

On Broken Ground North Of Light Forest~
   Broken ground, slightly sloped is difficult to traverse here. 
Small water run-offs, dry and barren except during the rains, cut 
small grooves through an otherwise plain expanse of ground. The 
ground is hard and reverberates with heavy footfalls. Gravel and 
stones litter the unyielding land, making sturdy boots a most 
valuable item. Brown and dark grey lichen couple with deep green 
moss to make unremarkable vegetated patches. To the south a 
heavily reinforced fence guards an outcropping of farmland within 
the light forest. 
   The trail heads east and west here and is markedly more 
pronounced to the west as it approaches some fenced farmland to 
the south. If one continues upon the trail further northwest, it 
leads to the closeby Outpost, the palisade walls visible from 
this distance.

Ominous Hills~
   The footing here is treacherous, broken stone with sparse

Grayish black they are heaped in a fairly even veneer on whatever 
firmament lies beneath. Casual inspection shows rock on top of 
rock for at least a short ways down. There is a chill to the 
earth here and a wet even under the summer sun. Barely do 
lichens cling to the rocks as they remain mostly devoid of life 
aside from the occasional insects.

Rocky Slopes~
   Set in a landscape where dirt seems to have been crushed 
together in lumps to hold the stones from the mountains to escape 
to the lower plains eastwards are these slopes that leads from 
the higher ground in the west. Quite a lot of soil have survived 
here and given life to hardy vegetation and all the smaller 
animals that hide and breed within it - a few sturdy trees also 
stand here far apart and shaped crooked by the rocky earth on 
which they feed and the hard weather which occasionally hits this 
area of land. In the north can be seen some kind of stone 
fortification with a broken statue set on a rise.

At The Foot Of An Ancient Fortification~
   The natural rise of a hill have here been cut sharper by hands 
knowledgeable in the use of stone craft, and the remains of a low 
stonewall stands on the crest of the slope and all around the 
rise. Only a narrow path leads up to the higher position. 
Around the rise grows only plants and small bushes in the 
stone-riddled earth and there is little traces of animal life. 
Westwards lies an ancient circle of stone in a consistent embrace 
of a light mist or fog that surrounds the age-old stones.

Uneven Stone-Crested Terrain~
   The general slope of the landscape leads downwards from 
mountains in the west towards the lower fields and plains in the 
east - yet the land here is very uneven and many of the peaks in 
the rugged terrain is strewn with caps of stone in various sizes. 
While not originally the works of men, several mounds have been 
stacked on the higher ground by using the rock which been readily 
at hand. In the south-west lies an overgrown circle of stones 
swept in perpetual and ominous mist.

Up On Rise At An Ancient Fortification~
   The broken statue at its center speaks much of the age of this 
place, but signs of recent use are everywhere. The low western 
wall has been rebuilt and a trench dug alongside it. This trench 
has been tarped at one end, the burlap hemp greased and angled 
sharply downwards from the wall, across the top of the trench, 
where it has been staked to the ground at the other side, 
providing a serviceable if crude, roof. An old fireplace of 
sorts has been arranged and laid with stones with a piece of the 
encirclement, which still serves as some shelter from the 
elements. There is good sight from here, and it is an ideal 
place to defend given there is enough defenders. Shards of bone 
and rusty arrowheads, flushed into crevices by rain, reveal that 
this place has long served its purpose, and many times over - to 
the doom or succor of its builders in an age long gone.

An Ancient Ruin~
   The narrow mountain pass opens a bit here to a circular nook 
in the mountainside. The natural stone walls, rising on all 
sides save for the small passage, are smoothed by errosion and 
allow very few overhangs or footholes to climb. On the far 
western side of the area sits an ancient ruin of stone. Despite 
the evidence of eons past the stone foundation that remains 
reflects unstained and white in the light. This particular 
architecture appears to hewn by expert hands joining together 
seamlessly in remarkably large portions, intervening years have 
done little to diminish the expertise that carved them.

A Perilous Stair~
   Traversing the single long stair toward the echoing depths of 
this huge vault is disconcerting in the extreme. Far 
outstripping the reach of torchlight the depths are revealed only 
by the sounds of echoed footsteps and a distant dripping of 
water. No railing appears to have ever been a part of the 
stairs. They plumb the depths of the ruin for several stories no 
wider than the arm span of a grown man. While at one time most 
likely beautiful now it feels precarious. The small uniform 
stairs have retained their perfect angles.

A Massive Antechamber~
   With a single thin stairway leading several stories upward 
toward a south,ern exit and a high thin door on the ground to the 
south this massive chamber antechamber chamber is almost overwhelming in its 
scale. The walls are subtly carved and fitted white stone 
reaching toward a ceiling that stretches toward the extremes of 
torchlight. It is rectangular in shape, east and west walls 
closer than the walls offering entrance and egress. Ground shift 
appears to have compromised the complex at some point as the 
floor lies under a few inches of stagnant water.

A Grand Foyer~
   At each cardinal direction in this square are identical 
doorways. They stand approximately twice the height of a man 
though their width seems more standard. Subtle sculptures 
decorate the once white walls and seem to have at one time 
cunningly concealed narrow ventilation shafts every few feet. 
Water stains have obscured the base-relief wall sculptures and 
seem to have originated at the ventilation shafts. The water has 
pooled here reaching partially submerging a low stone chantry in 
the center of the room.

the ceiling of this room is of standard height. The 
craftsmanship that defines the other rooms, the straight lines, 
perfect angles, and seamless joints, are still evident. The 
walls, however, appear to have never held any artistic carving 
and the design does not have held the intent to impress. Green 
slime reaches approximately a foot out of a shallow pool of water 
that covers the floor. Moss and spores plaster the walls.

On A Mountain Rise Among Ancient Ruins~
   Here the cliffs extend into a steady rise that have in some 
past age been evened out so that even a horse drawn wagon could 
have passage with only some difficulty due to the incline. Once 
some round buildings or towers have stood on both sides of the 
ramp that yields to a plateau upwards and the main settlement 
village down below, now however only the foundations remain along 
with fractions of a broken wall that gives shelter to a gathering 
of low bushes. Some signs of habitation can be seen with a 
stretched leather hide to provide a small shelter and an 
abandoned patch where soil have been carried here to grow some 
herbs.
    A narrow alley winds its way to the south.

abundance amidst the ruins. Amongst the granite remains of old 
buildings lies long tendrils of ivy and other ground vines that 
wind their way across the ground and up broken walls and boulders 
as ferns and brush vie for purchase.

On A Mountain Slope~
   A large long house made of massive, rough hewn logs dominates 
the center of this area. Flat granite stones, ancient, their 
mortar and seams given over to tufts of grass, mark this area as 
having once been a center of far greater habitation. A small 
square foundation of a building lays almost completely ruined to 
the east. Strong ancient hardwood trees grow here on the 
flatland offering protection from the strong winds of the 
surrounding mountains. The long house is oriented roughly north 
south with its massive double doored entrance facing toward the 
south. A short series of stairs leads up to the doors, the steps 
decorated with simple geometric designs.

A Mountain Plateau~
   Signs of recent habitation are evident on what would appear to 
be an ancient city's foundations. Hard granite, worn with age 
and long ago use, identical in size, are expertly laid and form a 
level floor underfoot. Greenery has worked its way into the 
small spaces between the granite brick. Aside from the 
incongruity of the foundations found here and there, the 
surrounding wilderness is vast and vibrant. Through the trees a 
mountain range can be discerned from atop this plateau.

Among Ancient Ruins~
   Recent opportunistic settlement, comprised of semi-permanent 
tents, has taken advantage of an ancient cobblestone street. The 
street was wide enough for two carts to pass easily though some 
of the loose stones have been reclaimed to make low walls around 
the tents. Lean-tos have been erected to protect firewood and 
other sundries from the elements. An ancient round well sits 
nearby, its walls semi-collapsed. Mountain winds are almost 
constant here as they whip across the plateau. 

To the north, a worn path winds slowly up the mountain and a 
recently reclaimed #2longhouse#0 sits off the side of the path.

Rustic Kitchen Area Inside a Watchtower~
   Originally the base of a ruined building, this room has been 
turned into a kitchen. It carries ancient stone walls over a 
meter thick and a more recent stone pillar have been raised in 
the center of the room to ensure the stability of a stone ceiling 
that in parts came from the original building - but the old worn 
stones have been replaced in many places by freshly cut grey 
stone. The room is lined with shelves and crates, as well as a 
fireplace and stove for cooking. Eastwards is set a sturdy oak 
door and there are lamps bolted to the walls for constant light.

the sky. Like a chaotic staircase the hills build on each other 
without rhyme or reason in every direction. It is difficult to

Hills Reaching Flatter Lands Eastwards~
   A series of hills rise from the ground here, a collection of 
earthly waves frozen in time. Few trees dot their profiles and 
offer a darker green counterpoint to the wild grasses that 
populate them. One hill begets another, their height making a 
false horizon that defies attempts to gauge how far this 
landscape continues. Eastwards however the land slopes downwards 
and becomes flatter.

Uneven Ground~
   The ground is uneven, denying level travel for more than short

afterthought. It is difficult to judge how far these hillocks

Shadow-Cast Hills Near A Ravine~
   Defying season, daylight's gleam or moon cast shadow, the 
rocky depths of these hills are shielded from all but the 
fiercest elements. Primordial paths, naturally formed from 
valleys of the hills, wind in most directions if not directly. 
Sticking to the lowlands would make traversing the area more time 
consuming. The wide opening of a ravine lies westwards.

new growth and rich earth are carried on the wind. Travel here 
is easy, if one is not distracted by the effervescent beauty of 
the untamed land. To the north a river cuts a deep hole in the 
flat lands as it gently flows into the eastern forest.

Grassy Bowl~
   A low bowl, grass covered and dotted with occasional hardwood 
trees, traverses the area between a large grey mountain range in 
the west and an apparently limitless stretch of deep forest to 
the east. Though untended, wild grains and grasses grow in 
abundance here, this area appears to harbor wild life that hints 
at a sense of timelessness in its beauty. Small birds dart and 
cavort in the light of day while uncountable crickets blanket the 
night with their song.

Flat Land Nearing A Forest~
   Far to the west, obscured by the distance, a rocky expanse of 
hills build in altitude until they skirt the edge of a vast 
mountain range. A stretch of verdant plains, colors run riot in 
untended grasses and grains, blanket the area between the western 
mountains and an equidistant gold gilded deep green primeval 
forest. Aside from the occasional burr or pricker bush very 
little offers obvious threat to the traveller who's feet tread 
upon this land.

At A Stone Guardian~
   Sweet grass, its smell carried on the wind, grows naturally 
here to about the height of a man's knee to conceal the feet of 
a stone guardian facing westwards near the edge of the forest. 
The gently rolling prairie here are vast, stretching from a far 
western mountain range to the depths of an ancient forest in the 
east. A few trees, widely spaced, break up the continuity of the 
high grasses. Protected on either side this natural meadow land 
overflows with signs of life. Small birds dart along the tops of 
the thick grass, lizards and rodents scurry underfoot in all but 
the harshest of seasons, while crickets and bees flit about.

Brush-Grown Heath~
   Low evergreen shrubs with prickly edged thick waxy leaves grow 
over a sandy stretch of wild lands. Gnarled roots dig down into 
the sand aggressively as thick fingers to find purchase. It is 
difficult to make one's way here. The brush is thick and no game 
trails cut their way through them, what ever lives here is small 
enough to scurry under or fly over. It appears that the foliage 
remains year round though in the spring they do flower. To the 
east the heath ends in a vital and lush forest.

Heathlands At A Stillwater Pool~
   Breaking through the pathless swath of thick and unyielding 
short shrubs reveals a small bowl with a pool at its center. The 
pool's water is calm and still, clean despite having no obvious 
source, reflecting a picture of the sky above. The bowl in which 
the water rests is gentle sloping, ringed with dark green shrubs 
and sandy are its walls. The bowl, coupled with the vegetation, 
protects this area from the wind and there is a silence here that 
seems out of place.

Overgrown Heathlands~
   A stretch of uncultivated land overgrown with bushes and 
thickets confounds those trying to traverse this large area. 
Hardy in the extreme these plants rarely grow higher than a grown 
man's waist yet their branches are interwoven and difficult to 
part. The leaves on the branches are glossy,thick, and leathery. 
It is easy to see where one wants to go but the vegetation makes 
getting there an exercise.

Vital Heathlands~
   This open landscape is dominated by vigorous vegetation. It 
is bothersome to get through the hedge like maze of brambly 
bushes. The leaves of the shrubs are multi-pointed, dark green 
and hardy enough to winter all four seasons. Industrious rodents 
have cut paths under the wiry branches and between their trunks. 
Aside from the vegetation the area is mostly flat stretching in 
monotonous consistency for acres in every direction.

Hardy Shrubs Conquering A Stretch Of Heath~
   Dwarf shrubs with small and leathery leaves grow in abundance 
here, the heath is dense and appears to bear their shiny leathery 
leaves all year long. In the spring they flower with tiny bells. 
It appears that these hardy bushes have claimed vast stretches of 
uncultivated and uninhabited land. The bark that covers their 
trunks and exposed roots is a dark and thick craggy skin that 
could easily weather any storm.

Through Lush Heath~
   Dark green hardy leaves festoon the branches of the overgrowth 
of thick hardy low lying bushes that cover the landscape. Few 
are the stretches that these shrubs do not cover. Instead they 
densely occupy these quiescent acres. Growing up through the 
branches are long grasses which rustle constantly with even the 
slightest breeze.

Grassy Crags~
   Wild grasses cover level sections between an extended expanse 
of rocky crags. The hills here rise abruptly from the ground to 
block out the horizon. Traversing this area is tricky as the 
hills block the view of what might make for the easiest path. 
Multiple stretches of hills, various in their heights, surround 
the traveller here. Dawn comes late and dusk early here as the 
elevation creates false a horizon. Westwards lies a mountain 
path.

   Only the design of a divine hand could produce the sense of 
time suspended and death defied that pervades each leaf, bloom 
and bud here. A carpet of clover holds white flowers up toward 
lissome and willowy branches whose answer is a sunshade of spade

growing in clusters here and there amidst the small clutches of 
supple trees.

   No browned leaf underfoot nor wilted branch overhead evidence

trees look young, their skin bearing no blemish, they only 
lightly populate the area. In small clusters they grow on 
rolling hills covered in low growing greenery. A amber light 
seems to bathe the area even under the shadow of night suspending

   Subtle is the change that slowly comes across the land here as 
the light woods thickens into true forest. The dead leaves and 
dried grasses that seem to define the flooring of other forests 
is gone here, replaces by green low grasses. Further evidence of 
the passage of time or season is also wanting here. Grey and 
brown barked trees hold no scars, their limbs unbroken by harsh 
winds. This light land seems to harken back to prior ages where 
life knew nothing of death.

Near The End Of Amarathine Woods~
   Rolling hillocks hold young looking trees though their age is 
difficult to pinpoint. Their leaves are a full and golden green 
regardless of the time of year. Their limbs are slender and 
supple but seem rarely tested by harsh gale. The ground is 
covered with thick dark green moss which is uncluttered of sticks 
or old leaves. Several types of small birds lend their song to 
the perpetual springtime and flit through the tree limbs.

Entering A Realm of Unfading Leaves~
   Vibrant colors coalesce into an almost physical force in this 
light section of forest. Birches, straight trunked, slender of 
limb and branch, are an undiminished white. Rich brown bark 
coats more substantial trees as they reach up toward the heavens 
and blossom into verdant green gold glory. The ground is covered 
with short thick grass and dark soft moss. Even the stones here 
appear young and almost belong where they are. The land holds an 
almost conscious quality of perfection and design. This quality 
becomes more powerful the deeper into the dense woods.

Plains Reclaimed By The Wild~
   Occasionally disused sections of mortar-less stone walls rise 
up out of the grassland. They appear to be ancient property 
markers long since fallen into extreme disrepair. It would be 
almost impossible to guess how long ago this area might have been 
divided up into farms. No evidence is left of what kind of crops 
were grown or by whom. Instead mountain grass, mice and other 
scavengers have reclaimed what was likely theirs to begin with. 
For long stretches in any direction there is little to note that 
might be of interest.

Rough Fields Of Grass~
   Grasses grow predominantly here over the rolling landscape. 
In the summer they are burned yellow as little on these windswept 
plains can offer shelter from the sun's harsh glare. Winter's 
cold freezes the ground solid and coats with a patina of frost. 
These high altitude plains are a study in extremes and they are 
dominated in all directions by coarse tough mountain grass that 
holds what little soil covers the rocky terrain in place. 
Without the grass the spring run offs from the mountains would 
wash everything down into the valley below.

Uneven Lands Covered In Grass~
   The ground here is somewhat misleading to the eye. The dry 
grasses that sprout up from the ground are long enough that they 
would poke through any but the heaviest of snowfalls in the 
winter while in the summer they bake golden brown under the sun. 
They cover the ground completely rendering everything in sight a 
yellow-brown golden monotone that hides the fact that the ground 
here is uneven with rolling hillocks like waves on a immobile 
sea. The grass and the observational dead spots look to provide 
perfect cover for stalking predators.

on the source of illumination. Regardless of season there is a 
chill to the air and little life would choose to make this place

   Uncounted hills stretch as far as an eye can see. Naturally 
hewn paths, be it by wind or rain, descend from rolling 
elevations into shadowed saddles and valleys. Loose stones and 
rocks of various size dot the exposed ground making travel 
difficult. Very little growth or wildlife is in evidence from 
the trail. Though never steep enough to preclude travel in any 
direction there is definitely an easiest route that the 
unconscious foot naturally turns.

   A well made fence surrounds a large area of gently rolling

maintain the boundary between the obviously tended and cared for 
pastures within and the world outside. A consorted effort by any 
livestock housed within would be needed to affect it. The 
abundant grass within appears to be kept close cropped by 
consistent use. 
   To the east, a break in the fencing occurs, leading to another 
fenced in patch of farmland.

moon and sun make dials of every perpendicular plane. Rocky and 
stone festooned, the undulating landscape makes little concession 
to safe and easy travel. It is trying to attempt to get a sense 
of one's whereabouts here as the jagged horizon is obscured by 
nearby heights. Somehow through the challenging terrain a fence 
has been erected, stretching along the south area and obscuring a 
green pastured land behind. 
   A worn trail can barely be seen tracking through the uneven 
ground here, winding from east to west.

Hills East Of A Forest~
   The landscape here is dominated by a series of rolling hills. 
The slopes are gentle, however footing is made arduous by a loose 
covering of rock and stone. Very little foliage aside from 
occasional scrub brush breaks up the otherwise lifeless 
topography of the area. What little soil is here seems 
perpetually moist, the unyielding stony landscape allowing for 
only the slowest evaporation of rainfall. A worn, nearly gone 
trail winds out of the forest from the southwest to the northwest 
towards a distant Outpost. From here, one can begin to the long

   Blighted knolls defy attempts to be claimed by any plants shy 
of a few denuded scrub bushes that are able to extricate only a

anything other than the bare stone ground and the larger rocks 
that resist the caprices of weather and time.

An Ancient Basement~
   Stained stones, rough hewn, held together by crumbling mortar 
constitute three walls in this simple old basement. Obvious 
neglect and several years of wear are apparent in the debris 
littering the floor. The fourth wall seems incongruous to the 
rest. It is made up of three slabs of solid stone. Their seams 
run from the floor to the ceiling. Despite the years of water 
damage and corruption evident in the single square room there is 
hardly any gap between them.

A Small Storage Chamber~
   Hidden from view and time, this small storage room would have 
been ideal for hiding valuables. It is deep enough to 
accommodate a tall man laying down and, if crouching slightly, to 
stand. It seems to be carved singularly out of stone. Seamless 
corners are close to true and it appears impervious to water 
damage. To the west lies a door made from a well-balanced stone 
slab.

A Waterlogged Basement~
A stove, rusted beyond repair sits canted on broken legs in 
the corner of the north and west walls. A small hole can be seen 
near the ceiling, rimmed with a red stain, above the stone where 
a chimney might once have been. In the center of the room a 
basic knee high circular well sits, its edge broken, stones 
laying where they have fallen at its base. The evidence of 
wooden tables and benches is revealed by mushy pulp along the 
floor at the walls.

   Suffering from the weight supported by the roof beams and the 
passage of time, the ceiling of this rough rectangular room bows 
slightly toward the center. Square wooden columns rise from the 
floor to the cross beams above. At their base they appear to 
have rotted some and bow out. At the ceiling pig iron fittings 
are rusted red and shaggy with age. The floor is a haven for 
mold and small puddles of water.

Within A Wedge Of High Mountains~
   Nigh unto black in coloration three sheer stone cliff faces 
join here forming a gigantic ancient amphitheater within the 
surrounding mountain range. Dwarfed therein a small spruce 
forest grows up to the edge of the cliffs. Many trees look to 
have been roughly pushed over forming crude bone scattered 
clearings connected by similarly formed pathways. The 
encroaching mountains loom overhead wrapping the south facing cul 
de sac in an ever present hush. A wide crack rises up in the 
eastern wall revealing a thick darkness inside.

   Dripping water echos from somewhere within this cave. Natural 
columns stretch from the ground to the ceiling above. The stone 
appears to be of the constitution as the cracked cliff face

the course of ages. Slabs of stone have been piled upon each 
other in a haphazard manner at each side of the gate, fortifying 
it against any that would approach. Three horses could walk

recently cut into their hard surface. The air is chilly and 
numbing into the very bones and there is a smell of decay 
clasping the small space beneath the earth. A dull white-grey 
fog lies across the tomb, swirling unnaturally by wind that does 
not blow. There is a narrow stair leading upwards and an square 
hole in the wall to the east leading to an even smaller room. An 
vague and unnatural luminance is prescent.

Outside A Fire-Hardened Longhouse~
   Collected from the surrounding forest, this long house is 
constructed from fire hardened logs. The rounded walls of the 
steeply peaked roof is a bristly mass of weathered wooden 
shingles. Adorning the boarders of the exterior walls standing 
in contrast to the dull black walls are ropes woven into complex 
knot work designs. This artistry is repeated in the massive 
single slab, south facing, front door. Recessed into the large 
door, taking up less than half the expanse, is a smaller door 
large enough to admit a single human being. At either end of the 
peaked roof are wooden chimneys. A plaque above the entrance 
bears the symbol of two crossed mining picks.

surrounding a singularly large circular table. The smaller 
tables are surrounded up cured hides while the large table is

A Longhouse Interior~
   Built of a sturdy log frame, this longhouse is a single story 
built with high ceilings, made even more dramatic by the thick 
logs used as support. The floor, also of wood, has been worn in 
places by constant, dirty foot traffic. Windows on the western 
wall provide ample light during the day and a large candelabra 
hangs from the ceiling, able to be lowered and refreshed by a 
chain and pulley system. 
   Hides stretch across beams to block off the room to the north, 
while a doorway to the east stands wide open. A trapdoor in the

Outside A Grand Longhouse~
   Constructed of enormous logs and sitting on a raised earthen 
mound, a sturdy longhouse is provided a panoramic view of the 
surrounding land. A steeply angled thatch roof descends from its 
peak to overhanging eaves used to protect supplies from the 
elements. The long walls are made of enormous, untreated logs. 
Hay and mud fill in any gaps, providing protection to those 
within from the harsh winter wind. Along the peak of the roof 
are a series of wooden ornamentations curving like fangs toward 
the sky. 
   To the south, a small, terraced platform of even stones sits 
at the foot of a pair of large doors that have been overlaid with 
ancient hides. A path to the north leads back to the river and 
market.

Upon a Slowing River~
   Flowing at a quick pace, the speed of the cold water slowly 
begins to draw to a more even rate as it moves eastward from this 
area. Unembracing to any whom come to its water, the river does 
offer a plentiful number of fish in the right season.

In Slowing, Frigid Waters~
   Submerged here, the cold waters begin to draw to a slower pace 
as they no longer rush down from the hilly lands that lie to the 
west of here. About small fish can often be seen swimming about 
the cold waters of Nimrodel.

In a Noisy Kitchen Area~
   Filled with people at nearly every hour, this spacious room is 
crowded with the various necessities a kitchen might need. A 
thin haze of smoke fills the air during the busy times of the day 
and night, lessened slightly with the assistance of a window in 
the northern wall. Thick wooden beams support the ceiling and 
the same hue of wood lines the floors and walls. 
   A staircase set against the northern wall leads to a landing 
above, and a curtained doorway to the south heads back to the 
tavern proper. Heavy doors stand to the west and east and an 
open hole in the ground leads down into the basement, a 
collection of pulleys and ropes beside the opening.

worn smooth by constantly being tread upon and in between some of

A Cramped Sleeping Area~
   Confined in space, this room houses a couple of bunks and 
little more. The old floor of grey stone has been worn and 
abused over its years, yet it remains a sturdy foundation, ever 
constant and unshifting despite the cracks that have appeared 
between the stones to allow for small, dirt crannies. The walls 
of this old room are made of stout, aged timber, and the roof 
above is adequately thatched.

Atop a Steep Hill~
   Jutting up from the earth, this hill towers over the immediate 
area and offers an excellent vantage point. The sides rise up 
steeply on all sides, conceding only for the narrow stretch of 
earthen ramp to the south allowing the hill to be scaled. A ring 
of large stone blocks has been constructed around the perimeter, 
rising up about two feet, though their mass is clearly hidden 
just as much below the hard-packed soil. The center of the hill 
sinks in, which in concert with the stone perimeter provides 
cover from all around. A number of stumpy stones litter the 
surface, covered with various lichens and mosses. In the direct 
center lies a large scorched area with burnt wooden remains. To 
the east can be viewed a road travelling primarily north and 
south and beyond a great shimmering lake. Standing regally in 
front of the lake is a massive stone monolith. To the north a 
distance relatively flat terrain stretches on into fieldlands. 
To the west a thick and lush forest covers the earth, spreading 
south and meeting a much younger and more sparse wooded region.

Extremely Thick Forest~
   The forest grows almost impassible here, the trees growing 
close together and a myriad of thick bushes and various plants 
crowd the little space between them. Much of the brush is 
plagued with long, viciously sharp thorns and thick vines 
constricting passage. Several birds can be heard in the trees 
above and a number of critters scuttle about through the 
underbrush. Many berries of varying colors and sizes line the 
bushes and litter the forest floor.

Serene Glade Harbouring an Immense Oak~
   In stark contrast to the thick and unforgiving forest which 
surrounds it, this small glade is clear and peaceful. Glittering 
crystal clear water fills a circular pool at the center and many 
vividly-colored flowers speckle the tall and lush grass. On the 
western side of the pool a massive hill surges forth from the 
earth, littered with half-buried stones covered in lichen and 
moss. On the northern side of the pool stands a immense, stoic 
oak tree of countless age. It is clearly out of place in this 
area and towers imposingly above the serene glade and thick 
surrounding forest. To the west the great mountains loom, their 
foot reaching down to meet the hill.

Root-Filled Cave Beneath the Oak~
   Massive roots pierce this small cave from above and on all 
sides, an intricate network of thick snakelike wood. The soil on 
all sides is soft and quite moist, and pools of water have formed 
in depressions in the ancient roots. On the southern end of the 
floor lies a trapdoor, nestled in the muddy soil. Upwards a 
great hollow opens within the base of the tree, somewhere around 
five feet in width, scaleable via a tall wooden ladder fastened 
within the trunk.

   The dark earthen passage bends upwards here, closed off by a 
trapdoor in the ceiling. Along the floor the moist soil clears 
away, revealing the thick stone floor supporting the hill. To 
the far western end, a small trapdoor is visible in the stone 
floor. Torch sconces have been fixed to the walls, their 
flickering light providing dim vision within the tunnel.

   Hewn from dark grey stone, this subterranean tunnel is 
suprisingly spacious and well-lit. Torch sconces are set into 
the walls down its length, providing light enough to view the 
intricate pick marks left from its construction. It appears to 
have been recently carved into the earth and rather hastily. To

Roomy Cavern Paved with Stone~
   The ceiling of this spacious cavern is rough and uneven and 
appears completely natural, though the walls bear the obvious 
signs of expansion and are relatively smooth. At the center of 
the room, the ceiling sinks down to a point where crystal clear 
water trickles into a circular stone well rising from the flat 
stone slabs that cover the floor. Along the northern wall to its 
far left side sits a solid wooden door, and along the right side 
shelves have been cut directly into the rock wall. The east wall 
bears a doorway in its center closed off only by a heavy brown 
curtain. The southern side of the room opens into a small room 
via a wide arched doorway, and finally to the west is another 
solid wooden door, braced with steel.

Crudely-Hewn Circular Cave~
   About a third the size of the main room of the cavern, this 
area is less square and resembles a circle. The walls and roof 
were obviously cut from the stone in haste and bear crude pick 
marks - however, it appears to be kept immaculately clean. A 
number of various bunks and cots crowd the room, leaving space 
for little else besides a trunk at the foot of each. A firepit 
lies at the center of the room and casts a dim, flickering light 
against the dull stone. To the east a worn trapdoor is nestled 
in the stone floor.

Small Nook in the Cavern~
   A rather small room in the cavern, this nook is shaped much 
like a keyhole. The arched doorway which leads into the main 
area of the cave connects to a circular room with a domed roof. 
It is a bit cramped, only allowing room for about ten people to 
fit in at the same time. Unlike the rest of the cavern, this 
room is rather smooth from the floor and up to the ceiling, as if 
it was carved into the earth by water.

Shaft Within the Hill~
   Climbing up through the moist earth composing this hill, 
this shaft is braced with both natural stones lodged within 
and a dark wooden skeleton reaching to the shaft's top. A 
sturdy ladder is affixed to the wood, leading to the very top 
where another trapdoor encloses the vertical tunnel from the 
outside. The shaft is quite narrow and one of broad stature
would likely scrape against the wooden bracing as they ascend.

Within the Massive Oak Tree~
   The immense oak tree now opens up into a small room, with 
cover on all sides but the south where a small opening is 
situated, leading out to the branches. The hollowed out area is 
relatively spacious, with enough room for a handful of tall 
beings to stand within at a time. The floor is relatively flat, 
with exception to the outer edges which curve up sharply and the 
wide hole in the center that leads down the trunk. Several 
scripts and designs have been etched into the dark wooden walls 
and floor, which can be recognized as both Elven scripts and 
those of Man. An excellent view of the serene glade below is 
provided from this sheltered hollow.

Overlooking the Glade in the Oak's Branches~
   A natural bowl-like depression in this mighty oak rests just 
below the northern hollowed shelter, providing enough room for a 
couple people to stand safely. The largest of branches protrude 
from this point, and are large enough to be walked on, leading a 
distance from the tree's core. There are few leaves that grow 
naturally from the many small twigs and lesser branches sprouting 
from the large snake-like arms, as this tree is clearly ancient 
and close to death. However, many leather cords and a few nets 
are visible, anchoring a great deal of green and brown leaves to 
the branches and providing complete camoflage to those residing 
within the tree's bows. Surrounding the tree on three sides can 
be viewed a forest of unforgiving thickness that stretches on a 
distance, except to the west where the feet of vast grey 
mountains reach to the serene glade viewed far below. The pool 
glittering in sunlight and the top of the fortified hill can be 
viewed clearly.

The Top of a Lofty Stair~
   Here is the final stretch of the long Stair leading up the 
mountain, close to the zenith of a climb of the many hundreds of 
steps below. Just beyond is an expansive plateau. Though the 
path of ascent stands as a worn, but lasting testament to a 
peerless lordship over the realm of stone, it pales in comparison 
to the rugged landscape from which it borrows its own beauty. 
Several leagues west is a long arm of the mountains that reaches 
far south, towering above the Stair even at the ridge's 
lowest dips. To the east, not as tall, but a vision of equal 
splendor, is the chain of waterfalls comprising the Dimrill Stair 
that runs parallel to the stone one. Sinking away to the south 
is the majestic expanse of the Dimrill Dale.

Midway On a Grand Stair~
   The grand Stair comes to its midway point here, some hundreds 
of feet higher than the ground below with some hundreds more to 
go before coming at last to the mountainside. This path of 
ascent runs north to south in a line as straight as any mortal 
hands could ever produce. When looking ahead one is apt to 
notice its perfect alignment with the majestic gate that is cut 
into the mountain, crowning the Stair as a coronet crowns a noble 
brow. Even from here, with hundreds of steps yet to climb, one 
can make out the towering doorposts which the doors hang upon.

On the Lower Steps of a Grand, Stone Stair~
   These stairs are a lasting monument of an age long past. But 
the tale of their years is not fully told in their scars and 
disfigurements, which are all-too-few, a testament to the talent 
of their makers. The high-destined path is a work of precision 
and symmetry whose peers are few. Broad enough for ten to walk 
abreast with ease, it runs in a straight ascent to the high door 
into the mountain, some three hundred feet above. Two stone 
railings run on both sides, angular and robust-looking, that 
protect against falling over the edge, but are not so tall or 
wide that they prevent one from looking over to the ground below. 
Small beacons of an unusual shape sit atop these rails at 
periodic intervals.

beacons~
   Always directly across from each other on the stone rails, 
keeping the symmetry of the staircase intact, the beacons are 
erected every thirty feet from the base of the staircase up to 
its pinnacle. Each beacon is identical to the others and shaped 
thus: as tall as a grown man, it is a work of grey stone with a 
square, basin-like place where its fire would burn from which 
four stone posts protrude, supporting a shallow, peaked roof 
whose stone eaves offer protection from the elements. Each 
"basin" is large enough to house a sizable fire, meaning the 
entire staircase would have been well-lit, were they burning 
simultaneously--as they have likely not done for hundreds of 
years.

Ruined Road at the Foot of the High Stair~
   Running directly to the north, the cracked road meets the 
first step of a towering Stair--flanked by a pair of statues. 
However, the road also wraps around to the east and west of the 
Stair, suggesting something else tucked between it and the valley 
walls on each side. But it is this center road that climbs 
wholly out of the narrow glen, and up the side of the mountain. 
To crane back to look to the Stair's destination would likely 
draw one's gaze yet higher to the trio of oppressive peaks that 
rise far above, the true extent of their skyward reach revealed 
here at their feet.

approaching travelers. Now they have been defaced, literally, by 
the passage of time and recently by something more foul. Crimson 
marks of a crude, unintelligible sort appear on their bases, 
contributing to the decay of these once wondrous accomplishments.

Ruined Road at the Head of the Glen~
   The stone road continues here, leading west along the base of 
the stair, towards the steep face of the mountain that rises up. 
Here the path narrows and is a less embellished affair than that 
from which it branches out--the road to the south. Most hours of 
the day this spot sits in the shadow of the peaks that surround 
it, meaning it is often more chill than the road even a short way 
south.

A Perpendicular Meeting of Mountain and Stair~
   To the west is the rough surface of the steep mountain face, 
running north to south. So tall is its peak, that from here it 
is no longer visible, but lost somewhere above the lichen-layered 
base. It intersected by the smooth base of the west-running 
Stair, forming a perpendicular angle of the former and latter. 
Much like the road to the east, the ground is cracked and in 
disrepair, and the remnants of the road find their end right 
here, leading to a large stone building carved out of the stone 
of the Stair. Just off the road the ground becomes barren 
patches of grass, malnourished in the shadow of the mountain but 
struggling to survive no less, with the dream-like vision of the 
Dimrill Stair beyond.

Fortified Lookout Atop the Hill~
   This bowl-shaped depression atop the large hill offers cover 
from all directions save for above. Approximately seven feet 
deep at the center where a worn wooden trapdoor rests, a gentle 
slope climbs to meet the encircling stone walls on the outter 
edge. The stone wall is around four feet tall and notched at 
several increments to allow vision from all around, half of them 
large enough to be used as arrow slits. A ring of thick logs lie 
around the trapdoor, several notches and etchings carved into the 
barkless wood. To the east can be viewed the serene glade and a 
bit northeast the immense oak towering above the landscape. 
Surrounding the entire area from three sides is an extemely thick 
forest that rises above the hill's crest, except for the west 
where the foot of the mountain lowers to meet the hill's top.

Cramped Stone Tunnel~
   This tunnel is quite cramped, and someone of large size would 
find it very difficult to squeeze through the soft soil even on 
all fours. A scant frame of wood is all that braces the earth, 
which seems to offer little should the tunnel collapse. The far 
western end meets a rough stone wall, leading up to a worn 
trapdoor. East the darkness continues down the tunnel to meet 
another stone wall bearing a crude round door.

Jagged Mountain Wall North of a Stair~
   The walls of the mountain sit to the northwest, impeding 
movement in that direction. This area marks the point where they 
turn from shallow, soil-covered slopes to jagged rock cliffs that 
are apt to defy any attempt to climb them. Plant life is sparse 
and rugged when present, consisting of little more than weeds and 
the occasional stumpy shrub.

On the Steepening Slope of the Mountain~
   From the vantage of the high slopes here, it is easy to look 
back over the whole of the Dimrill Dale to the south. The plains 
and woods of the valley stretch away for miles, the landscape 
unchanged when it finally leaps over the far off horizon. 
Running more south than west, the snow-capped peaks of the Misty 
Mountains become larger and larger the closer they stand to this 
slope, the closest of which is hidden from sight by its own sheer 
cliffs that rise up just to the west. Further north is a narrow 
glen whose walls are formed by the mountain slopes and the chain 
of waterfalls that runs to the southeast.

Roots of the Towering Mountain~
   This is as far up the slopes of the mountain one is able to 
travel. Like a jagged stone tooth protruding from the earth, it 
towers into the heavens, offering no easy route of ascent. Apart 
from preventing further travel to the northwest, it also acts as 
a shield against sunlight, casting its tall shadow over this part 
of the Dimrill Dale at any hour past noon. The slopes of another 
mountain-peak perhaps a mile east can be seen from here, forming 
the beginning of the walls of a glen to the north, despite being 
higher than the rest of the valley to the south.

Mountain Slope Becoming a Glen Wall~
   Footing is perilous at times on the steep slope of the 
mountain, which levels off to the east, and becomes too steep to 
the west. Here is an interesting mixture of colors at most any 
time of the year. The mountain is a constant amalgam of various 
darker shades of grey, while the slopes hold the greenish yellow 
hue of sickly grass mingling with patches of bare soil. 
Northward the lower land to the east becomes a narrow glen walled 
in by this slope on one side and the Dimrill Stair to the other.

On a Mountain Slope Overlooking a Shadowed Glen~
   On the high slopes of the mountain to the west, an attentive 
viewer could make out veins of water trickling down the side, the 
thaw fleeing from the higher realms of the peak. They join 
together in one fast flowing stream that leaps down from the 
cliffs above into a small pool at the mountains base. From here, 
a small stream runs out into the glen and can be seen for many 
furlongs before it disappears beneath the light cover of birch 
and fir trees that dot the plains.

Mountain Slopes on the North Side of the Glen~
   The severe slope of the mountain pauses only briefly as it 
descends into the valley to the southeast. The pause forms a 
rough curving precarious path that adheres to the rolling slope. 
In evidence high above are a series of melt water runoffs which 
curl their way down from the snows carpeting the mountain peaks 
year round. To the south, further down the slope, can be seen a 
wooded glen.

Mountain Slope Cut Off by a High Waterfall to the North~
   A faint mist hangs in the air here, covering the already 
precarious pathway with moisture. The rocks underfoot grow slick 
as does the roar of falling water as one travels from south to 
east along the mountainous slopes. No vegetation marks the 
ground as broken rocks and sheer cliff faces pause briefly in to 
form of a path before plummeting down below.

A Precarious Path On A Sheer Cliff Face~
   A fine mist that further down the path might have gently 
coated the ground is now a constant stinging rain that only 
reinforces the thunderous cacophony of falling water emanating 
from further east. The sound is forceful enough to be physically 
felt as sound waves wash over the area. The path is relatively 
flat and remains wide enough for two people to traverse side by 
side easily however the cliff faces above and below become more 
sheer as they move from west to the source of the sound east.

A Small Grotto~
   This small grotto is formed by what looks like a natural seam 
in the cliff face. The deafening sound of the rushing water 
nearby is somewhat muted as is the near constant winds elsewhere 
along the mountain path. Moisture collects on these cave walls 
and pools briefly on the hard flat ground before trickling off to 
the south. This area though not dark is perpetually sheltered 
from the sun's rays and is markedly cooler than the surrounding 
area.

At The Waterfall's Edge~
   The cool chill wafting down from the peaks of these mountains 
is evident even in the summer months. During the cold season the 
ever present stinging mist of the roaring waterfall that ends the 
progression of this path freezes on the rocks making travel here 
dangerous when warm and almost impossible when cold. The sound 
of the white water as it crashes its way to the earth below is 
overwhelming here as is the sheer volume of water that cascades 
down the southern facing cliff.

A Fenced Area of Fields~
   Prepared to hold many fields, this area has been fenced off 
from the rest of the surroundings hills, an old iron gate 
blocking access of it from the north to all but the Guild. With 
rocky soil of questionable quality, the ground is hardly suitable 
for use in farming, yet many plots have been prepared and are 
scattered through stoic ruins of old that lie in their disused 
state scattered amidst the cropland. The sounds of animals are 
heard off towards the south, while towards the east lies the 
remains of an old orchard in progess of revivement.

Before a Well-Made Longhouse~
   Once a patch of the hilly terrain bearing old ruins, this 
place on the slope of a mountain now is home to the doorstep of a 
well-made longhouse. To the north of here, the longhouse has 
been constructed, almost always a flow of workers can be seen 
mulling around the doorway of the longhouse.

Within the Main Room of a Wide Longhouse~
   Built of sturdy wooden logs, this entryway of the longhouse 
serves as a throughway to the other areas more than a room of 
function itself. A large iron candelabra lights the room from 
floor to high, arching ceiling, able to be lowered and refreshed 
by use of a thick chain and pulley system. The wooden floor has 
been worn smooth in certain paths, dirt ground into the grains to 
cause them to stand out even further. 
   Tanned hides hang over the door frame to the north and an open 
doorway to the east heads into another section of the building. 
A trapdoor set into the ground provides access to a cellar and 
the main door of the building, leading outside, stands to the 
south.

Young Forest Entering a Valley~
The landscape here is made up of short rolling hills creating
an uneven, moss-covered floor. Tall grey-barked trees dot the
hills and dips, their bases surrounded in sparse bushes and
sprouting fungi. During spring and summer the area is shaded
by their enveloping canopy, though during the rest of the
year they stand only as barren skeletons atop the uneven land.
To the west, the forest funnels into a wide valley with high
sides to the north and south created by the outstretching
feet of the mountain.

Young Forest Within the Valley~
   Young grey-barked trees dot the uneven landscape within this 
wide valley. Shrubbery and fungi sprout from the subtle moss 
covered hills, though is somewhat sparse, allowing for relatively 
easy navigation. Rising to the north and south the feet of the 
mountains decline as they stretch east, their steep sides 
littered with nooks and overhangs and covered in various lichens. 
The forest stretches on to the west, where the valley merges with 
the mountain.

Forest Valley Meets the Mountain's Foot~
   The valley gradually ends to the west, where it rises to meet 
the mountains and levels off with the sides. Young shrubbery and 
tall grey-barked trees fill the valley, along with a small pond 
which catches the rain runoff from the mountain. The landscape 
within the valley is composed of short hills, rising and falling 
subtly under the great mass of youthful trees and covered in 
mosses and various fungi. Wildlife is prevalent, from small game 
to larger creatures and an abundance of noisy birds. To the 
north a narrow passage cuts into the valley's side near its 
merging with the mountain. The area around it is suprisingly 
sparse of any life, save for some lichens and moss along the 
floor.

At the Sloping Base of the Mountains~
   Here, the tall oak trees, ancient and looming, shade the area, 
while between them, even thicker brushes and plants grow to 
constrict travel. Most of the ground is covered in long grasses, 
obstacles hidden in their depths and the mossy undergrowth is 
soft when stepped upon, sinking easily under any traveller's 
weight. A few, massive stones litter the ground where the forest 
meets the base of the mountain, lodged deeply into the soft 
earth.

Narrow Winding Mountain Pass~
   Snaking through the smoothed stone of the mountainside, this 
narrow pass inclines a good distance to the north and then west. 
The winding is extreme, to the point where one cannot see further 
than ten feet before them at any point before the trail winds up 
and to another direction abruptly. At some points the footing is 
treacherous; due to steep inclines and loose rocks, along with a 
lack of outcroppings or holes in the smooth stone walls to brace 
oneself.

Amidst the Forest~
   Here the trees continue to grow, young with slender limbs 
sprouting here and there. The ground is still covered with 
thick, green grasses growing high to the average man's knee while 
the blades move with the slightest breeze, leaves rustling every 
now and then. Bushes and shrubs are heavy here, older despite 
the young age of the oaks and upon their branches sprout berries 
of all colors and variations, washing this part of the forest in 
a rainbow of color.

Youthful Woodlands~
   Dark, damp earth covers the ground of this area, scattered by 
various dead foliage in only a light layer. All the trees in 
this area are still young, struggling to make their way skyward. 
Evidence of the mighty trees prior, a few decaying evergreen 
trunks serve as fodder for new life, as delicate ferns and spongy 
mushrooms grow, nestled amongst their crumbling innards.

   Filled with a dense fog that is nigh to impenetrable by the 
sight of Man, this dark, underground cavern is a cool and eerie 
chamber with no signs of life or movement save that of the

size, no apparent exit or escape is visible from this place in 
the dense fog.

Within a Dense Mat of Fog Locked Underground~
   An endless swarm of fog sprawls out over the cold stone of the 
chamber's floor, moving onward in all directions with no sign of 
change. Cool and damp, the mists swirl about with no real sense 
of direction. The constant movement creates for an environment 
that is difficult to make direction in.

Within a Dense Mat of Fog Locked Underground~
   An inexplicable ladder of iron crawls up from the swirling 
mists and moves higher into a dense mat of fog that seemingly 
hangs from the roof itself. The fog here seems to be especially 
thick however, almost blotting out sight of the rusted, iron 
ladder that's bolted into the floor and perhaps the unseen 
ceiling above.

the fog creep over the flat of stone that serves as a floor to

along with the mists, moving in perfect harmony to the haphazard

Angost Pre-Game Starting Room~
   Welcome to Angost! If this is your first time playing a MUD, 
or Shadows of Isildur in general, type HELP NEWBIE for an 
overview of basic commands that will come in very handy during 
your time here. 
   
   We will shortly send you to a New Character complex, where you 
will have the opportunity to purchase discounted clothing, 
weapons and crafting tools that your character may have had 
before coming to Angost.

Wretched Guardians, or if you have very high intelligence or 
aura, you will go to a few rooms before then. If this is your 
first time in Shadows of Isildur though, we will move you 
directly to the New Character shopping complex.

easily cause any careless individual to topple over.

Abrupt Dropoff Within The Ravine~
   To the north of this area in the ravine, a sudden drop off 
falls into a ravine below. If one were skilled at climbing, they 
may be able to descend with care into the ravine, but such would 
require great effort as the jagged hills do not offer a secure 
descent.

Treacherous Path Along The Jagged Cliffs~
   Allowing for travel, this ravine is a haphazard course that 
snakes through the peaks of the high and jagged hills that have 
covered this splay of land. The air here is stagnant, and the 
sound of no animals come forth save the occasional, harsh echo 
from a bird's call.

Path Snaking Through Jagged Cliffs~
An narrow path cuts through the jagged cliffs which jut from
the rocky earth here, snaking its way ever downwards. Little
vegetation inhabits these desolate lands, save for the rare
sickly looking shrub. The path is riddled with loose gravel 
and sharp-edged stones, making passage rather difficult.

At the Foot of a Great Ascending Hill~
   Here, the path takes another abrupt twist to the north at the 
same moment as it takes one towards the sky. The path would 
clearly require climbing, and the sheer face of the hill could be 
difficult. However, handholds are plenty as the face of the hill 
is covered with jagged rocks.

Angost Pre-Game Room of Luck and Study~
   If your character is in this room, then their intelligence or 
aura is high enough to have warranted them extra study, 
knowledge, fate, or sheer blind luck, manifesting itself in the 
option to buy and select options and items not available to the 
average Angost player. Anything your character purchases here, 
they are assumed to have stumbled across it in their travels 
before arriving (you will need to make up a backstory behind 
whatever you find here). 
   
   IMPORTANT: Type "#6Scribe#0" to see a list of possible scripts 
in the game. Please carefully match these against the items in 
the shop. If you purchase a script, you #1-must-#0 first have 
the Literacy skill learned. If you did not choose the literacy 
skill in character generation, you must first purchase the 
literacy skill, then use the command to learn it, before you can 
correctly buy a script. 
   
   Type "#6Speak#0" to see a list of possible languages in the 
game. Not all languages are available for purchase, however 
typing #6list#0 will show you what phrasebooks are supported by 
this room. 
   
   Once you are done here please continue by typing "#6leave 
room#0". You will be sent to the New Character shopping complex 
to purchase clothing and other goods.

lumber, the domed covering fashioned of sewn burlap. The burlap 
ceiling is supported by a series of bent wooden rods that cross 
from one end of the cart to the other. The cart is uncovered at

recently littered with refuse and trampled by what appears to be 
a great number of travelers. Some small shrubs have survived the

   Bordering the snaking Anduin river, these lands appear to have 
been fertile and bustling with life. However, they have been 
recently littered with refuse and trampled by what appears to be 
a great number of travelers. Some small shrubs have survived the 
assault of boots, though most wildlife has vacated the area.

Fertile Lands Stretching Along the Anduin~
   Stretching on into the distance along the great Anduin River, 
these lands appear to have been fertile. Though they are no 
longer healthy, due to a recent horde that has trampled the 
plantlife and driven off the wildlife. Few shrubs and flowers 
litter the area and some birds still make their way through the 
lands and over the River, albeit warily.

Admist the Fields, Nigh to a Road~
   Here, the vast fields splay out as they journey as far to the 
east as one might see. Covering the fields is tall grass that 
reaches about the height of a man's hip. The yellowed grass 
would make for a sufficiently plains for wildlife to dwell, but 
no longer does it seem to have any presence of creature save for 
those dwelling in the camp off to the south and west.

A Worn Mountain Path~
   Cut into the mountain, this trail appears ancient, erosion 
erasing all traces of initial design.Wide enough for a sturdy 
wagon to pass through, wheel ruts lead in a slow, winding path 
along the face of the cliff. The lack of large vegetation on 
this slope of the mountain allows a glimpse of a large building 
to the north west, higher up. 
   From here the path continues on in a general northern 
direction, leading back to a collection of longhouses to the 
south.

Along the Mountain Path~
   Even with the assistance of the deeply cut wagon ruts, travel 
along this mountainous path is difficult in fair weather and 
nearly impossible in poor. The mountain rises straight up in 
parts, sheets of rock forming ledges that seem to have a 
precarious grip on the cliff face. Vegetation is sparse on this 
winding trail, occasionally allowing a large log building to come 
into view. 
   The trail curves generally east as it wraps along the 
mountain, also leading back down the slope to the south.

Before the Grain Mill~
   A large building made of whole logs stands to the north, a 
pair of double doors leading inside. The mountain rises 
dramatically behind it, so close that the building itself appears 
almost build into the face. The river drops from a waterfall 
fifty feet in the sky, crashing to the rocks below and rushing to 
the west of the building, bubbling along the bank. A wooden 
palisade is visible, down the mountain to the south east. 
   A treacherous path cut with a single pair of wagon tracks 
winds down the mountain to the east and a pair of double doors 
lead into the building to the north.

Inside the Grain Mill~
   The air of this wooden building is hazy with the dust of 
flour, coming most strongly from the open doorway to the west. 
Large logs of various shades make up this entry hall, thick 
wooden beams running across the ceiling to further add to the 
sturdy nature of the building. Torches flicker on open spots of 
wall, spluttering as dust particles mingle with the flame. 
   An open doorway to the west leads towards the sound of rushing 
water, and a heavy door to the north has been set further into 
the mountain's face.

Dark Storage Room~
   This large room has a natural chill to it, having been carved 
directly into the rock of the mountain. The dramatic sound of 
cascading water is audible even through the stone as it thunders 
on the rocks to the west. The entire room has been lined in a 
thick dusting of flour, heavier in the corners than in areas 
where foot traffic has left its marks. 
   A heavy door to the south leads into the main area of the 
mill.

Milling Room~
   The entire western wall of this room is dominated by a 
gigantic waterwheel, of which only the back half is visible. At 
every hour of the day and night rushing water spins the wheel and 
operates the attached cranks and pulleys. A round stone attached 
to this apparatus grinds grain into flour, and the entire floor 
of this wooden room has been covered with a dusty layer of the 
leavings from this work. 
   An open doorway to the east leads back into the mill.

Waters Rushing Past a Mill~
   The water current is strong here. The force from the massive 
waterfall to the north makes movement difficult. The waters are 
still foaming and bubbling from the long journey down the 
waterfall to the rocks below. To the east a closed iron grate 
near the mill is visible. The stream continues to the south as a 
small enbankment can be seen to the southeast.

Below a Dramatic Waterfall~
   The water falls from an unforeseen origin above, descending in 
a grand cascade over the edge of the cliff high above and 
smashing upon the rocks located here. The spray of the water 
inundates the area as moisture lies heavy and thick in the air. 
The force from the fall causes the stream to be completely foamy 
and opaque. The current here is unbearably strong, as the waters 
of this stream surge southward. No enbankment is available to 
the west or east as the many rocks surround this area, forcing 
the water back in upon itself. The only outlet is with the 
stream and its powerful current, southward.

Within the Rushing Waters~
   The rushing waters engulf this area as the waterfall gives

through a series of large rocks that stick up. To the east a 
cottage can be seen. To the north the raging rivers flow from 
their origin, as the river flows around and to the west.

A Bend in the Rapid Waters~

A slight decline causes a gradual increase in the speed and 
intesity of the water. To the east, in the distance the outline 
of a small cottage can be seen.

both are blocked by large stone slabs, causing this stream to 
close in upon itself, increasing its velocity.

   A wide strip of ground within the Outpost, this area has been 
dedicated for tents of various sorts, all openly displaying their 
goods for sale. Only a handful of merchants call this area home, 
and there is much room to walk between stalls. Wagons and larger 
caravans pass through on their way to or from the gate to the 
north east, and wagon ruts have been deeply carved into the wood 
and stone ground. To the east, a dirt yard can be seen with a 
gathering of trade caravans. 
   From here, the market continues to the north and moves further 
into the Outpost to the south.

Well Traveled Road~
   As the market tapers to an end, the wagon wheel tracks 
continue on in a straight line, carved deep into the ground by 
time and wear. A mixture of dirt, stone and old grass form the 
base of the large path that leads from the village proper to the 
north, towards the edge of the palisade. Beyond the edge of the 
fortifications the mountain rises high into the sky, clouds 
obscuring its top from view. 
   A small path snakes off to the west towards a clearing and 
wagon tracks run north to south from the village market to a 
large, elevated longhouse. A work area filled with a row of 
ovens and other communal equipment stands just to the east.

   A long wall of ancient stones runs north to south here, 
separating this area from the courtyard to the west. It has been 
built up further with a layer of newer stones, each carefully 
chipped and balanced without the use of mortar. Shade from the 
cedar tree to the north often covers this entire area, and grass 
and a cool breeze from the mountains make this a pleasant 
location no matter the hour. 
   A small, foot-worn path travels north to south here, leading 
towards the cottages at the bottom of the village and a smaller 
path wanders to the east, towards the market.

Large, Bunk-Filled Room~
   Dark wooden logs make up the structure of this open-aired, 
reasonably sized room. One small window has been built into the 
middle of the eastern wall, providing a some light during the 
day, whilst a few sparse wall sconces provide a dim light when 
they are lit during the darker hours. Apart from this there are 
no wall hangings or other forms of decoration and the floor is 
marked and scuffed from years of movement. Rows of bunk beds 
line the walls, the design purely for practicality and 
serviceability. 
   A large wooden door is set in the western wall, leading back

Large Bedroom~
   Cramped and confined, this small room is barely big enough to 
walk around. Built into the western wall there is a small 
window, which allows for ample natural light during the day, 
while a single lamp mounted on the southern wall gives out some 
light in the evening. The floor is predominantly timber floor 
boards, covered in one area of the room by an ancient, tattered 
rug. Simple furnishings take up the majority of space in this 
area, leaving only a small amount of room near a little doorway. 
   The only exit from this room is the doorway to the east, which 
leads into the hall beyond.

Courtyard~
   Open and spacious, this courtyard stands before the great 
watchtower. The ground of this open courtyard is comprised of 
hard packed dirt atop a layer of stones, freckled with the 
occasional errant, sharp pebble. To the south, the tower rises 
high into the air, the base made of ancient stone, as if built 
within a ruin and then reinforced. Further levels are made of 
logs, touching the palisade that wraps around the outpost. 
   A shield bearing a white tree is set over the southern doorway 
and a path directs the flow of traffic back to the street to the 
north.

Path to the Mountain Stream~
   This busy path seems filled with travelers day and night, as 
people wander south to the stream and trading post or north 
towards the village proper. Wagon wheels have cut their way 
through the ancient stone, though often a stray rock gets in the 
ruts to cause trouble to passing traffic. The faint flicker of 
torchlight or the sun overhead ensure that this area is always 
lit. 
   A small path to the west leads towards cottages and a larger 
longhouse, the main road traveling north to south.

Before a Large Longhouse~
   Standing at the base of the tower, this area has been left 
primarily open, though is dotted with a house or two as it 
wanders south. The most notable structure is a large longhouse, 
built sturdily of whole logs and bearing a dramatic, sloping 
roof. A set of double doors lead inside, as it wraps around the 
tower's southern stone foundation. A few feet of ancient stone 
wall jut from the ground in places, suggesting the remains of a 
fortification long since lost. 
   A small path leads to the road to the east, another worn with 
foot traffic moving north to south from the clearing towards the 
mountain stream.

A Collection of Cottages~
   This #2collection of cottages#0 presses directly up against 
the southern corner of the palisade. A hole in the palisade 
allows a brook to wander through, splitting the area in two as it 
moves further into the outpost. A small wooden bridge crosses 
the water, and grass and small plants surround the rocky 
riverbed. The log-formed cottages are all relatively small, 
their blocky designs functional to withstand the harsh local 
weather while the different painted #2colors#0 provide some 
aesthetic appeal and invidiualism for the residents living here. 

A path winds back to the east, following the brook towards more 
cottages and a small, crystal clear pool.

At the Top of a Jagged Plateau~
   Here, the hill abruptly levels off to allow for a more gentle 
sloping to the north. Although jagged, the path is less 
difficult than the course that leads down the side of the hill. 
To the east and west, taller hills rise up, but to the north, the 
path is unimpeded.

A Cluttered Flat Atop the Windswept Mountain~
   A multitude of sizes of rock litter this area, mingling with 
the pieces of metal, linen, bone and wood that have been trapped 
beneath them. Boulders, pebbles and odd sized stones all carry 
scorch marks and chips from unnatural means, taking a further 
battering from the unrelenting wind that sweeps through the area. 
   Wind tears ashes across the plateau, which stretches to the 
southwest from here.

An Outcropping of Jagged Rocks Upon the Plateau~
   The wind is blocked somewhat by an outcropping of jagged rocks 
that serve as a barrier before the ground drops off the massive 
cliff below. The trash and clutter of this area makes the ground 
barely visible, heavier here than anywhere else on the plateau. 
Holes seem bashed into the raised rocks, some unnatural beating 
having made their form unstable and causing the wind to create a 
haunting sound as it howls through them. 
   The plateau opens further to the northeast.

A Rocky, Windswept Plateau~
   The collection of rocks upon the ground tapers off slightly in 
this area, giving way to a few harsh, sharp bushes that have 
managed to grow through the blackened rock face. Wind blows 
trash and clutter around in an endless dance, ash often sweeping 
up to momentarily obscure one's vision. Over the nearby cliff, 
the mountain drops off into eternity, fog causing the view to be 
quickly obscured. 
   The trash and clutter spreads heavily about the plateau, which 
stretches to the southeast.

A Communal Work Area~
   Set slightly away from the bustle of the town, this area near 
the eastern wall of the palisade has been filled with a 
collection of ovens and other structures. Smoke and the heat of 
fires causes this area to be warm and stuffy no matter the 
season. The tower rises up to the east, casting shadow on the 
entire area in the morning hours. 
   A path leads west back to the rest of the town and a door 
north barely muffles the sounds coming from the blacksmith's

wall, a small wood-framed window on either side of them. A 
basic, worn rug with a simple woven pattern lines the floor of 
the center of the room, masking the dark wooden floor boards. 
The walls, like the flooring is made from dark wooden logs and 
has a few patterned carvings leading to the western hallway, 
providing some decoration in this otherwise sparse area. 
Wall-mounted lamps provide enough light to move through the area 
during the darker hours of the day.

mounted on the eastern and western wall provide light during the 
evening. A basic picture of a horse head has been carved into 
the eastern wall, giving the room some character and decoration.

constant trickle of water that run down the sides of the room 
give off the appearance that this room was built within the 
foundations of an ancient building. 
   A set of extremely sturdy stairs lead back towards the hustle

It is neatly-kept and well-organized, lined with shelves and

away at a large cavern, though the walls are fairly smooth and 
the floor clean.

Open Area of a Leather-Topped Structure~
   While the tent structure seems curtained off as it curves 
around an odd corner, this area is the largest section of the 
tent, open and leaving room for the scattered tools and equipment 
that fill the space. Stitched leather and wood have formed the 
walls and flat ceiling, foul weather often causing the hides to 
droop in places. The ground itself is packed dirt covered in a 
collection of worn rugs. 
   An open doorway to the north leads out into the communal work 
area of the Outpost. Two curtained doorways lead into other 
areas of the tent structure, the east a small storage room and 
the south a sleeping area.

seeps in here from cracks in the hides that make up this tent, 
and the lack of travel to and from this room is notable. Mud and 
packed dirt make up the floor of this room, with a large, flat 
stone set near the doorway in an attempt to cover a stubborn 
puddle. 
   A single hide-covered doorway leads back to the west.

Rustic Stables Next to a Watchtower~
   These stables are fairly rustic in design but they are 
well-kept and easily large enough to accommodate the horses of 
the Watchtower inhabitants. They are constructed of stone walls 
and solid wood support beams and rafters. There are several 
carvings on the wood of horses and their riders. The stables are 
divided into several stalls along the north and south walls, each 
with straw in them for bedding. The space between the stalls is 
floored with hard-packed dirt. Lamps hang from the ceiling to 
provide light whatever the time of night or day. An archway 
leads east to the courtyard.

Rustic Infirmary Inside a Watchtower~
   Originally the base of a ruined building, this room has been 
turned into a rustic infirmary. It carries ancient stone walls 
over a meter thick and a more recent stone pillar have been 
raised in the center of the room to ensure the stability of a 
stone ceiling that in parts came from the original building - but 
the old worn stones have been replaced in many places by freshly 
cut grey stone. The room is lined with shelves and crates, and 
several cots have been placed at even intervals for the sick or 
wounded. Lamps have been bolted to the walls to provide constant 
light. 
   A sturdy door stands to the west and another is set in the 
southern wall, leading down into a dark passage below.

Stone Hall and Jail~
   A stone stair, carved out of the southern wall, leads down to 
this room that is relatively square and dug out underneath the 
tower above. Its walls are of stone, as is the floor and 
ceiling, and there are crates and shelves stacked near the base 
of the staircase. Sconces are mounted in various places on the 
wall, holding torches to keep the cool room lit no matter the 
hour. 
   Three cage-like doors have been securely fashioned in the 
stone, dimly lit jail cells beyond each.

The Western Cell~
   Whatever hand crafted this prison was an expert one as the 
bars blend seamlessly with both the floor and the ceiling. Few 
errant tool marks score the floor near where the stout iron bars 
are driven into the bare stone slab. They are spaced evenly and 
close together, effectively preventing even the smallest of 
bipeds from squeezing through. The door to this room is made of 
the same bars as the rest of the cage, effectively providing a 
view to the outside room yet preventing escape. There are lamps 
high in the walls to provide light and shackles bolted to the far 
western wall.

Landing Just Before a Longhouse~
   The ground here is packed hard with dirt and a narrow path 
runs from south to north toward the large front door of a 
fire-hardened wooden longhouse. There is grass on either side to 
the east and west, and a low fence forming a boundary around this 
front area. Iron and glass lamps bolted into the longhouse outer 
walls create light here, at any time of day or night. Large 
double doors lead into the house northwards.

Main Living Area of a Longhouse~
   This living area and kitchen takes up most of the space inside 
this rustic longhouse. Like the rest of the building it is 
constructed in a rectangular shape of fire-hardened wood with 
high walls and roof. Dominating the middle of the room is a long 
oaken table, with a fireplace and stove lining the walls. 
Trophies and odd baubles are displayed on the walls all around 
and a doorway to the north leads to the women's quarters.

Cramped Tool and Storage Area~
   Dug out of the mountain itself and then reinforced with packed 
dirt and logs, this cellar is cool and damp no matter the time of 
year. Clutter in the form of crates, shelves and goods fill this 
small space, barely leaving room for easy motion. Nonetheless, 
there is a constant flow of traffic through this room by way of 
the sturdy wooden ladder that leads to the trapdoor above.

A Dark Lair~
   A very large, dark room stretches out before you. It has been 
hacked out of hard packed dirt and stone by the hand of time and 
possibly the beasts that reside here. Scattered over the hard 
floor are cleanly gnawed bones from various beasts and humanoids. 
Beds made out of leaves and grass are placed all over the lair 
and upon them you might find resting wargs or wolves with their 
pups. The canine beasts wander freely across their lair, 
snapping their teeth, snarling and growling. In the far 
northeastern corner there is an area cleared of any beds or 
bones, instead it is filled with various goods of a far more 
civilized nature. The smell of the animals that live in the cave 
lies ever present, only broken by the occasional strong wind that 
manages to find its way into the cave from the outside.

A Spacious Tent~
   The inside of this tent is cramped as stacked crates and bins 
along the sides hold the many goods and produce sold here. A 
mixture of smells and noises circulate the room as various 
customers pick over the offerings presented. The leather is worn 
and cracked in several places that have been patched rather 
crudely. To the east, a smaller section of the tent opens up, 
while the south leads back to the marketplace.

racks of kitchenware. Pots, pans, and various assorted cookware 
hang in a tangled mass, clanging about as customers go by. The 
leather walls of this tent are stitched poorly in a few places, 
allowing shards of light to penetrate the interior. Two dented 
lanterns dangle on both sides of the western opening which leads 
out to the main tent.

Inside A Lumber Mill~
   This area is full with the buzz of the sawmill, reaching a 
deafening level. This complex piece of machinery is a mass of 
metal cogs, wheels and sawblades, fed with the power of the 
nearby brook, propelling it into life to work the hefty logs that 
are set to it. The smell of oil and water used to cool the 
blades mixes with the strong smells of the wood chips which cover 
the floor. Logs and long lengths of cut timbers are orderly set 
around the floor, either to be taken into the warehouse for 
storage or readied to be cut at the mill. A heavy set of oak 
doors secure the building.

The Lumbermill Yard~
   When in use, this large yard is filled with laborers hauling 
freshly cut logs and setting them to be turned into lumbers at 
the lumbermill, which fills the air with a constant roar of metal 
on wood. Yet, despite the noise, those who dwell and work here 
are tense and speak in low voices, glancing to the gates 
frequently and finishing their tasks with haste. A warehouse 
with an arched roof sits in the western half of the yard, 
surrounded by barrels of water, ladders and buckets. To the 
south the noisy lumbermill is powered by the fast brook flowing 
down from the mountains. The packed-dirt of the yard is grooved 
and churned up by carts and wagons. Surrounding the yard and 
lumbermill is a tall palisade. A large log-gate set in the 
northern section is normally barred with fire-hardened trunks, 
except to allow access or egress. From under the gate chains and 
ropes are set around a large iron pole and secured in place. 
Sentries constantly patrol the platform behind the staked wall 
during the day, though none reveal themselves at night.

Logging Warehouse with A Peaked Roof~
   The pungent, rich scents of oil, lumber and fresh-cut logs 
hang heavy in this peak-roofed building. Normally half-filled 
with stacked lumber ready for being carted off, or logs waiting 
to be planed, this warehouse is accessed through a large, wide 
doorway that rattles on its hinges. Above, eaves rise as the 
A-shaped roof keeps away the worst of the elements, as well as 
the lit torches and worse of any who might attack this building.

Clearing Containing A Palisaded Logging Mill~
   Nestled amid large boulders and cracked rock slates with the 
roots of ancient trees pushing through, a large clearing is 
mostly taken up with a high palisade of sharpened stakes and a 
ditch. Within can be seen a large lumbermill and an arch-roofed 
wooden building. A single gate in the northern section is the 
only obvious access, a wide bridge of logs laying across the 
ditch in normal times. Chains and ropes lead from the bridge 
under the gate and inside the compound. Grey-blue shards of 
rocks, light green moss and rugged mountain cedars lighten the 
clearing. A heavy fall on the western flanks of a rising hillock 
pushes a rushing stream down under the palisade and through the 
lumbermill, then flows out again westwards where it winds apace 
among the stratiated, slippery descent of granite and slate.

here, and fertile, the soil underfoot soft and damp. Past the 
fencing, some wilderland can be seen, the towering trees 
providing a meager amount of shade from their positions far 
beyond the fence. The farmland continues south and west.

   Flat, cultivated pasture spans this area, fenced in to the 
north and west by sturdy posts. The land is divided by numerous 
paths cutting small parcels with crops in various stages of 
growth. Few trees line the edge of the farmland, offering shade 
to the few animals grazing. The farmland continues to the east 
and south, while west leads through a gap in the fence.

   This land is fertile enough to provide a decent place for

the height of a man's knees while the soil underfoot is soft and 
damp, rich for farming. However, towards the south and west, 
where a fence borders this area from the woodlands beyond, the 
grasses give way to a harder, packed dirt, marred with pebbles 
and a few clumps of weeds that sprout here and there. To all 
other directions, the farmlands continue.

Women's Bunkroom~
   Built from floor to ceiling of long, circular logs, this room 
has been outfitted to make the most of the space. Windows in the 
northern and eastern walls provide light at all times of the day, 
and lanterns are mounted at intervals upon the wall at easy 
reach. The bunks that line the walls are all aligned in an even 
fashion, causing the room to stretch further than its moderate 
size. 
   A thick hide curtain hangs over the doorframe to the south.

A Run-Down Cell~
   Confining walls roughly-hewn from solid rock hem this small 
room in on three sides while a narrow, iron-barred doorway leads 
to the east. The air is quite stuffy in here and dank though the 
room itself is quite clean.

A Dank Cellar~
   This dark, musty space appears to be a natural cavern which 
has experienced a bit of shoring up with stone masonry which has 
been recently-repaired. The cellar is still dank and a bit musty 
from being underground though it is definitely secure and sturdy. 
A narrow stair leads up while clean, iron doors lead east and 
west here downstairs.

A Large, Oddly-Shaped Room~
   This room is fairly spacious but oddly shaped as if its design 
was that of a natural cavern. The ceiling slopes down towards 
the back as the unpaved, natural stone floor slopes up. The 
cavern extends a good twenty, or thirty paces in all directions 
before running into walls of solid rock except the western side 
where the wall is formed by heavy stone and a heavy, iron door. 
   A solid iron-door lies at the side of the doorway, ripped off 
its hinges. The room stinks of garbage and rotting meat, heaps 
of trash and bones littering the room. Two large nests have been 
built in the far eastern part of the room, made up out of bones, 
old clothes and equipment.

A Grey-Stone Great Hall~
   This large, round room takes up almost the entirety of the 
ground floor of the tower. The floor is made of grey cobbles, 
the stones worn smooth from age but matching in color as the dark 
grey stones that make up the rest of the great hall. Sections of 
the room seem to be newly-repaired and the floors and wall are 
unnaturally clean. Two sets of paired, stone columns march down 
the center of the room, meeting in the center and aligned in 
north to south and east to west directions and fireplace is set 
in the very center of the room at the column's axis. 
   The stench of fire-smoke, moldy food, rotting garbage and piss 
lingers here. Symbols of a burning hand and a closed fist have 
been painted on the walls, the paint itself looking crusted and 
very dark-red in color. Amongst cleanly gnawed bones, heaps of 
trash and manure one can spot traces of small fires that once 
scorched the floor.

A Pie-Slice-Shaped Room~
   This room sits atop a spiral set of stairs and seems to be 
recently repaired. The room is fairly large, seeming to be about 
a quarter of the tower and is recently-repaired, the oaken beams 
that make up the floor replaced in some places with different, 
newer wood. There is a fireplace at the point of the pie slice 
and center of the tower. 
   Hallways branch off to the north and south though a sturdy 
door is set, leading into a private chamber to the west.

The Northern End of the Hallway~
   This hallway leads to some private bedchambers, doors set to 
either side. It is permanently lit at all times by a brass 
lantern that has been affixed to the wall at the dead end, though 
an arrow slit to the north allows a sliver of daylight to shine 
in. The hallway continues south towards what can be seen of a 
pie-sliced-shaped room. 
   The hallway is filled with trash and garbage. Along the walls 
there are symbols of a burning hand and a clenched fist, all 
painted with some dark, crusty color.

ancient wood and stone. Doorways open to the east and west here 
and the sounds of people bustling about the tower drifts in soft 
murmurs, echoing through the stone walls. The hall continues 
further north to a pie-slice-shaped room.

A Private Apartment~
   The only major damage to this room seems to be caused by time, 
the wooden floorboards beneath scuffed and worn smooth, but 
despite their creaking, the room is stable and sturdy. A 
repaired section in the northern corner is visible with new 
mortar and stone and small window with an old, curtain of heavy 
linen overlooks the outside. 
   Orkish symbols of various kinds have been painted on the walls 
of this room, in blood. Trashed furniture and some pieces of 
burnt bones litter the floor.

A Large Barracks~
   This room takes up slightly over a quarter of the tower's 
area. The roof above the warped oak floor is intact, places 
showing where holes have been patched to block out the elements 
though there is an arrow slit in the northern wall, allowing a 
small view outside. The floors and walls are clean and the walls 
are reinforced by heavy, grey stone as the pie shaped confines of 
the room narrow towards the fireplace. 
   A doorway leads to the east back into the hall. Dozens of 
nest have been built in the room, made up out of bones, cloth and 
other things of a more questionable nature. Small heaps of 
rotting meat and scorched equipment lies scattered amongst broken 
furniture. The stench of piss and booze drifts about the room.

obviously recently-repaired, new wood showing here and there. 
Arrow slits are cut into the eastern and southern walls, allowing 
a bit of daylight to shine in though the room is well-lit by

A Serviceable, Stone Kitchen~
   This room does not take up quite so much space of the tower 
floor, the area small but serviceable. There is a large 
fireplace with a length of iron in it set in one wall while meat 
hooks have been hung in the corner out of the way. The walls and 
roof seem to be newer than the rest of the tower itself, 
obviously repaired and the kitchen as a whole is relatively 
clean. 
   An archway to the west leads out into the Great Hall. Blood 
has been smeared on the walls and the floor. In one corner lies 
the burnt remains of a child, its bones gnawed and suckled clean 
from any meat.

including the ceiling and floors. A narrow arrow-slit in the 
western wall allows daytime to filter in though otherwise, the 
room is absolutely secure, including the heavy door to the east 
that leads back into the hallway. 
   The stench of rotting and fresh meat strikes anyone who enters 
here. Heaps of flesh lying in large piles all across the room.

An Overrun Courtyard Before the Immense Ruins of an Ancient Tower~
   An expansive, overrun courtyard spans the area before the 
impressive sight of a collapsed and ruined ancient tower. Wild 
plants and ivy cover much of the yard, swallowed by the broken 
stone of the tower. An old well sits off to the right side of 
the yard, some cleared rubble lying around it. A cobbled path 
divides the yard in half, the western leading off to a rickety 
stables, while the right looks to have once served as a training 
grounds. 
   The western stables seems to barely be holding up in the face 
of the tower ruins, so heavily eaten by fire. All of the area 
seems to have been subjected to many fires, the ground being 
heavily marred and ruined by the flames. Pieces of broke glass 
lies scattered amongst various debris, rubble and the whitish 
bones of fighters that could not escape the flames in time. 
There is a horrible stench that seems ever present here amongst 
the fire-ravaged ruins.

A Humble, Old Stable~
   The stables smell of fire and dust, the walls and ground 
completely scorched by the deadly flames. There are traces of a 
roof having once rested upon the rickety wooden skeleton that 
makes up the stable walls and foundation. Most of the stalls are 
burnt down or simply broken to pieces, although one or two seems 
to be in decent condition. Leading downards there is a rusted 
old iron trap door and to the east the remains of a burnt down 
wooden door.

   This spacious and open hall serves as a throughway between 
areas of the longhouse, some curtained off by thick, hanging 
hides. An arching ceiling created by thick, wooden beams rising 
above, lit by an iron candelabra on a thick, iron chain. Hunting 
trophies are mounted on the walls, some small and others large if 
not grotesque. Raucous laughter often floats in from the 
bunkroom to the north, chatter filtering into the hallway.

   Like the rest of the building, this room is made of logs, 
floor to ceiling. It is large, though only allows a moderate 
amount of space, most of the room taken up by the many bunks that 
line the walls, matching lockers set at the foot of each bed. 
Two windows with hide curtains have been built into the north and 
western walls, allowing light to shine in through the daytime 
though lanterns have been set equally-spaced here and there, to 
provide ample lighting in the evening. 
   A curtained doorway to the south serves as the bunk room's

Mess Hall~
   This mess hall is spacious and though not grand, the 
construction simple and sturdy. Giant logs of ancient trees 
criss-cross here, forming the walls of the longhouse which have 
been thoroughly chinked with clay, long hardened. The ceilings 
are high, thick, oaken beams overhead in the rafters to where the 
roof slopes upward to a shallow crest. Spread out across the 
room are a number of tables, each long, their surfaces well-worn 
though still of good use are left in the hard wood. Cut into the 
eastern wall here are wide windows, curtained by undyed hide. 
   Hides of varying colors have been stitched together and hung 
in the doorway to the north, while the way west is clear of 
obstruction, leading to the entryway of the longhouse.

A Dank, Collapsed Cellar~
   Worn timbers, thick with dust and abandoned spider webs line 
the ceiling of this cramped cellar. The floorboards above are 
ill-spaced leaving gaps that allow dirt and debris to fall 
through. The floor is a sodden mound of dirt and debris, 
trampled by countless numbers of feet in days gone by. The walls 
are composed of heavy flagstone which seems to have been 
neglected for many years, the mortar that once held them together 
crumbling to gather on the floor. 
   A decrepit set of narrow steps leads along the eastern wall to 
a moldy trap door above.

the stone floor is worn from time, the cobblestones smooth. The 
room bears no windows but to the east is a sturdy dorway. 
   The horribly strong stench of piss, manure and garbage is the 
first thing that hits someone entering the room. The second 
thing is the piles of manure, the puddles of urine and the heaps 
of garbage that litter the room.

A Private Bedchamber~
   The stone walls and floor of this private chamber are 
sparkling clean, though spots upon the walls show where fixtures 
had one been placed as the stone is lighter in those areas. A 
narrow slit sits on the eastern wall, providing a small amount of 
light to the room in daytime hours. Spread across the floor is a 
woolen rug, soft underfoot though the rest of the room, though 
modest in size, allows for the placing of a few pieces of 
furniture. 
   The stench of pain and death lingers in the room, not a light 
in sight. One large, mouldy old nest made with scorched bones 
and pale skulls sit along the eastern wall. The pictures of 
clenched fists have been painted in blood all over the room. 
Half-eaten corpses of animals and the occasional human lies in 
heaps, scattered throughout the room.

A Small Room~
   This small room is fit for one occupant, only room for a few 
furnishings though recesses have been built into the walls for 
where recently-replaced wooden slats serve as shelving. Narrow 
arrow-slits are set to the north and west, providing light in the 
daylight hours and a sturdy door opens out to the hallway to the 
east. 
   A large, burning hand have been painted on the western wall, 
painted in blood. Heaps of equipment and gear lies scattered 
around the room. Three nests made up out of old cloth and bones 
have been built and places in the room.

The Pre-Game Shop for Watchers of the Dale~
This is a special pre-game shop open exclusively to those who
are part of the clan Watchers of the Dale. If you are here, you
have been identified as having taken a role in that organization
and transferred here. If you believe this is in error, please
contact staff to get you out.
#0
In order to leave, you will have to have purchased, at least, 
one spear, one shield, one helmet, and one piece of chest armour.
You may purchase anything else you like, and you must have a
spear even if you cannot use it. It is simply a requirement of 
the organization.
#0
Once you type #6leave room#0, assuming you are correctly equipped,
you will be transferred to the regular Angost pre-game room, or
the room of study and luck if you qualify. So you do not have to
spend all of your coin here.
#0
#1Note: Due to a coding constraint, this room isn't properly set up
to actually check your equipment, and as such, all the equipment you
need has been put in the regular pre-game shop for your convenience.
Nonetheless, note that you MUST buy all that gear before you leave
the pregame area. Failure to do so could get you kicked out of the
Watchers of the Dale.#0

   This northern section of the main hall has been separated by a 
long, linen curtain, affording some privacy for those who rest 
and work within. The walls, other than the curtain, are made of 
the same grey stone as the rest of the building and the 
cobblestones underneath are worn underfoot. This area is 
relatively clean and kept free of dust and debris.

Small Sheltered Glade Within Timeless Woods~
   A thick screen of foliage hides the glade from the west and 
south, making it difficult to spot from outside the woods. Peace 
and tranquillity hang in the air, embracing the surrounding trees 
which bask in eternal good weather. Soft green moss covers the 
forest floor here, spreading over some large rocks on the eastern 
side. Behind the rocks is a small quiet pool of water, fed from 
a little stream that comes from deeper inside the forest. To the 
north, a taller, larger mallorn tree rises up, providing the 
greatest amount of shade and high within its crown of branches a 
flet can be seen. Smaller saplings of other trees grow about the 
glade and near the great rock is a clear area enough for a small 
campfire. Aside from the narrow path leading west into the 
wilds, the serene woods rise up all around.

Mossy Path Winding its Way Through the Woods~
   Wending its way from the garden and fountain to the west, this 
path continues on in an easterly direction. It moves among the 
trunks of mellyrn and other trees in a vaguely serpentine fashion 
toward a mossy clearing in the east where the forest is a little 
thinner. All about the path the sounds of the forest can be 
heard; birds and small animals and even the voices of Elves in 
the distance. By day the sunlight slants down through the tree 
tops above and by night, silver lamps hung at intervals in the 
lower branches illumine the way.

The Trader's Caravans~
   This small area, a juncture between the buildings of the 
Outpost is merely a yard of hard-packed dirt, small clumps of 
hardy weeds growing underfoot in several patches, the ground 
otherwise bare. Tents, carts, and wagons of different sizes, 
colors, and conditions collect here in one large caravan yard, 
the area rife with the noise and bustle of a large group living 
in close congress. Outpost citizens of every standing gather 
here, mingling with the merchants who barter loudly with goods 
from all over Middle-Earth, their shouts of products and prices 
adding to a great din. Several of the caravans wagons and tents 
have their doors and flaps open for business.

table and chairs dominates the room as the center of focus, 
placed right over a bearskin rug. Along the western wall runs a

to filter in during the day time. A curtained archway to the 
east leads into a small dormitory while the southern door allows 
one access to a private room.

serving as temporary bedding for those who make use of this

lighting. A staircase leads down to a door back into the mead

   A simple corridor leads onwards here, obviously created by 
human hands. The large blocks of stone that make up the walls, 
floor and ceiling are dark in color and cold to the touch. In 
fact the old, stuffy air seems to hold a constant cold, almost as 
if a light wind haunts the old corridor. Along the walls are 
several rows of script, interrupted only by the occasional 
carving of a ship or ocean.

   A solid wooden floor has been constructed here, supported on 
four tall logs that make it stand a good ten feet above the 
ground. The tower has a low wooden ceiling and well camouflaged 
railings. One can easily look out of the tower from between the 
large gaps between ceiling and wooden railing to keep an eye on 
the ground beneath. Several trees and bushes surround the 
lookout tower, creating a good camouflage. A narrow but simple 
ladder leads down to the ground from a hatch in the floor.

A Small, Tree-Lined Grove~
   A small clearing in a circle of coniferous trees, this grove 
offers shelter able to house a few. There is little foliage on 
the ground save a few ferns but the forest floor is otherwise 
covered in short grass. The boughs of the trees form a high 
canopy up above, shading the area from the worst of the elements 
while still allowing sunlight to illuminate the clearing during 
the daytime or the stars to shine their light during the night.

The Sealed Wall within the Mouth of a Cave~
   Droppings of different shapes and sizes litter the slope 
descending into this cave. Less than twenty strides in, the path 
ends abruptly into a massive granite wall. The wall has a crack 
that runs vertically down its center, though it is so narrow that 
not even a finger could slip between the two sections of granite. 
There are large, perfectly scrawled sigils carved neatly into the 
stone wall, and their entirety spans a couple of feet in width 
and thrice that in length. 
   A forgotten slope climbs up to the north from here to the 
mouth of the cave. Jagged rocks enclose upon the small entrance, 
and the maw of the cave barely opens enough to allow one average 
sized man through at a time.

Deep into the Cave, at a Fork~
   The stiffling space here, beneath the earth, is extremely 
cramped. It is wide enough for four men to croud together, 
shoulder to shoulder. The walls here are formed from smooth, 
damp stone, and putrid water pools together in places against the 
cave wall, no more than a couple of inches in depth. There is 
the very, very faint, but constant echo of watery droplets 
falling from the rocky roofing. 
   Three paths branch off from this fork. The western trail 
leads upward, through a narrow, natural hall. The way south 
tightens even more, and continues on the downward trend of the 
path. However, the cave opens up along the northern route, and 
the stone walls appear to widen more deliberately there.

cave. The stone here is smooth and flat, and the tell-tale signs 
of the sort of erosion caused by running water are present. 
There is an old, iron door set into the cave wall. Its metal is 
smooth, and unmarked by sigil or blemish, beyond layers of 
cobwebs at the door's head. 
   The cave floor leads to the west from the iron door, around a 
corner of the rocky wall, and then it twists sharply to the 
south. There, the walls restrict, and the level path stretches 
into the more confined tunnels of this place.

At a Steep Wall, Deep inside the Cave~
   A narrow tunnel leads to an abrupt stop here, with the rise of 
a sheer rock wall. The wall has several sets of large crevices, 
reaching from six or so feet above the ground, then re-appearing 
every foot or so upward. The surface of this wall is smoother 
than that of the rest of the tunnel, its angle growing in a 
vertical rise. Here, deep below the earth and within the cave, 
the air chills and the temperature drops noticeably. An odd 
draft sometimes picks up and breezes through, its gust fading 
just as suddenly into the small tunnel. 
   The tunnel retreats up a narrow slope to the north, away from 
the sudden and steep wall.

Through a Hole, before a set of Stone Stairs~
   Crawling out of the hole, it widens a little into a tunnel. 
But the tunnel does not go on for long. Instead it soon widens, 
stretches to become a large open area. The short tunnel seems to 
have been smoothened down by hand, but little else care has been 
tended to it. But the open area is taken up almost completely by 
a wide, stone stairway. The finely carved stairway leads to a 
wide doorway, opened, only darkness inside. On either side of 
the doorway and lining the stairs are old, rusted iron candle 
holders, but there are no candles left. Despite the size and how 
finely crafted the stairway seems to be, there are no ornaments 
or anything of the like.

obvious northman make have been cut along the stone of both floor 
and ceiling. Great pillars with the same kind of patterns as are

A Claustrophobic, Old Tomb~
   There is little room to manuever in the close confines of this 
dusty tomb. The cold stone floor is almost bare, save for small 
drains scattered about up against the tomb's walls. You can hear 
the faint noise of rushing water, and though the sound is merely 
an echo, its source must be somewhere nearby in this resting 
place beneath the mountain. Layers of dust, dirt, and spider 
webs clutter the walls and floor, though there is a white-washed 
sepulchre carved into the northern wall that seems less dirtied 
by time. 
   The only apparent escape from this place is the western door. 
Its heavy iron has a sturdy handle on this side, making it 
possible to open and close the heavy door from within the tomb.

   Striated rock of various grey and black shades compose this

height, this tunnel might provide discomfort and difficulty for

glowing slime left behind by the bioluminescent worms about the 
cavern adds another slippery mess to the damp, slick stone floor.

from the nearby passages mixing to create a confusing din. Small 
bits of quartz and other minerals in the otherwise uniform grey 
rock face allow for some degree of illumination within the den. 
The boney remains of some small unknown creatures litter the 
floor in several locations, crunching underfoot.

West of Intersecting Tunnels~
   Leading in from the intersecting tunnels, the walls constrict 
slightly as they slant off towards the west, the path only barely 
discernable. The squeaks and rustling of the tunnels' flying 
inhabitants provide some signs of life in this otherwise barren 
cave, but the enveloping dark and resounding echo offer little 
comfort. Patches of slick white guano streak the cave walls and 
floor in several spots, a mess awaiting the unwary visitor.

A Tunnel beneath the Mountain~
   Sitting about six feet high, this tunnel's walls are just tall 
enough to grant general passage. The dark grey stone composing 
this cave allows for little light to reflect from its surface, 
conceding nearly no visibility in any direction. Many dips and 
grooves in the floor make it uneven and difficult to cross, the 
slick walls of the tunnel providing limited assistance. A 
frequent chilly breeze rushes by from deep within the caves.

The Maw of an Underground Cave~
   The smaller tunnel passages of this cave system empty into 
this more open space. Dark like deepest midnight, few light 
sources would completely pierce the invasive shadows of this 
place, leaving the unwary at risk. Long and spindly soda-straws 
and larger stalactites drip water onto the floor, leaving several 
slippery puddles of copper-green mineral water. An enormous maw 
leads further into the caves against the western wall. 
Foreboding and pitch black nothing is visible beyond its borders.

Several long, stringy spiders' webs cling to the ceiling, their 
loose ends wafting in the slight breeze with the mass as a whole 
precariously shaking with the slightest tapping against the 
nearby cavern walls. Hemmed in by solid grey non-reflective rock 
on either side, returning to the south or heading towards the 
unknown darkness north remain the only options.

   Moving further through the blackened caverns, an incredible

carcass haphazardly strewn on the ground. The buzzing of flies 
echoes off the dark walls, creating a distasteful atmosphere. 
Copper-green water and bat viscera mix into a wet sticky mess 
hardly avoidable when moving through the narrow passage. 
Pressing forward towards the dark north or retreating to the 
south provides the only escape from this spot.

surface. Emerging from the dark northern rock face sits a

East of Intersecting Tunnels~
   Leading in from the intersection of tunnels behind, this 
channel constricts as it slopes downward towards the east. One 
large stalactite hangs low from the ceiling, dribbling a slow but 
steady fall of copper-green water onto the ground. The moist 
nature of this locale has invited the growth of an odd sticky, 
white fungus film that clings to the walls and any misguided 
hands. The mineral-laced water and fungi combine into a 
pestilent mildew smell that assaults the senses.

many wings alludes to the bat colony that inhabits this damp, 
cool passage, the floors and walls sticky with thick guano

unknown mammals crunch underfoot and reveal the many past meals

   Even on the calmest of days, gusts of wind whip over this 
hilltop wasteland. Much of the weedy clearing here is cast into 
shadow beneath the boughs of the huge, gnarled pine tree. There 
is not much else here in the way of plant life, but the hilltop 
does provide for a breath-takingly isolated view of the stark 
mountains rising up in the distance. The lonely pine tree is 
still alive, though much of its bark has been stripped, and its 
wood rotted in a few places. Its deformed trunk and ghoulish 
limbs twist upward, thirty or forty feet above the barren earth.

On a Huge, Twisted Tree Limb~
   This massive tree limb has had most of its bark stripped off 
and smoothed down to provide a relatively comfortable perch. 
From up here, one would have keen vantage point in any direction 
to the scenic lands surrounding the barren hillside. Though the 
deformed pine tree rises up ten feet above this limb, it twists 
in such a way that climbing further up it would mean certain 
death. The trunk would be far easier to scale back down to the 
hilltop below, however, despite the ocassional onslaught of 
sudden wind, which makes this precarious perch quite the unstable 
resting place.

western road. The landscape is nearly void of greenery and is 
dotted with stone reminders that this land is a resting place for 
the dead. Most of the stone markers are unmarked and do not 
stand out in the boneyard, though obvious care and heart has been 
put into a few of the memorials. An old, barely-trodded path 
winds northwards, into the deeper shadow of the mountain.

of an older time. The trail ends abruptly at the mouth to the

ceiling of cold stone. To the east, the darkness grows thicker,

with vicious intent. The earth bends into an easy ramp, lowering

rocks which stick out in irregular angles.

There are wide shelves here and a large stack of furs as a nest 
with a large stone slab for a table. A murky smell lies about, a 
reminder of badly aged meat and black-bloods. The crudely 
shaved, damaged walls are splashed with thick coats of black and 
red blood, each splashing unique in it's design. Several species 
of moss have grown here enthusiastically but the change of 
climate may have killed them slowly causing most of this room to 
look painted in a brown-red color.

Upon a Caravan Route Nearing the Druadan~
   An occasional wagon or traveller passes by on this worn 
caravan route bordered by grassy plains and large croppings of 
rocks that can frequently be seen along the countryside. To the 
southwest, the everpresent stretch of the White Mountains can be 
seen while to the southeast, the border of the Druadan forest 
lays within sight. Just to the north is the narrow passage of 
water into which the River Entwash flows, cold and clear. 
   #6OOC: If you are travelling from Angost to Gondor, your 
journey ends here. Before you continue, make sure that EVERYONE, 
including NPCs, types 'ADD CLANNING'. Then, if you are traveling 
with a group voucher, the group leader must type 'END JOURNEY' to 
be moved to the new sphere. If you are traveling without a 
voucher, or with a single voucher, then each individual and NPC 
must be made to type 'END JOURNEY' on their own. If you have a 
travel voucher, hold it in your hand to be taken to a secure 
location on the road before continuing onward. If you are just 
beginning your journey from Gondor to Angost, continue onwards!#0

A Route Curving South and West Along the River~
   As the caravan route continues, it begins to curve south and 
west around a large boulder protruding in the round at the shore 
of the River Entwash that is covered in moss and by the tall 
cattails that grow around it. Despite the long distance between 
this route and the Misty Mountains, its peaks are easily visible 
to the west, tended fields lined up against the mountain's sheer 
slopes that loom high, promising an early sunset.

West of a Caravan Route That Passes Near to a River~
   Lying to the north and east of this grassy, boulder-studded 
fields is trail that snakes through the boulders and small 
hillocks to move away from the distant White Mountains and 
Druadan Forest of the south. About this area, the vegetation 
stands about waist high, and it is comprised of almost entirely 
grassy plants. Within the grasses, the sound of small animals 
can often be heard.

A Route Snaking Through Grassy Hillocks~
   While the grasses grow high, almost to knee-height, so do the 
hillocks that rise to either side of the path as it progresses 
through the area, nearing ever closer to a stretch of the White 
Mountains that loom to the west. The fields are lush and alive 
with wildlife, little animals ocassionally seen darting closer to 
the route. A few travellers can be seen progressing along the 
seemingly endless trail, journeying alongside other caravans that 
follow the River Entwash. The route itself is merely nothing 
more than grass and dirt, hard-packed beneath the passage of many 
feet over time.

far off to the southwest are the peaks of the White Mountains, 
looming high over the expanse of forest that can be seen further 
southeast. The path follows along the shore of a river of cold, 
rushing waters, vegetation growing lushly upon its shore. 
   Further north, a river can be seen running east and west, a 
wooden bridge allowing passage across it.

Crossing Over A Narrow River~
   Here, an ill-maintained bridge crosses over the a river 
running east and west to flow into the larger waters of the River 
Entwash. Large logs and timber are supported by river rocks at 
the foundation and the structure is altogether ancient, creaking 
loudly as travellers pass across it. Beneath, the cold water 
rushes quickly, easily sweeping away any who may fall within its 
treacherous depths. 
   North of the bridge, the vibrant green grasses of the fields 
continue, tall and knee-high.

   Lying just to the south of here, a river bisects the rugged 
trail that weaves through the small hillocks of this grassy land. 
Providing passage over the river, an aged wooden bridge stands 
with the support of large timbers planted firmly on a foundation 
of river rocks. The bridge, despite being aged and seeming 
somewhat precarious is a far more preferable option to the cold, 
treacherous waters that run along the river.

begin leading northward towards the distant Misty Mountains that 
loom far off in the distance. Upon either side of this trail, 
tall grasses rise up to cover the hillocks. Dotting the 
landscape the occasion boulder may be spotted residing upon any 
given hill of this area. 
   The frequent chirp and chatter of small animals can be heard 
coming from within the concealment of the grass that borders the 
road.

through the hills that cover this landscape. The hillocks are 
then dotted with boulders of varying size, and each bears a tall 
stand of grass that covers all the areas about this foot-worn 
path. All about, the evidence of wildlife can be heard coming 
from the grasses, but seldom can any of these creatures be seen.

boulder of grey stone rises up to stand dominant over the path. 
Weathered and worn, this boulder mirrors the many that are 
scattered upon the surrounding hillocks, the old and weathered 
stone that dot the hills nearly entirely consumed by the tall 
grasses that rise up from the soil of the hills.

would be difficult to travel in a hard winter, but during warmer

the borders of a very expansive forest.

hard-packed by the passage of many travellers over time but 
ill-maintained, potholes in the ground besides dangerous rocks 
and pebbles bound to damage many a wagon wheel.

here. Approaching an old bridge, the rough trail proceeds 
towards the waters to the north and to the east, the trail 
disappears into the darkness.

Crossing a Rickety Bridge~
   Here, an old wooden bridge makes its way over the fast-flowing 
waters that surge below. Although the bridge does not look very 
sturdy, it yet remains standing, the only link between the two 
sides of the river. Often the mist from the cool river sprays 
up, the moisture cool, yet not icy.

   To the south of here, a running river cuts through the deep 
forest, bisecting this trail and leaving it sundered save for the 
presence of the old and rickety wooden bridge that stands above 
the waters. The bridge to the south looks uncertain, but from

A Trail Leading North and South~
   Passing through the midst of the Fangorn Forest, this old 
forest trail is a rugged path that is often interrupted by the 
presence of a large root or the occasional stone. Dark and 
somewhat sinister, the trees rise up either east or west of this 
path in an eerie, disquieting manner.

   Dark and foreboding ill omen, the tall trees of varying 
species that compose the Fangorn Forest seem particularly 
uninviting. Here at the heart of the forest, this appearance is 
none the exception. The density of the trees cause little light 
to ever reach the floor and make this place quite dark even at 
high sun.

An Unpaved Road Passing Through The Fangorn Forest~
   Unpaved and unsmoothed, this dirt trail is a rough course that 
is broken up by the presence of roots and head-sized rocks. 
Although this path would be a danger to the wheels of a wagon, 
this trail offers sufficient room to allow at least two carts to 
pass one another breast with sufficient clearance before the 
trees rise up just beyond the edge of the trail.

carts or pedestrians to easily move through the gloom of Fangorn

of trees that stand all about here in the heart of the forest.

A Swampy Chasm beneath the Ravine~
   Caged in by the sheer cliff walls, the ground of this area is 
soft and moist, slowly swallowing anything weighty. Sporadic 
growths of moss and scraggly bushes dot the landscape, and the 
occasional rocky outcropping provides a scant amount of shelter. 
Long, menacing shadows reach across the swampy ground from the 
cliffs above, casting this ravine into gloom. Large clusters of 
silvery-grey webbing cling to any crevice and corner, some ragged 
and fluttering in the wind, others taut and fresh. Around each 
web are scatterings of old bones and smears of blood, reaching 
far up on the looming cliffs in places. 
   A stack of flattened rocks pile in the northernmost area of 
this narrow swampland, leaving a hazardous climb back up into the 
opening ravine. In the southernmost section, a wide, deepening 
pit sinks into the earth, the pitch black hole covered with 
sticky webbing.

A Sun-Forsaken Nest~
   A forlorn shaft of bleak light falls into the middle of this 
cavernous hive, accomplishing little more than adding treacherous 
shadows. Throughout the underground lair, webbing has been spun 
thick and dense, creating walls and tunnels of matte white 
everywhere. Cocoons litter most surfaces in chaotic clusters, 
and strewn among them are the ghastly remains of creatures both 
humanoid and otherwise, most seemingly sucked dry of moisture and 
left as wrinkled husks. The air is heavily humid and stifling, 
the stench a relentless assault on the senses, and movement 
through the sticky nest is almost impossible. In the back of the 
hive is a gigantic shelter spun between three stalagmites, and 
variously shaped lumps encased in the tough, white strings hang 
limply from the protective webbing. An unspeakably strong odor 
of death and decay wafts from within, and escape can only be 
found through the difficult climb back onto the swampy ground 
above.

   Claustrophobia clings to those within the kitchen, close air 
lending its hand in such an effect. Lining the walls are 
numerous cupboards and shelves, their haphazard layout 
interrupted only by the odd scone. The hardwood floor is scuffed 
and worn, numerous stains and scratches marking the surface. A 
large pantry occupies a corner of this musty room, rising up 
towards the ceiling and swathed in cobwebs which spread to the 
other shadowy recesses. The center is occupied by a solid wooden 
bench, the surface covered in a myriad of nicks and cuts.

continuing as far as the eye can see. Massive beams support the 
high ceiling which is broken by a chimney rising up from the 
floor and into the cold air outside. Tapestries hang from the 
walls in contrast to the rest of the building, depicting 
crest-helmed figures locked in eternal combat. A section of the 
floor has been cleared near the stairwell, scuffed hardwood 
exposed, a weapons rack nearby. Not lacking in decoration, a

A Spacious, Dimly-Lit Foyer~
   Regardless of the hour, darkness holds sway over this 
expansive foyer. While the door out is heavily reinforced from 
the inside, the opposing portal to the living room is but only a 
frame that offers a peek at its better lit interior. The floor 
has been shaded with heavy rugs in the favor of dark patterns - 
this effect is helped by the walls, they are windowless and bare. 
The single object of decoration is the overhead chandelier, 
bronze at that, and perhaps a nod towards a style of living 
greater than the austerity of its surrounds.

Beyond an Earth Bank, Within a Clearing of Woodland~
   Beyond a large bank of solidly compacted soil, cropped with 
thick vegetation, a clearing in the woods greets newcomers. The 
air here is funneled cleanly through the sparsely planted tree 
trunks. The wind whistles a haunting tune through the limbs of 
the woods. The sun, when up, burns through the canopy of 
branches, lighting the area up for at least half of the day. 
Centered more so in the middle of the clearing, a stone pit has 
been setup, with this comes the possibility of a campsite, which 
looks to have been used at some stage, according to the story 
charcoal-black rocks tell. Several large, oil-lit lanterns have 
been fastened to nearby trees, tacked with rusted nails.

Between Two Grassy Knolls~
   Hidden between two, grassy knolls is this cleared area which 
is not easily seen from the caravan route to the east, making it 
the perfect place for bandis or other dangers to lurk. The long, 
yellowish-green blades of grass rise to almost knee-height here, 
easily hiding animals or tiny creatures within.

A Patch of Trees Before the Forest~
   Before Fangorn Forest, this small patch of trees is 
tightly-knit as still the knee-high grasses of the fields mix 
with the undergrowth of vegetation. The closer to the forest 
this area goes, the more dense the amount of trees, allowing 
plenty of places to hide for potential dangers.

Crossing a Rickety Bridge~
   Here, an old wooden bridge makes its way over the fast-flowing 
waters that surge below. Although the bridge does not look very

up, the moisture cool, yet not icy.

In A Copse of Trees Away from the Caravan Route~
   The scent of moss mixed with decaying leaves and crisp pine 
assaults the senses in this copse of aged trees. Massively 
trunked firs arch their firm boughs high into the skies, muting 
any light in this expanse of trees. Moss and needles from the 
trees creep across the ground like a thick carpet, encroaching 
and occasionally enveloping small stones that pepper between 
strong, gnarled roots which, meandering from their individual 
trees, taper into the moss.

An Underwater, Old Tomb~
   There is little room to manuever in the close confines of this 
dusty tomb. The cold stone floor is almost bare, save for small 
drains scattered about up against the tomb's walls. Layers of 
dust, dirt, and spider webs clutter the walls and floor, though 
there is a white-washed sepulchre carved into the northern wall 
that seems less dirtied by time. In the darkness of the 
water-filled tomb, it is only an eerie glow emanating from the 
stone itself that makes sight possible here. 
   The only apparent escape from this place is the western door. 
Its heavy iron has a sturdy handle on this side, making it 
possible to open and close the heavy door from within the tomb. 
However, the freezing water filling this room make moving the 
door an impossibility.

A Well Constructed Talan Ringing a Large Mallorn Tree~
   Constructed of wood, stained and treated against weathering, 
the front half of the talan encircles the bole of the mighty 
mallorn and continues out of sight behind the trunk. The boards 
radiate outwards from the trunk like the spokes of a wheel, each 
lain with a very slight space between it and the next, to allow 
air to pass through and any water to drain. Four and a half 
paces wide from trunk to edge along its entirety, the platform 
offers ample living space. A tightly woven screen sits upon the 
edge of the talan and can be adjusted to provide protection from 
the blowing winds. Though open to the air, the floor is 
protected by the healthy canopy of the mallorn above, the dense 
leaves keeping off the better part of the rain and providing a 
burnished golden ceiling in the winter and a radiant silver roof 
in the spring, punctuated with delicate, golden flowers. 
   A small hole near the trunk allows access to the talan by means 
of a ladder lowered to the ground and brought up when not in use.

The Shaded Rear of the Talan~
   The northerly half of the talan stands most often in the shade 
of the trunk of the tree, while Anor rides the southerly skies. 
Perhaps due to the oft dimmed light, or the sound of the wind as 
it gently shakes the leaves, a restful feeling lies upon this 
side of the platform. The adjustable screen can be shifted from 
the other side of the platform to guard against the northerly 
winds and protect the occupants on this side from winter's chill. 
In the leafy canopy above, beyond the edge of the platform, is a 
break in the leaves which allows a view of the sky above. During 
the long nights of winter, Menelvagor, the Swordsman of the Sky, 
can be seen in full through this break as he keeps his vigilant 
march through the sky, guarding the lands below.

A Small Platform Set in the Crown of the Mallorn~
   Accessed by an easy climb from the platform below, this small 
platform has room for four people if they keep close quarters. 
Set in the crown of the mighty tree, the view on all sides is 
breathtaking. To the north, east, and south, the regal carpet of 
Lothlorien spreads, green in the spring and gold in the fall, an 
unbroken blanket of tall, mighty, beautiful trees. To the west 
the edge of the forest can be seen and close watch can be kept 
upon the lands leading to it. Above, the whole of the sky can be 
seen, the dome of the heavens falling to the horizon in every 
direction. The lofty height is seldom without a wind, gentle or 
strong, carrying a delicious scent of living, growing things, a 
wind that carries the words of those upon the platform away with 
it, providing some privacy from anyone that may reside upon the 
talan below.

A Generous Sitting Area and Entry to the Cottage~
   A wide curve-topped door sits in the southern wall with a 
narrow wood-framed window to either side of it. Fine linen 
curtains dyed a pale green hang from an iron bar over each window 
and are just long enough to cover the bottom window sill. A 
reinforced oak shutter hangs to one side of the window and can 
easily be barred over it with an iron rod to offer security. A 
vast rug of dark green wool runs nearly the full length of the 
room, sparing only a couple of feet to either side that exposes 
the wooden floor. The flooring and the walls are both wrought of 
wooden planks, thick and sanded smooth, cut from pine and treated 
with a polish that makes the wood an earthier shade then natural. 
The exposed beams of the thatched roof are thick and patterned 
with the knots of past branches and criss-cross throughout the 
high ceiling. Strung in strategic intervals on thin iron chains 
from a few beams are simple iron lanterns fixed with green glass 
panes. To the north rests a wide dark-stained pinewood door.

A Spacious Kitchen and Dining Area~
   Warm, orange light shines from a series of iron oil lamps 
mounted on thin iron chains strung from several exposed pinewood 
logs that criss-cross throughout the high, thatch-roofed ceiling 
as support beams. Covering nearly half of the western wall is 
white-washed river-rock that encases a wide fireplace that offers 
both heat and the ability to prepare meals. A long, rectangular 
dark green wool rug runs the length of the stone-adorned wall 
where a dining table is meant to stand. The floorboards and 
walls are made up of broad pinewood planks that have been sanded 
smooth and treated with an earthy stain. A small trap-door rests 
in the floor within the northwestern corner of the room.

Before A Longhouse With Green Windows~
   Thick pinewood logs have been secured at twelve foot intervals 
to form the supporting frame of this cottage's high-set thatched 
roof. Each wall is low and constructed of broad wooden planks 
that have been sanded smooth and white-washed, giving an overall 
feel of being well-maintained. A wide curve-topped door made of 
reinforced oak and painted vivid bright green allows entrance 
into one end of the structure. Two narrow windows sit to either 
side of the door, the frames and shutters painted vivid bright 
green as each glass pane is cut to fit the diamond-shaped pattern 
of the iron casing. The cottage sits to the north of the 
plateau.

Within a Covered Trench~
   This end of the trench is accessible by a crude flap, and is 
mostly sheltered from the elements - with three hard-packed dirt 
walls, a greased burlap tarp stretched over it, and excess burlap 
hanging as a stiff flap, trapping in heat. The floor is slightly 
uneven: all black, pebbly dirt and small stones - hard-packed in 
some places, and in others still loose and soft. The burlap tarp 
sits at a diagonal - running from the low wall above the trench, 
to the far end of the trench where it has been staked into the 
earth - and this angle allows for some air to filter in and out, 
not entirely enclosing the trench but rather shading it from the 
worst of any weather.

a fast-flowing stream that heads to the east. Ledges and crags

body of water to the stone edge. A few birch trees cling to the 
water's edge, rising to find the slanting light above as it 
trickles into the culvert.

   Worn smooth by the passage of water in centuries past, this 
cave is wide and round with smooth walls of slick, slightly damp 
stone. The rounded opening of the cave is about eight feet 
across, where a small waterfall once flowed. Inside, the cave 
widens out, bending around some hard granite in a gentle curve. 
A narrow shaft cut by the old water flow leads upward at an angle 
from the roof of the cave, creating a natural draft and drawing 
smoke up and out. At the back of the cavern is a gaping hole 
leading down, water flowing along the back wall from above into 
the lower chamber. Iron pitons secure a heavy rope ladder at its 
edge.

numerous crevices. Despite the uneven ground, it is possible to 
venture deeper, with what might be several tunnels branching off

splattering somewhere in the darkness. The cold air is almost

A Great, Silver-Lit Hall High in a Mallorn Tree~
   The arched stair opens onto a wide platform immediately before 
an expansive great-talan that rests proudly in the mallorn crown. 
Its roof has many arches, those highest in the middle and silken 
curtains of silver and white drape down, illumined by the 
lanterns and decorated with silver chimes. The hall itself is 
wide and round, its floor shaped like a single great leaf, and 
its support beams seemingly a part of the immense tree itself. 
Many open exits lead to narrow bridges that span the distance 
between trees to other telein. In the centre of the hall is a 
large round table in the shape of a sickle and there are other 
pieces of furniture, divans and chairs for comfort and 
merry-making. The air is filled with gentle woodland noises and 
the sound of Elves singing in the trees.

Fountain Garden Within the Golden Wood~
   A narrow forest path winds through the woods and finishes 
here, in a deep clearing. Some stone steps, seemingly a natural 
formation, lead down into a wide area that is framed with ledges 
of rock and the roots of larger trees. The soil and stone are 
covered with soft green moss. The air is calm and quiet, lit by 
the Sun during the day, and silver lanterns at night. Golden 
flowers adorn the rocky edges of the sunken clearing and in its 
centre is a stone fountain, bubbling with crystal-clear water. 
North of this at the base of the largest mallorn is a winding, 
arched stair that goes up around the trunk to a great talan 
above. The stair is quietly lit day and night by silver 
lanterns. Looking up there are several flets high in the trees 
and sometimes figures walking upon them. A mossy woodland path 
disappears away to the east where the forest thins.

Hilly Dell Deep in Mallorn Woodlands~
   The carpet of the forest rises and falls in easy, graceful 
hills, mature trees blanketing the hillsides. Ancient, mighty 
mallorn trees dominate the overstory, providing a silvered roof 
in the spring and summer, and a golden one in the autumn and 
winter. Beneath these giants grow trees of all kinds, each in 
the flourish of health and vitality. Despite the vast variety of 
trees, each grows within its own space, uncrowded, as if the 
forest is in perfect harmony. Smaller shrubs and thickets stand 
beneath the trees, and the floor of the forest is covered in soft 
grass that fades to moss in shadier areas. Where the hills rise 
slightly higher the forest cover thins and between two of the 
hills is a secluded dell, flat bottomed and carpeted with thick 
grass.

Quiet Stone Storage Room in a Smithy~
   This room is almost part of the main smithy itself. Its outer 
wall is round like the workshop itself and it is similarly lit by 
the same lamps. Only the wall to the south is straight. The 
ceiling is high for a tall elf to walk with ease through it and 
there are many well-laid out crates and shelves for the storage 
of several items. Even in here, the sounds of the woodland can 
still be heard.

A Sheltered Cavern~
   Turning back on itself through a narrow passage, this open 
cavern appears naturally formed, the walls slick and worn. The 
shifted shards of mountainous rock that split through the floor 
offer a concealed passage, both from the elements and passerby. 
The floor has been cleared of any debris, with only a few rough 
spots breaking through. A few spots along the wall have been 
carved out as makeshift shelves and a few flat rocks have placed 
in a ring around a blackened pit. An old moss-covered well 
formed from cavern rock holds some questionable looking water, 
and sanded plank boards can be moved to slip to the east.

The Weathered Wooden Gates of Audenshaw~
   A well-trodden dirt path winds up this hill, leading towards a 
quaint little hamlet which overlooks the Fangorn forest. A coat 
of grass, shrubs and rocks coats this hill, but very little 
wildlife is present - likely due to the large volume of traffic 
that passes through over this hill. The hamlet itself is 
encompassed by a worn wooden fence, rot and decay clearly visible 
on the wooden picket. 
   To the east, a commonly frequented campsite can be seen, and 
the road extends down the hill in the southern direction. A 
dilapidated pair of doors towards the north, built into the 
hamlet's fence, allows travelers to enter the small town.

Well-Traveled Campgrounds on a Giant Hillside~
   This campsite stands just south of Audenshaw, marked by a 
large clearing in the ground, at the center of which is a large, 
stone firepit. A small patch of trees stands near the south east 
of the clearing, and just north of that is a large boulder, which 
overlooks the steep incline to the east. Visible from this 
elevation is Fangorn Forest in all it's glory, and this campsite 
is home to breathtaking sunsets and sunrises. 
   To the west, the pathway to the small hamlet nearby is 
visible.

A Stone Square within the Hamlet~
   The center of this miniscule hamlet is as worn and broken as a 
defeated soldier. Cobblestones cover the ground, eroded by the 
footsteps of countless travelers. A few of the stones have been 
disturbed, jutting out from the ground at awkward angles and 
presenting a hazard to any who cross through the square. From 
the spaces in between the cobblestones, moss and weeds thrive, 
seemingly untended. This overgrowth seems to emanate from the 
crumbling fountain in the center of the square. Despite its 
state, many travelers still frequent this hamlet - small cliques 
bustle through the square, and the presence of caravan wagons and 
horses is quite common. 
   A grimy alley extends in the eastern direction, and an ancient 
door is visible to the west. Southwards one would notice the 
doors to the hamlet, and to the north stands a quaint lake.

These cobblestones are dark-grey in color, though this perhaps is not their natural shade; most of them are coated with every sort of soil and muck imaginable. A good number of these stones have been pried loose from their original setting, presumably by accident. They remain out of place, some of them now dangerous to those in the square.

Worn and Rickety Stables~
   Four sagging, rot-infested walls and a patchwork roof form the 
outer shell of this stable. A few windows, lacking any glass and 
open completely to the elements, adorn the walls. Stalls made of 
a rough and inexpensive wood have been aligned in rows towards 
the northern and southern wall, filled with all varieties of 
horses and mules. The waste of the animals is removed with some 
frequency, but no other signs of cleanliness can be found in 
these stables. Animal hides and cheap canvas have been laid over 
the bare ground near some of the stalls. 
   To the east, a splintering, moss-coated door leads towards the 
hamlet's square.

A Dirty, Narrow Alleyway~
   This alleyway is nothing more than a dirt pathway, set between 
a busy tavern to the north, and the hamlet wall to the south. 
Trash of all sorts covers the alley, including many shards of 
glass. From the trash, a terrible and gut-wrenching stink rises 
- the occasional puddles of vomit along the path serve as 
testament to their strength. The visible portion of the southern 
fence shows much decay, with rot thriving in patches on the 
wooden wall. 
   The alleyway bustles with travelers and caravans, most of who 
seem to be headed either to or from the caravan yard to the east. 
Halfway down the alley, the entrance to a noisy tavern can be 
spotted.

The Caravan Yard of Audenshaw~
   The caravan yard of Audenshaw is an overcrowded, rectangular 
space. It is home to filth and unseemliness, and exudes a 
powerful, sickening smell. A cornucopia of sound mixes and 
mingles in the air, producing a booming noise which can be heard 
for quite a distance. Makeshift tents, horses and wagons are 
visible, some clumped together, and others standing lonely in 
their own portion of the yard. 
   The yard is surrounded on the north, east and south by the 
hamlet walls, and bordered on the west by the town's tavern, as 
well as a small pathway which leads towards the town square.

The Lonely Giant Tavern~
   Numerous patrons are stuffed within this inn - travelers from 
all parts of Gondor, caravan workers, soldiers and outdoorsmen, 
to name a few. An odd assortment of shoddy tables and chairs are 
spread across the creaking, wooden floor. A few cheaply made 
windows are installed in the walls on the east and west of the 
tavern, providing light during the daytime. At night, a small 
armada of lanterns provide a dim visibility, though a good number 
of them have been shattered. The bar itself is affixed to the 
floor near the northern wall, and above it, a painting of a 
massive giant has been hung, encased in an aging frame. 
   To the south, a pair of swinging doors leads towards the dirty 
alleyway outside.

The Docks over a Quaint Lake~
   This small wharf extends northwards away from the center of 
the hamlet, allowing access to a small lake. The waters are a 
dark blue color, and the occasional movements of fish can be 
seen. The dock itself creaks and groans constantly, and some of 
the planks laid across it are broken in, making it navigable only 
by the wary walker. The hamlet fence stops at the lake, leaving 
about two-thirds of the body of water outside of the wooden 
perimeter. 
   To the west, a dirt pathway curves northwards, and the town 
square can be seen to the south.

The sounds of the stable south of the pathway drift through the 
air, carrying with them a faint smell. The town's perimeter is 
visible to the west, rotted and splintering in many places. 
   To the north, the hamlet's graveyard is visible, and to the

to the east. There is along drop on either side down to the 
garden area below yet the bridge is constructed of mallorn wood, 
grey and very strong. No breeze disturbs the air here and silver 
lanterns hang from tree branches to continually bathe the area in 
light. A narrow, arched door has been set into the house on the 
eastern talan to make it more private and in the air the sounds 
of the forest and the distant voices of elves can be heard.

   A relatively cozy house has been built on top of the talan 
here. The floor itself is cut to resemble a large leaf with 
cunning designs etched into it and the house walls rise up to an 
arched ceiling. Curtains of silk hang over the windows and a 
narrow exit to the south leads to a balcony. Lamps continually 
light the area which is one large room, divided with screens for 
some added privacy. Small windows open out to all directions and 
an arched doorway leads to a bridge to the west. The sound of 
elves and birds singing in the distance can be heard.

A Claustrophobic Cave-In through Ruins~
   This narrow tunnel leads from the outside world into a more 
cavernous section of ruins deeper in, to the north. Sharp, 
jagged stone juts out from the walls of the ruins, making this 
path a precarious one. From here, it is evident that a single 
and massive column to the north has somehow managed to keep a 
small section of this tower from complete ruin. The treacherous 
path deeper into the ruins is littered with white guano - proof 
that something still claims this place as its home.

A Ruined, Macabre Greathall~
   What was once a large, round room - part of the even larger 
stone tower - is now a macabre cavern that has survived the rest 
of this ancient place's ruin. Pieces of the grey cobblestone 
floor are broken, uneven and jutting up sparply from the ground 
in places. The once greathall is now barely held up by a massive 
stone column in the center of the cavernous ruin. The walls in 
all directions have collapsed in on themselves, save a narrow 
tunnel leading southward and out of the ruins. A fireplace still 
exists, but half of its frame has fallen off and white guano 
litters its base. 
   The stench of fire-smoke, moldy food, rotting garbage and piss 
lingers here. One chunk of broken wall still shows the symbol of 
a burning hand on the northern cave-in, while another slab of 
stone beside it dictates the upper half of what appears to be a 
clenched fist. The symbols are painted on with something crusted 
and dark-red in hue. The darkness up where the column meets the 
ceiling, which is somehow still intact, is home to many sets of 
small, yellow glowing eyes.

A Small Cave~
   This small cave seems to have been shaped naturally over the 
centuries. The craggy stone walls are glistening as if moist as 
whatever little light coming from the outside hit them. A few 
stalactites are hanging from the uneven ceiling while some 
stalagmites are rising towards the ceiling from the floor. 
Towards the northern wall is a rock about the size of a fist, 
surrounding it are a few dead flowers, some seeming to have been 
there long enough to be nothing but dust while others seem more 
fresh. The floor around the rock seems to have a darker color 
then the rest of the cave.

Another Small Cave~
   This cave is wet and damp, stalactites hanging from the

the size of the cave to the south. Like the small cave to the

Waist-High Swamp within a Submerged Cave~
   The fresh, relatively clean swamp water grows murkier within 
this partially submerged cave. The cave walls are covered in 
mold and the water sits at weight level for the average man. 
Spider webs cover large sections of the tunnel here, and the 
cavern seems to open up more further in to the east. The water, 
too, flows that way - though some of it backs up to push against 
the stale water sitting at the hidden mouth of the cave's 
opening.

The Back of a Swampy, Mostly Submerged Cavern~
   The back of the submerged cavern is covered in thick 
spider-webs and mold. The roof expands more from the western 
tunnel. Most of the water here has backed up at waist-level for 
the average man, and sits here to grow stale. Some water still 
trickles slowly in from the outside, though, and gives an 
otherwise foul smelling place an occasional waft of fresh 
spring-water. The cave dead-ends to the east and some small 
cracks in the worn rockwalls allow for some of the water to 
trickle out of the cave en route towards the river beyond.

Hithlain Rope Bridge Between Two Flets~
   Thin but very strong strands of hithlain rope have been woven 
together to form a bridge between the large hall-talan to the 
east, and a circular, open-air talan to the west. Two support 
ropes are tied securely to the edge of each talan with zigzagging 
strands between them to make passage across easier. Below, the 
garden is visible and all about the sounds of the wood can be 
heard, even the distant voices of Elves singing.

An Airy, Circular Talan High in a Mallorn~
   This simple platform wraps around the trunk of a great 
mallorn, supported by graceful beams of golden wood. The room is 
circular, and rather clean in its lines - there are no large 
pieces of furniture to be seen anywhere within it. The floor has 
been covered with a thin layer of gray cotton, firm and yet not 
so unyielding as wood or stone. The chamber is perfectly 
circular, a waist-high wooden rail surrounding it and protecting 
the unwary visitor from a nasty fall. Huge, arching windows span 
the rail's length, reaching up to the talan's domed ceiling, with 
shutters crafted from woven branches available to protect one 
from the elements. A single doorway leads out of the flet, onto 
a fist-wide span of hithlain rope, which provides the only 
connection between this chamber and a larger talan nearby.

A Rocky Mountain Path~
   Flatter than most of the mountain surrounding, the path eases 
into an easier slant. A boulder lies off to one side, reaching 
the height of an average human's knees, the top flattened, and 
even slightly rounded in some places. Loose pebbles dot the 
small ledge-like pathway, more occasionally trickling down from 
higher above and landing among the others to scatter them along 
the precarious surface. 
   To the south looms the rocky maw of a large cavern.

A Steep Mountain Path~
   Loose pebbles and jutting rocks lead their way up the steep 
mountain, the latter creating small holds to aid in the climb. 
No vegetation finds its way up this direction, leaving within the 
sights a solid expanse of grey below the blue sky. The 
occasional brown stain can be seen splattered against the rock. 
On either side of the steep path, the face of the mountain 
smooths, gliding down to the ground without a blemish.

A Wide Mountain Ledge~
   The pathway draws to a pause at the edge of a ledge, the 
vantage point giving a view over the expanse of the valley 
stretching below. The ground lies coated in treetops, tall and 
smaller stretching their branches widely to allow no full vision 
fully to the floor of the forest. Light bounces off of the 
leaves, leaving them an unusually light shade of green, though 
any peek below would just feature darkness. The trees continue 
on until they touch the horizon in the distance, foliage slowly 
fading into sky.

Within A Narrow Crevice~
   Not deep enough to be called a cave, yet definitely a blemish 
in the side of the mountain face, this narrow crevice has very 
little space. Wider at the bottom than at the top, it gradually 
narrows into a point to merely a crack, before smoothing into the 
sloping surface of the mountain. Nothing juts outward; the 
crevice, instead, sinks inward in an awkward slant - not parallel 
to the ground, but flatter than the face of the rock surrounding 
it. 
   At the far end of this place is a massive stone door wide 
enough for but two men to stand side-by-side before. A strange, 
rune-imbued lock is carved out of the door's right side, and the 
unseen barring mechanism seems to be masterfully built.

A Winding Path Through The Mountains~
   Skimming the edge of the mountain lies a path of worn-down 
vegetation, dried sticks, and the occasional pebble. Tall forest 
trees line one side while the slow and gradual rise of the ground 
leads to mountain on the opposite side - grass, vines, and clover 
slowly giving way to bare, gray rock. Larger branches from the 
forest's edge extend to shadow over the pathway, creating spots 
of shade during the day and more forboding darkness once light 
falls. Occasionally, the thick expanse of a broken branch 
clutters the side of the pathway, stripped of leaves and twigs.

A Small Mountain Valley~
   Sheltered and shadowed below the expanse of the mountain, rock 
slowly begins to give way to dark foliage, greenery, and a 
sprinkling of trees. At first spaced, the trees stretch their 
branches out along each side, shading the ground beneath in 
large, uneven circles. Farther along, however, the trees begin 
to become more numerous, dotting the ground with ancient and 
sapling alike, thickening the darkness gradually as the brush and 
shade increases.

By A Mountain Brook~
   Weaving and turning its way through the rising trunks, a quiet 
brook survives. The water flows over rocks, around trees, and 
through uplifted roots, making its way gently down the slight 
incline of the land. Its existence is secondary to that of the 
looming trees, surrounding, still, with the ever-present absence 
of solid light, branches stretching to cover even the small 
expanse of the brook overhead.

Among Dark Trees~
   Closely set trunks are sticky with moss and sap, gleaming with 
the very occasional beam of light that passes through the expanse 
of the trees. Underfoot, there is little green to be seen, the 
majority of the ground littered with brown, cracked pine needles, 
twigs, and sticks. One tree lies broken halfway up its trunk, 
teetering precariously toward one side, and held upright by the 
tall trees surrounding it. Its branches have fallen barren, and 
its naked expanse seems almost out of place around the otherwise 
green trees.

In A Shadowy Forest~
   Along the forest floor rise saplings of the larger trees, the 
lack of light leaving them dried and bare, reaching to either 
side of their tiny trunks with empty twigs and branches. Above, 
however, foliage stretches, each branch meeting another - 
meeting, entangling, and sprouting leaves enough to leave the 
forest floor devoid of sunlight and moonlight. An occasional 
beam reaches through the thick greenery, but never remains longer 
than a moment before being extinguished by a shift from a breeze.

A Narrowing Ravine~
   Jagged rock rises above a narrowing, natural pathway through 
the surrounding mountains. Limited expanse leaves little room 
for sunlight to reach the ravine floor, darkness flooding all but 
the very top of the rock. Struggling, sparce greenery squeezes 
its way through small crags and cracks in the face of each side, 
climbing weakly toward the top recesses. Along the ground, vines 
creep near to the edge, just before the sharp uprise of the 
cliffs. Small thorns dot along the stem, hidden beneath browning 
leaves.

Within the Tranquil Waters of a Silvan Pond~
   The waters of this silvan pond are not quite deep enough to 
cover the head of a tall being, and here in the quiet glade on 
the edges of Lothlorien, they are peaceful and still. The water 
is also quite clear, like rippling crystal and the mud, rocks and 
reeds along the bottom can be seen easily. The bank is highest 
toward the east where thicker forest rises high and shading that 
side of the pool, while a slope leads westward into the glade 
itself.

The Hole~
   Well-flamed torches affixed to the walls cast smoke-hazed 
amber glows and whipping shadows across this converted cellar, 
the musky scent of spilled ale and dirt hanging thick in the air. 
A crude pit has been dug deep into the ground with walls of 
vertically posted barren logs retaining the sides, a small rope 
ladder set aside at the top as a means to descend within. Dusty 
soil and sand, splotched and spattered with red stains, pads the 
floor of the pit, the occasional foundation stone jutting up and 
through. The cellar's walls are constructed of thick lumber, the 
moisture in the earth surrounding them causing the area to feel 
musty and humid. Smoothed boards are set into the ground below 
as flooring with the occasional splinter piercing upwards amidst 
haphazard stains and nicks. Several rows of raised, roughly hewn 
log benches, pieces of stripping bark still dangling from their 
undersides, are set in a half-circle around the hole opposite the 
cellar stairwell. Racks three layers high are stacked with old, 
mildewed casks, small droplets pooling in stale mixture upon the 
floor. An unpolished, roughly constructed bar counter is set to 
the front of the rack, its surface stained and abused from 
constant use and mistreatment.

cramped and opaque, the candelbras tacked in between the gaps of 
stone doing little to pierce light into the confines of the 
darkness brought upon the room by boards laid over the southern 
window. A loading mechanism set with springs and cranks bears 
the weight of a large wooden bar, set across the doorway to 
prevent entry. Unused lumber and stones litter the corners of 
the room, piled upon otherwise unused areas of the earthen 
flooring which is packed down hard through years of use, uneven 
and slightly pitted in some areas. Set upon and within the 
northern wall is a massive fireplace, its edges covered in a 
sooty film and the remnants of past flames. A red curtain, 
soiled in deep browns and greys from dirt, hangs over an opening 
haphazardly cragged out of the eastern wall.

the freshly exposed dirt than for any purpose of beauty. Tacks

A Burrowed Out Haven~
   Dug out from the hard earth into an area wide about as large 
as the work room above it, this haven is walled on all sides by 
rooted dirt, sturdy log supports framing the walls and ceiling. 
The air within is dense and still, carrying with it the 
occasional waft of nauseating orders that foul the senses. A 
single lantern hangs from the room's center, dangling 
precariously from a length of wire wrapped around one of the 
roof-supporting beams which moan and creak from time to time 
under the constant agony of their load. In the center of the 
room is a small, dug-out area surrounded by runic carvings set 
into the earth amidst smeared stains of black and red.

Sheltered Area Under a Great Mallorn~
   The smooth grey trunk of the mallorn rises up to the west and 
south, preventing any travel that way, while the forest extends 
thickly to the north and east. Soft green moss covers the ground 
underneath the tree in this small area of the glade, while the 
talan above and surrounding branches form ideal shelter. Light 
slants down through the leaves during daylight, and a single 
silver lantern lights the small area by night. The rest of the 
quiet glade opens up to the south.

Entry Hall Caught in a State of Disarray~
   High ceilings arch overhead in magnificent displays of 
improvised masonry, the material supports seemingly salvaged and 
reformed from amongst the ruins and rubble that surround the 
towers exterior. An oddity in architecture and design, a massive 
fireplace is set centrally in the hall, its four sides exposed 
and its chimney supported by four posted supports. A stairwell 
circles up and around the chimney, wooden handrails driven 
solidly within the rock. Beautiful chandeliers are set overhead 
to either side of a brilliant glow, setting even the dimmest 
corners alight in a melodic dance of flame-whicked symphony. The 
floors have been set unsteadily with slabbed rock and granite, 
causing the room to seem to slope slightly to the southwest and 
giving the walls a warped appearance. To the west and east are 
open, arched in similar design to one another while a small 
cellar door is visible off in the northwestern corner, descending 
into the unseen depths below.

A Circled Library~
   Massive shelves of hardened oak line the circular walls of 
this room, a small platform allowing access from off of the 
twisting stairway which continues both to both ascend and descend 
from here along its windy path around the chimney. Though filled 
more with dust and the leavings of uninvited rodents, a few books 
and volumes can be seen within the shelves, set haphazardly and 
without organization within. The floors here are constructed of 
freshly-cut wood, readily supported from beneath while wooden 
columns and cross-set logs help to support the weight of the roof 
above.

Reinforced Battlements~
   Heavy bags filled with dirt are hefted up against the riveted 
stone battlements which encircle this rooftop precipice, pieces 
of wood and windswept leaves caught amongst the gap-stoned edges. 
Set centrally and piercing out from below is the chimney upon 
which the stairs trail, affording passage back below into the 
tower. Whipping high into the air above on the eastern most 
point is a flag-post made of a wooden post supported at the base 
by rubble. The height of this perch offers an unhindered view of 
the nearby surroundings, the tops of trees visible swaying to and 
fro with the machinations of the wind which carries itself so 
well upon this place.

A Kitchen of Chaos~
   Organized chaos in true form, this cleverly organized wind has 
been transformed into a kitchen of sorts. Tools, pots and pans 
of all shapes and sizes dangle from hooks and racks set into the 
walls, dusty splotches of flour and grain wafting in the air and 
cast over the walls and surfaces within. Each of the walls is 
lined with a diverse array of barrels containing various 
ingredients and cooking materials, many of which seem to make 
their way into the massive stove set against the eastern wall.

A Mildewed Dungeon~
   A single, faintly flickering candle illuminates the dank 
interior of this circular room, entered into by way of a small 
staircase descending in from a inwardly-reinforced cellar door 
above. The earthen floor emanates a distinct feeling of 
humidity, casting moisture into the mildew-tainted air, the stale 
scent of mold dominating the senses without mercy. Cast-iron 
shackles are set periodically about the walls, their chains 
grating noisily against the walls with even the slightest 
movement. A small rat hole has been burrowed below the southern 
wall, its leavings evident in various spots upon the ground.

Within a Hidden Dugout~
   Thick wooden posts help to support the earthen walls which 
enclose this cramped space, spindly roots hanging loosely through 
heavy boards laid across the supports and acting as a ceiling. A 
small, single candle's flame writhes within its simple holder 
which has been tacked into the wall with a single rusty nail, 
casting a dim amber glow over the confines and allowing the 
faintest scent of melting wax to mingle in the air. In the 
center of the area and placed directly above the horizontal hatch 
lain into the ceiling above, is a fire-pit encircled by small 
riverstones.

By An Old Tree~
   Moving through the ravine it widens to the north. Set in the 
middle of the widening area is an old, gnarly tree. The roots of 
this very large tree are resting above ground. Rounded wood dips 
and weaves over and beneath the hard-packed soil, creating 
extremely uneven ground. Foliage dwindles on the ground, 
tapering to nearly nothing closer to the large, round trunk. A 
few branches overhead are bare, holding a color more akin to 
grey, than brown. One even has split where the branch meets the 
trunk, the wide bough stretching to the ground, resting at an 
angle against the tree. The ravine narrows to the south or 
continues onwards to the north.

A Deeply-Set Brook~
   Here the ravine has widened enough to let one head east and 
not just north and south. Water has carved out a deep crevice in 
the land here, though with closer inspection, only the trickle 
and gentle movement of a brook rests far down into the available 
space. The top banks are high enough that they are actually dry, 
gradually gaining moisture as they arch down toward the water. 
On either side, lush grass lines the brook, trees dotting the 
land on occasion. The water in the brook is a slightly brownish 
color, picking up much of the soil as it moves along. To the 
east, the distant rush of water echoes through the mountains.

A Tumbling Waterfall~
   A large expanse of rock rises to the East, and on the face is 
a waterfall. Seeming to come directly out of a hole in the stone 
wall, the tiny waterfall makes hardly a sound as it twists and 
turns its way down the rock. Yet, what little sound it makes is 
picked up by the mountain and echoes out over the area. The 
small pool of water at the bottom leading to make a brook that 
travels westward, through a deep crevice around jagged mountain 
stone. In direct contrast to the stone face, greenery coats the 
ground around the small pool, though as the distance from the 
water source grows, it begins to fade into a more brownish hue.

A Wide Ravine~
   The ravine continues, having widened enough to let two dozen 
men walk side by side. The craggy stonewalls rises high above 
any wanderers, looking impossibly steep and not fit for climbing. 
However, to the north the ravine seems to narrow quickly while to 
the south it grows even wider. To the west the ravine opens up 
even further while a few loose dirt mounds sit on the east side. 
Crows seems to have nested in what few craggy trees and bushes 
jutting out from the mountain walls.

Outside A Small Cave~
   A small opening lays in the rock-face of the otherwise 
flawless wall, the inside dark. Around the opening climbs a 
small vine, gripping what little it can of the rock - the leaves 
along the top brown and crisp. A large tree stands to one side 
of the opening, boughs shading the mouth of the cave.

sticks, twigs, and leaves lie in a large, flattened pile, and the 
dirt coating the ground is scratched, clumpy, and uneven. The 
small opening at the front allows little to no weather inside,

The Long Ravine Continues~
   Here, the ravine has narrowed drastically. Dark and damp, 
moisture clings to the crevices of the rising rocks on either 
side of this ravine. Even the clear path through is made 
entirely of wet rocks, creating a slippery and treacherous 
surface. Though no foliage lingers in the area, the dank smell 
of mildew and stagnant moisture lingers in the air. In the 
northern direction, the ravine continues, sharply narrowing in 
the distance.

The Ravine Narrows~
   The ravine tapers gradually to a point, the cliffs rising on 
either side narrowing together until only a sliver of light is 
seen through the cracks above, like a broken ceiling. A few 
notches mark the eastern ravine wall, while the western one 
remains devoid of flaws or crevices. The stagnant, moist smell 
only worsens along the rocky corridor, darkness and shadow cast 
as a result of the high walls on either side. At this point two 
full grown men would be squeezing themselves north or south 
should they decide to walk side by side.

   The ravine has narrowed to such an extent that there is but a 
tiny trickle of light coming from above, as if wandering in a 
cave with cracks in the ceiling. Yet a few scraggly bushes and 
thin tree stretch from the walls and floor, reaching for whatever 
little bit of light they can get. The walls are damp, a strong 
stench of rotten meat wifts in from the north the closer one 
gets. Here, one man could barely walk without scratching the 
walls with his shoulders.

Before a Gate in the Ravine~
   A massive, incredibly thick, iron-reinforced wooden gate bars 
anyone from heading north from this point on. The ravine has 
narrowed to such a point that this must be considered a cave 
rather then being outdoors. This particular spot is wider then 
the ravine to the south, yet still not more then to let four men 
face the gate shoulder to shoulder. Yet a good two dozen could 
likely assemble here, just not side by side while facing the 
structure. The smell of smoke and meat wafts in from the north, 
from beyond the gate, accompanied by chittering and shrieking.

Fortified Nests behind a Gate~
   Nestled in between the steep sides of the mountain, this open 
area is constantly covered in shadow and darkness. Rusty 
weapons, torn armor, pieces of junk and bones litter the area. 
In some cases, the refuse a even forms small nests behind 
boulders or in spiny shrubberies. A large bonfire is blazing, 
day and night, in the middle of the area. Several holes in the 
mountainside creates small, uneven caves, from within the 
chittering sounds of hungry beasts seems to be ever present, as 
they echoes out over the area. On either side of the gate 
leading south, craggy walls seems to offer a chance for someone 
to climb up into the ravine beyond. Yet, it looks as though it 
would be challenging, and possibly dangerous, should one fall.

A hidden Ledge~
   High above the ground down in the ravine, this long ledge 
seems mostly hidden from sight. It is covered by large rocks 
that jut out of the mountainside, giving great protection from 
vision below, and offering a perfect perch to shoot arrows from. 
However the ledge is uneven, and only one with good balance and 
climbing skills would be safe here. Looking down, there appears 
to be a way to climb and jump all the way to the ravine floor, or 
scurry back down to the open area to the east.

Upon Narrow Steps Up the Mountainside~
   Large trees hang desperately onto the rapidly ascending 
mountain slope, exposed roots tangling amidst boulders and earth. 
Some have given up hope, falling helplessly by the wayside in a 
mish-mashing of greenery cast amidst destruction, shattered 
remnants of crushed branches and brush strewn about the area to 
either side of a narrow path laid in crooked steps making its way 
rapidly up the mountainside. The occasional breeze catches upon 
grass which finds itself dwindling away in numbers with each 
passing step of ascension.

A Weather-Worn Path Cut leading through Misty Mountains~
   Jagged rock is set upon either side of stone steps ascending 
in meandering fashion from south to north, steep and perilous 
with surfaces cracked and worn smooth from wind and dust made 
dominant by the passing of time. Thick, brambly brush hangs upon 
the paths edge while dried vegetation seeps through the cracks, 
its life seemingly long since drained leaving only flimsy 
remnants in its stead. Beaten of dirt and rock, a small game 
path meanders off down and away from the main trail.

A Small Ledge Overlooking a Path Below~
   The stone steps ascending from the south gradually narrow into 
a perilous ledge hanging upon the face of a steep cliff 
descending into thick forest pierced by a small game path far 
below. The ledge is marked with an air of instability, its edges 
showing signs of crumbling into chunks of aged rock which have 
taken off the branches of several trees on their unconscious path 
of destruction culminating in randomly grouped pilings. The 
ledge itself winds around the cliff face eastwards, small 
pockmarks in the mountain's rock walls allowing for the 
occasional handhold.

Inside a Wares Stall~
   Basic sanded wooden planks create a framework that holds this 
plain green-canvas and leather covered stand aloft, the tallest 
pitch at just over seven feet high. Wooden stakes and bent posts 
conform the stand into a rounded shape, about twenty feet in 
circumference, the thin walls padded with various furs and skins 
in an attempt to keep out the cool wind often around this caravan 
yard. A simple wooden plank board bolted over a few old barrels 
provides a countertop, other goods stacked into wooden crates or 
hung from the rafters in woolen knitted slings.

   A small trail descends into an intermingling of grass and 
dense brush cast upon either side, its own surface beaten back in 
a mixture of game tracks mashed into each other in a manner both 
haphazard and natural in its appearance. Giving rise back 
towards the steep stone steps above, the small trail also winds 
itself wandering northwards into a dense gathering of thick 
pines. The occasional bird flits overhead, the din of seasonal 
wildlife accompanying in melodies cast upon the wind in sharp 
rises and soothing fades.

   Thick brush is set to either side of a small game trail, 
beaten flat and hard by the passing of time and beast as nipped 
and cracked grass and foliage tells the story of hunger being 
fed. Thick pines loom high overhead, shielding but not 
completely obscuring the view of the mountains looming high 
overhead, their peaks piercing into the skies above. Near the 
base of the mountains a cliff rises high above the tree-tops, its 
pock-marked and jagged surface rising up.

half-crescent acting as a natural balcony overhanging the dense 
woodlands below. Lined with heavy boulders and shattered

the ledge leading in from the west.

below, cracks and jugs of rock bursting forth from within in 
twisting formations of rock cracked by precipitation, wind and 
time. The occasional deeply-drawn root can be seen hanging from 
within haphazard cracks and within holes pocked out of the 
surface. Above the rock face is a small clearing devoid of 
vegetation and filmed over with loose dirt and scattered pebbles, 
a small trail leading westwards while the dark entrance to a cave 
is visible just beyond a small jutting of stone to the north.

the form of large, jagged boulders and violent outcroppings 
tinged in grays and scorched blacks. Below foot, an uneven and 
stony path winds its way through the mountains twisted

offer neither coming nor going as they drift and swirl within 
themselves, long-forgotten formations of rock jutting upwards 
from the floor as they attempt in vain to pierce the lake's 
surface.

On the Northern End of a Massive Subterranean Lake~
   An outcropping of warped rock juts out over the unseen depths 
of the subterranean lake below which lap with menacing tickles 
masked in innocence against the worn stone. Wide and flat, the 
ground beneath has been set in uneven steps jutting up and down 
into a ledge which twists its way along the perimeter of the lake 
northwards.

A Narrow Ledge Twisting Upon the Lake's Edge~
   Hanging precariously over the mostly-still waters of the 
rockbound reservoir below, this ledge winds eastwards in sharp 
turns besought by crumbling, slick rock beneath. The very 
beginnings of a ceiling begin to descend in from above, the 
occasional stalactite jutting into the ledge's path in a natural 
effort to make passage more difficult.

A Snaking Tunnel Winding Away from a Subterranean Lake~
   Low stone walls form on either side of this tunnel as a stone 
ceiling connects from above, winding to and fro in wandering 
fashion betwixt and among randomly cast boulders, rocks and pools 
of condensation indented into the floor beneath. Eastwards a 
crevice shoots through the rocky face, wide enough to allow for 
passage while the tunnel proper continues both north and west.

Before an Ancient and Worn Log Ladder~
   The tunnel winds in from a meandering southerly direction 
before coming to a vertical rock face. Heavy, moisture laden 
logs lay diagonally within a stone escarpment, wedged within by 
unseen forces of the past and nearly rotted and cracked from 
abuses past, both natural, and as evident by several large, hewn 
chunks cast aside, physical in nature. Upwards they ascend in 
stacking order, several large gaps presenting themselves with 
naught more than the stone to either side offering support.

   Wispy strands of silk webbing line the walls of this den, 
obscured behind a crevice piercing outwards into the tunnel 
beyond, leaving in its wake a vicious entanglement of web and 
blood-draught remains of unrecognizable forms, their previous 
nature hinted to only by the bits of fur, bone, and cloth 
scattered amongst the various nooks and crannies of the area. A 
single stalactite juts downwards from the rock ceiling above 
centrally within the den, its point stopping only a few short 
inches from the floor below.

of diagonally emplaced logs stacked within a stone escarpment 
below. Rock rises and swoops overhead into an arching ceiling 
comprised of jagged rock and spindly stalactites, their sharp 
ends jutting downwards from their perch overhead. A shock of air 
cast in from the east carries with it the scent of freshness.

   Sloping overhead in an awkward, triangular formation, barren 
rock arches above, allowing entrance into the depths of a narrow 
tunnel which shoots straight off westwards into a heavily-cast 
darkness. The very faintest tinges of humidity cling to the 
cavern walls, the occasional pool of condensation settling in 
intermittent indents upon the cave floor while slim, 
sharply-ended stalactites hang from above.

   Rock has crumbled into jagged and violent twisting formations, 
allowing for some ease of grip despite its overly dubious nature, 
intermingled with worn and hardy roots alike which descend from 
unseen growth above. Wind whistles against the stone face - 
eerie melodies playing into the din of the surrounding lands 
while the ledge widens into a wider outcropping northwards, at 
the same time allowing descent down to the face beneath.

   Deep cracks and jilting overhangs creep out from the rock upon 
either side of this steeply ascending cliff face, menacing and 
almost violent in nature as they contort in slithering patterns 
formed of time, water and wind. Far below can be seen a small 
clearing framed by trees on all sides, the very tops of which 
seem now to be naught more than pikes awaiting the impalement of 
any who fail to ascend or descend in proper fashion, while 
overhead the rock curves into a lip, allowing passage into the 
unseen land beyond.

the dark mouth of a nearing cave, heavy brush and bramble cast 
upon either side of the too-slick path as it veers towards its 
destination. Footholds seem few and far between, brush and small 
tree-limbs affording only the most minor of relief for passers-by 
in either direction, ascending towards the cave entrance or 
descending down the perilous path.

   A shock of air shoots in from above, blasting against an 
undercurrent tangling from below, both of which act in 
unconscious effort to create a whistling whip of sound and 
movement as they diagonally placed logs continue to ascend from 
below. The stone upon either side of the rapidly ascending 
ladders begins to lose its slickness and regain some semblance of 
grit as it rises, the moisture cast from below starting to thin

the cottage is rather sturdy and has a well-kept appearance, and

In the Misty Mountains~
   This flat ledge on the side of the mountains is high enough to 
be perpetually snow-covered. The mountain offers a little 
protection from the elements, but the ledge itself drops off in 
every direction but the east, where a small path leads down the 
mountain-side. A sparse copse of evergreens struggles to survive 
here, having taken root in the little dirt that has managed to 
accumulate, their roots spreading deep into the stone of the 
mountain, causing cracks to radiate outward . The eastern trail 
is narrow and winding, with many switch-backs as it makes its way 
downward. Someone has placed logs, crudely hewn in half 
lengthwise, at intervals along the path to provide footing for an 
easier hike.

untempered by cooking fires still give off a pine scent. The 
clay and rock chimney of the hearth below extends here through 
the room and towards the roof, providing warmth in the cold. A 
simple green paint has covered the floorboards, flaking in a few 
spots but otherwise untemperet aside from several childish 
drawings in charcoal against the wall near the chimney.

A Simple, Fur-Floored Bedroom~
   Simple sanded wooden planks covered in a pine-scented stain 
create this bedroom, that leads open-doored back into the kitchen 
area, to take advantage of the heat coming from the hearth. A 
large, thick bear-skinned rug comprises most of the floor, adding 
a soft walk underneath the foot and a ward against chill. Basic 
furniture, some of it of obviously homemade makes up the rest of 
the room. Relatively spacious for a cabin of this size, this 
bedroom could hold several people comfortably.

A Shell of a Fortress~
   Scattered debris of burnt wood litter the hard ground, here on 
the shores of the river crossing. A stone wall lies toppled 
over, the many stones are tossed around the area. The burnt 
remains of walls and gates both to the south and the north can be 
seen poking up from the ground. Clearly someone has gone loose 
on the area with fire and shovel, leaving nothing but charred and 
broken remains of the building that once stood here. k

Atop a Tall Stone Wall~
   Standing atop the wall, the view is impressive in both 
directions. At the peak of the ridgeline, an unobstructed view 
extends southwards over the treetops below, the tall walls and 
towers of a settlement seen clearly not far beyond. Northwards 
lies heathlands, a deep ravine cutting across it like a jagged 
scar not far north, a mountain trail rising up the mountainside 
to the west. Wooden catwalks run along near the top of this tall 
stone wall, attached to a sturdy system of wooden bracings that 
line the back of the wall and spread into the courtyard below. 
Stone crenellations offer cover to those on duty here, as high as 
a man with deep cuts to allow archers to see clearly to those on 
the ground beyond the wall. A winch system extends up and out 
over the courtyard, raising and lowering the platform that gives 
access to these catwalks from twenty feet below.

A Makeshift Camp Guarded By Marchwardens~
   There is little activity here most days among the cleared-out 
dirtyard surrounded by the hamlet walls. A row of small tents 
are nestled against the eastern fortifications and large piles of 
crates and bins awaiting transport are carefully piled and 
labelled within a small gated fenced enclosure. The Marchwardens 
of Great Lord Berenos allow none but official visitors and supply 
drops into the main section of this place.

A Small Stone-walled Courtyard~
   Hard-packed earth is flanked by tall reinforced walls of 
mortared stone on all sides, shadows long and deep at all hours 
except mid-day. To the west stands a tall watchtower, square 
stone walls rising high above the mountain ridge, the slopes of 
the mountain seen rising a short distance beyond. To the east a 
door leads into a squat gatehouse, the sounds of creaking winches 
and clanking chains heard from within. A massive wall of 
mortared stone reinforced by fire-hardened timbers rises to the 
north, catwalks visible along its top. To the south is a 
shorter, simpler wall without catwalks or the networked timbers. 
A simple wooden paddock is built between a pair of timbers along 
the northern wall, a few animals within.

Inside a Gatehouse~
   Reinforced walls of thick, mortared stone enclose this 
chamber, which is perpetually dim. Dark beams of fire-hardened 
timber band the interior of the walls, arcing up as a series of 
interlacing triangles at regular intervals to connect in the 
center of the chamber. The center of the chamber rises to three 
times as tall as a man, allowing a mounted host to ride through 
unhindered by the crossbeams, while at the edges of the chambers 
a tall man needs to duck his head. Dark planking forms a floor 
above, the sound of dragging chains and cranking winches heard 
against the wood as the massive gates of thick timber and iron 
banding to the north and the iron portcullis to the south are 
opened and closed. Torch sconces are embedded in the stone, 
allowing some light to those that stand watch.

A Wide, Spartan Dormitory~
   This wide room composes the entire upper floor of the tower, 
thick walls of mortared stone buttressed by darkened timbers on 
every side. Sanded planks of hardwood make up the flooring 
between this level and the main room below, warm to the feet, 
while braced and fitted stone composes the roof above, a pleasing 
a seamless whole that blends with the criss-crossing network of 
timbers that fills the upper part of the chamber. A large 
fireplace attaches to a chimney that rises up the north wall to 
provide warmth in the cold winter nights, while ladders extend 
both up and down through trapdoors near the south wall. A 
massive cast-iron cauldron fills the northeast corner of the 
room, stretching through the beams that support and pin it to the 
ceiling above, iron fittings connecting it to the wall itself, 
providing the ability to #6raise#0 cauldrons of boiling #6oil.#0

Atop a Stone Tower~
   Standing high above the heathland below, this rooftop has an 
unobstructed view in all directions. To the west rises the steep 
slope of the mountains not far off, the white caps visible only 
on cloudless days. To the south is a rocky ridge line, declining 
sharply to a shadowed woodland below, high walls and two towers 
seen beyond the trees marking the presence of a town. Below to 
the east lies the courtyard of the tower, buttressing timbers 
there supporting a massive siege wall to the north, and just 
beyond the courtyard a squat gatehouse of matching mortared 
stone, the clanking of winches and chains carrying on the wind. 
To the north stretches wild heathland and a winding road that 
clings to the mountainside above the cleft of a jagged ravine, 
cutting an arc in the earth and filled with dark shadows. Far in 
the distance is the occasional glint of a river, cutting across 
the land. Fitted stone makes a solid and sturdy flooring here, 
capable of bearing the weight of the equipment that resides along 
the edge of the roof at its northeast corner. A station for a 
heavy, iron cauldron, dragged from below with chains and 
machinery, and a spout to #6pour#0 boiling #6oil#0, is set with a 
series of wooden plungers and levers arrayed together with 
hinges, a feat of engineering not easily comprehensible.

A Steep, Rocky Slope~
   Loose shale and dirt shifts underfoot, unfettered by any 
grasses or roots excepting the occasional stunted and withered 
evergreen shrub. The mountain continues upward at a precipitous 
angle to the west, levelling out at a shallower angle here, then 
coming to an abrupt stop below to the east against hard walls of 
mortared stone that top the ridge line, abutting against the 
sheer mountain face.

   A bare ridge of stone rises from the earth like an exposed 
spine, large, loose rocks like spines rising along its length. 
The wind whips fiercely across the unprotected escarpment, coming 
down off the high mountain slopes that rise sharply to the west. 
To the south is a sharp decline, a narrow animal path through the 
crumbling rocks leading towards the forests stretching out below. 
The rise humps upward to the east, the mortared stone walls of a 
fortification built against it to the northeast just beyond.

or used as a waystation before. A narrow game trail winds up the 
sharp incline above towards the ridgeline's top, crumbling rocks 
making it look unstable. To the west a deer trail leads down the 
bank of a water-carved gully.

A Dried-out Gully~
   A rock escarpment rises up and east, worn smooth by the 
passage of water running off the ridgeline above as it carves 
this narrow, muddy gully between the hills. A gentle bank 
criss-crossed by game trails slopes up to the north to a cliff 
face not far off. The bottom of the gully is parched and cracked 
earth, thirsty for the next rainfall. The gully continues off 
between the hills to the west, winding around boulders and 
obstacles at the feet of the mountain. A crumbling bank pocked 
with the thirsty, seeking, white roots rises steeply to the 
south, a patch of evergreen trees stretching into the air a short 
climb above.

   This man-made grove has obviously seen better days, many of 
the former trees twisted and uncared for, bearing no fruit and 
being helpful for little but firewood. Mountain birds and 
squirrels still scatter amidst the ruined branches, their calls 
and cries echoing into the cool air. Rough hewn logs outline the 
boundaries of this orchard, keeping people and trees alike from 
tumbling down the cliffside to the village below. Scraggly 
shrubs and trees that may once have been flowers or herbs lie 
overgrown and chaotic amidst the tall grass.

   The inside of this small tent is close and cramped, leaving 
room for a very limited number of people or property. Men at 
full height would have difficulty standing at full height besides 
at the very center where this A-frame tent is tallest. A mixture 
of cloth and leather strips sewn together with sinew thread keeps 
the brown-dyed tent waterproofed yet breathable, and flexible 
enough to handle wind. Underfoot, a bear skin rug provides 
protection against the cold ground - but a full small stones or

In Front of a Small, Cozy-Looking Log House~
   A small field of grass and clover lines a path over the 
fertile soil here. The cobblestone path leads up to the doorstep 
of a small, sturdy-looking log house, nestled in a small clearing 
at the far end of the clump of trees. Carved on the simple, 
solid oak front door is the image of a tall, strong cedar tree, 
stained a darker color than the reddish-brown door. The door's 
hinges and fittings are functional, and appear to be of high 
quality despite their lack of ornamentation. The doorframe and 
window frame are stained the same reddish-brown hue. The roof 
looks well-maintained; the whole house has a functional feel. 

To the east, the path leads back to the #2group of cottages#0 
gathered around the brook. While in all other directions, thick 
uncut woods encroach on the pathway and house.

A Small Living Area and Kitchen~
   This moderately-sized room has the feeling of a cozy hunting 
lodge, and it appears to double as both kitchen and living space. 
Aside from the window that looks out to the east, toward the 
woods in front, the walls are covered in pelts and furs this 
gives a feeling of warmth to the whole place. The floor is of 
dark-stained hardwood, and is covered in places with a few fur 
rugs. A stone fireplace and chimney are set in one wall, next to 
which lies a modest wood stove. The room occasionally smells 
faintly of the aroma of apple-wood smoke. A simple, 
solid-looking, moss-green-painted door with a good-quality knob 
and hinges is set in the northern wall.

A Cozy Bedroom~
   This small room lies at the northern end of the log house. 
Like the larger room through the green-painted southern door, 
this room's sturdy walls are mostly covered with furs. A small 
table with a lamp sits near the door, and a window looks out 
toward the front of the house. This appears to be a room for 
sleeping, and is appointed accordingly the same warm, comfortable 
feeling that pervades the rest of the house is present here. In 
one corner of the wooden floor lies a thick fur rug.

rug~
   Lying in the corner, this rug is thick and large. When lying 
flat this rug is thick and dirty brown. The edges are roughtly 
cut but is good enough shape as to resemble a large animal, 
possibly a bear. If one were to look closely three small bulges 
in a large triangle layout could be discerned.

Inside a Pine-Scented Cart~
   The inside of this wooden cart has the distinctive astringent 
scent of pine, the bottom lain with various furs to provide some 
cushioning for passengers or cargo on bumpy travels. The snorts 
and noises of the horse pulling the wagon and the sounds of the 
areas the cart passes through filter through the thick cloth and 
leather tent that provides the cart's shelter.

Inside a Red-and-White Cart~
   The inside of this cart is decidedly simple, providing room 
for sleeping, but little in the way of room for many upright 
passagers or trade transport. Some simple shelves have been 
bolted to wall, and a well-abused striped feather mattress 
occupies one corner. A weathered canvas tarp ceiling provides 
protection against the elements and privacy for those within.

In A Copse of Trees Away from the Caravan Route~
   The scent of moss mixed with decaying leaves and crisp pine 
assaults the senses in this copse of aged trees. Massively 
trunked firs arch their firm boughs high into the skies, muting 
any light in this expanse of trees. Moss and needles from the 
trees creep across the ground like a thick carpet, encroaching 
and occasionally enveloping small stones that pepper between 
strong, gnarled roots which, meandering from their individual 
trees, taper into the moss.
