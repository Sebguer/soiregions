#4The Harnen River flows briskly on its long journey to the sea.#8~
   The Harnen briskly flows downstream. The river is wide and 
swift. It meanders along from its long journey from the eastern 
mountains to the sea in the far west. The water is cool and 
pleasant to the touch. There are always water fowl out on the 
water, and occasionally, fish can be seen flopping up and down. 
Heavy foilage on each bank comes down directly to the water's 
edge.

   A narrow stream of clean, transparent, cool water babbles over 
rocks worn by its passage over time. The brook is a thriving

mosses and grasses surrounding the quieter parts of the stream, 
and by the small fish and insects visible wherever there is an 
accumulation of still water.

is made of burnished bronze wrapped in leather cording to allow 
for a more secure grip and this weapon is obviously quite a 
danger in the hands of a skilled person.

   This wooden dock juts out from the muddy shores here and into

the horizontal boards, which you would walk on, at odd angles or 
not there all together. Waves lap against the side of the dock, 
making the timber glisten with water. It is wide enough for four 
people to walk abreast, but any more than that would be dubious.

a sandstone sarcophagus~
A sandstone sarcophagus rests here, carved arms crossed.~
   Carved into the shape of a resting man, arms crossed over his 
chest, this sarcophagus has been worked out of sandstone, the 
sallow stone showing its age. The lid of the sarcophagus seems 
to have been moved recently, resting ajar on the base, small 
pieces of debris crumbling into the hollow below.

a striped goat-hair desert tent~
A goat-haired desert tent with wide red stripes is pitched here.~
   With walls of finely woven goat-hair dyed in strips of white 
and black, this three ridged tent provides space and shelter from 
wind, sand or even occasional rain. Poles of thin wood provide 
structure and seperate the tent into what appears to be three 
different possible sections, while several woven ropes and pegs 
keep the structure firmly rooted. Small ties along several of 
poles suggest that many, if not all of the walls of the tent can 
be rolled up out of place while keeping the roof intact.

An old and ragged stuffed rhinocerous~
   Showing obvious signs of a long and difficult life, this 
stuffed Rhinocerous is nearly more patches and stitches than 
original flesh. At one point in its early life, it appears to 
have been intended as a replication of a oversized rhinocerous, 
one with a fat belly, short legs and large single horn adorning 
its snout, though these days the horn is chipped, the skin is 
patched, and one leg is nearly absent of its stuffing.

A sturdy riverboat with an owl figurehead is moored here.~
   Securely moored here, this craft is small, no longer than 
forty or fifty feet in length. The stern is bow with an ornate 
owl figurehead whereas the rest of the craft remains unadorned. 
Though not new, this craft is in good condition. The wood that 
make up the hull and deck is sturdy-looking though stained from 
life in the water. A house-like structure is built on the aft 
side of this craft with several windows facing out to the port. 
Resting high on the water, most of the craft is above the 
waterline.

A desert-camouflaged cuirboulli vest is here.~
   This chest piece covers most of the upper torso, and is made 
of high quality water-hardened leather. On either side a hole is 
cut out for the arms to slip through, buckles attached to the 
vest to allow sleeves to be affixed. Throughout the entirety of 
this sturdy piece of leather are unpatterned mixtures of light 
brown, tan, and cream colors. The blending of the colors, 
however unconventional, seem to be placed quite purposefully.

leggings are unpatterned, yet seemingly purposeful designs of the 
same tan, brown, and cream colors.

A pair of desert-camouflaged archer gloves are here.~

inside of the forearm with a single piece of dried sinew and are 
missing the index and middle fingers.

A spiked buckler is here, camouflaged with shades of the desert.~
   This buckler is about two feet in diameter, and oval in 
appearance. It's slightly bowled out, allowing room for the arm 
to fasten comfortably to the backside via leather straps, and a 
metal hand-grip is forged inbetween. The other side is 
unadorned, save random yet seemingly purposeful shades of tan, 
brown, and cream colors which provide a form of camouflage best 
used in the desert. In the center of the shield is a spike, 
which has been painted with the same colors.
