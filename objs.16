fountain contaminated OTHER firefighting~
a contaminated fountain~
A small, contaminated fountain stands here, bubbling oily water.~
  Once clear, cool water trickled out of a stone carved fish's mouth, 
collecting in a shallow pool around the fountain's base. Now, either
as effect of sorcery to the underground source, treason or simple 
effect of siege engines, the water seeps oily, tepid and contaminated,
completly unwholesome for consumption. Although still useable for
washing, if the smell is bearable, or quenching fires, this fountain is
no longer helpful to quench the thirst of any but the foulest of ork.

an animal or douse a small fire.

Banhammer baleful fear death aura hawkes METAL~
The Baleful Banhammer~
The banhammer lies here, an aura of fear and death about it!~
   The hammer is of a mighty size, forged of only the strongest 
metals known to man, and several currently unknown, it radiates 
an aura of death, fear and dispair in all that dare break any of 
the rules of the hallow gamed, Shadows of Isildur. With a shaft 
several feet long and a head composed of what many suspect is 
pure and raw 'pwn', this weapon is truely fit for a god.

Winstick stick win epic awesome hawkes WOOD~
the win-stick of epic~
The epic win-stick lies here, basking you all in a warm and happy glow.~
   At first glance this innocent stick appears nothing more than 
an actual stick, though on closer inspection it is clear to all 
that this very stick is the mythical stick of WIN, the rare and 
treasured stick that all crave. Only a few inches long with a 
pointy end this simple twig can only be used by the chosen one of 
the cult of win, for should another take up the legendary 
win-stick, he would surely be smote in to a pile of dirty fail.

gas-mask gas mask tough rubber OTHER~
a rough, black gasmask~
A black gasmask has been left here, made of tough rubber.~
   This mask has been fashioned out of an unknown, pale 
bone-white substance. Although quite rigid when held in the 
hand, it moulds itself perfectly to the wearer's face and moves 
with each facial expression. It is fashioned in the likeness of 
a grinning skull, with dark, hollow eyes and mouth, though no 
features of the wearer can be seen through it. Only a true 
Master of the Sith Order would wear this."

A wide rigged holster lies in a heap here.~
   This device, made of some unknown metal from a galaxy far, far 
away, is made to clip onto the user's belt and hold their 
lightsaber. It is easy to use and one would be able to get their 
lightsaber easily from this holder.

a heavy, dull-grey bolt pistol~
A large pistol has been laid here, finished in dull grey~
This gun is long and slender, its shape mostly resembling a
slightly flattened cone, its surface a shiny, smooth chrome.
It has a comfortable handgrip and trigger on its underside, and
a laser scope is mounted on top of it. It has a second grip
further up the barrel and an extendable bracket to butt up
against the shoulder of the one wielding it. Painted on the
side is the symbol of a jagged lightning bolt, above which is
the cartridge into which its ammunition is loaded for firing.
