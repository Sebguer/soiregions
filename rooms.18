Within An Enormous Cesspool~
   This large, round stone chamber appears to be an enormous 
cesspool, fed by the river of sewage flowing in from the east. 
The surface of the putrid liquid is covered in sludge and other 
floating debris. Several half-submerged grates along the walls 
mark the presence of outflow pipes, their metal bars set close 
together, preventing most of the solid waste from flowing out.

A Sewage Outflow Chamber~
   This large, nearly-circular chamber is built of huge stone 
blocks and smells of human waste and other rotten things. The 
majority of the floor is taken up by an enormous pool of putrid 
brown water, its surface covered in sludge. There is a narrow 
walkway around the perimeter, and bridges crossing the gaps 
created by the three tunnels that branch off from this room. 
Only the western passage appears to lack solid footing; it 
provides an egress for all the sewage flowing in from the other 
two, though the amount coming in from the southern tunnel is much 
greater than from the eastern one. Dark stains on all the nearby 
surfaces indicate that, at times, there may have been flooding.

All the sewage appears to be flowing into a larger chamber to
the west. The stone walkways do not continue in that direction,
ending at the small bridge that spans the opening in the wall.

A Sewage Inflow Tunnel~
   An enormous pipe, covered by an imposing metal grate, is set 
into the ceiling at the southern end of this tunnel. It spews 
forth a seemingly unending river of sewage, the putrid liquid 
flowing northward, where this wide passage connects to an even 
larger chamber. Above the foul water, there are two narrow stone 
walkways attached to either wall, providing a solid, if rather 
slippery, surface to tread upon.

A Sewage Tunnel Slanting Upward~
   The walls and floor of this tunnel are slick with moisture, 
and the air is damp and cold. Two walkways, one on either side 
of the passage, provide a path above the river of sewage that 
flows through here. The surface of the liquid is covered in a 
thick layer of brown sludge and other floating debris. The 
occasional rotten bit of wood or dead rat are visible, and the 
smell that rises from the muck is strong and putrid. The tunnel 
has grown rather steep as it slants upward to the south, making 
it even harder to keep one's footing on the narrow walkways.

A Damp Intake Tunnel~
   This dank room reeks of human filth, positioned as it is at 
the veritable headwater of a river of waste. Just to the north, 
a massive grating allows cold water and human waste to flow into 
a deep channel, which flows turgidly off around a bend. The 
ground here is made of solid limestone blocks, and is constantly 
damp, moisture hanging in the stale air and coating everything in 
a thin sheen of mist. An archway leads off to the east, into 
what looks like some sort of storage facility.

A Forgotten Storage Area~
   This small storage facility is cut from square blocks of 
limestone, its walls lined with empty and half-rotting crates. 
The air here is stale, and reeks of something foul whenever a 
cold gust blows in from the west. A wrought-iron grate cut into 
the northwestern corner of the room provides dim light during the 
daytime, and perhaps a glimpse of the moon at night. It's 
obvious that whatever purpose this facility was used for 
originally, it is now nothing more than one of the forgotten 
places in the vast sewers of Minas Tirith. Footprints in the 
layers of dirt which lie atop the limestone flooring hints that 
someone, at least, remembers that it is here.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   A slowly flowing river of dark brownish-green water runs down 
the center of this tunnel, its surface covered in a thick layer 
of sludge. To either side, attached to the grimy gray walls, are 
two narrow walkways; they provide a solid surface upon which to 
tread, though the space between them is not very large. The 
stones from which this passage is crafted are worn from age and 
the constant moisture of this place, but they still appear to be 
strong, with only a few cracks here and there. From the low 
ceiling, the occasional cobweb is visible, though all they seem 
to catch is dust.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   This tunnel is roughly rectangular in shape, with two narrow 
walkways, each attached to one side of the passage. Between them 
is a slowly flowing river of dark brownish water, the putrid 
liquid reeking of rotting material and other worse things. The 
gray and black stones that form the walls and ceiling are covered 
in and grime, making their original color impossible to tell.

   The tunnel here widens considerably, with a dryer tunnel 
branching off of it to the east. The river of sewage flows north 
to south, getting narrower as it goes. Where the passage 
branches off, a walkway on either wall converge to form a sort of 
bridge above the putrid liquid, supported from below by brick 
arches. It provides a way across to the walkways in the tunnels 
heading west.

   The stench of this place is rivalled only by the cold and the

low arched ceiling, making standing upright difficult for all but 
the shortest of people. The ground slants downward here, going 
perhaps to some lower level of the sewer. In the opposite 
direction the passage connects to a somewhat larger tunnel, from 
which the sound of running water is clearly audiable.

visible source for the liquid that coats the surfaces of this 
passage, but flowing water is clearly audiable, and is likely 
somewhere nearby.

A Damp Corner Of The Sewers~
   This damp corner of the sewers smells of refuse and other 
rotten things. The air is cold and somewhat humid, though the 
moisture on the walls has little effect on the layers of grime 
covering the gray-black stones. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling, 
their strands clumped together, catching only dust. The floor is 
slick with some slimy, unidentifiable substance, making it 
somewhat tricky to tread upon.

A Slimy Dead End~
   This dank corner of the sewers is damp and musty, the floor 
slick with what might be water, or perhaps something else less 
benign. The gray stones of the walls are covered in some sort of 
thick slime, slowly oozing from the crevices, as if something 
behind the wall were leaking through. The dead end is otherwise 
unremarkable, the air cold and thick with the smell of rotting 
things.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   This tunnel is somewhat cramped, the gap between the two stone 
walkways attached to either wall might even be narrow enough for 
someone to hop across, though the slick surfaces could make it 
rather tricky. Flowing slowly down the center of the passage is 
a river of sewage, its surface covered in a thick layer of 
sludge. The air here is cold and reeks of waste and rot, and the 
slightly arched ceiling is coated in grime and old dusty cobwebs.

   This narrow tunnel is cold and cramped, and the air is thick 
with the smell of waste and other rotten things. Two walkways 
are attached to each side of the passage, providing a path above 
the river of putrid brown liquid that flows through here. A 
large pipe protrudes from one wall, gushing water that splashes 
down to join the sewage, sending bits of sludge flying in all 
directions.

An Irregularly-Shaped Sewage Tunnel~
   The walls of this tunnel seem angled strangely, as if built 
around something; the ceiling has an odd shape, curved on one 
side and flat on the other, creating a somewhat irregular bulge. 
The passage itself widens here, the two walkways attached to 
either wall coming together at the farthest point to form a 
bridge above the slowly flowing river of sewage that takes up the 
center of the passage. The foul smell that hangs in the cold air 
seems to be rising from the thick liquid, though it is much worse 
the closer one is to the floor.

the center of this passage. The surface of the liquid is covered

A Bend in the Tunnels~
   The stones of this tunnel are slick with moisture, the grime 
so thick that the dampness has little effect on the gray-black 
walls and floor. From the ceiling hang thin streamers of 
spider's web, their strands catching only dust. A river of 
brownish liquid flows down the center making the bend of the 
floor, going west to south, and narrow walkways are attached to 
the walls above it, providing solid footing in those directions. 
Thick metal rungs set onto the stones provide access to a large 
circular opening in the ceiling. 
   There is an iron grate above leading to the street.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   Attached to each wall of this tunnel is a narrow stone 
walkway, built well above the river of thick brownish water 
flowing slowly down the center of the passage. However, dark 
stains cover the floor, suggesting that the putrid liquid has, at 
times, overflowed and flooded this area. The entire place smells 
of refuse and rot, and of much fouler things besides. The air is 
cold, and the cobwebs that hang from the ceiling are coated in 
dust and grime.

A Sewage Tunnel~
   This damp, musty tunnel is roughly rectangular in shape and 
has been crafted from large stone blocks. Whatever color they 
may have originally been, the walls and ceiling are now too 
coated in dirt and grime to tell, giving them varying hues of 
gray. Down the center of the passage runs a slowly flowing river 
of brownish water, its surface covered in sludge. Two raised 
stone walkways are attached to each wall, though they are not 
nearly high enough to avoid the stench rising from the putrid 
liquid. To the south is a large grating, that appears to be very 
firmly entrenched in the surrounding stone. Despite the 
appearance of rust, the grating looks quite solid.

   This half-submerged passage appears to branch off from a much 
larger one, the opposite end disappearing around a corner. The 
ground is completely hidden beneath the putrid brownish water and 
a thick layer of foul-smelling sludge, making it impossible to 
see the floor. The stench that rises from the muck is made worse 
by the damp and the cold; it clings to everything and gives the 
air a bitter taste. Several pipes set into the ceiling spew 
forth a constant stream of liquid, most of which gushes out of 
the chamber through another, much larger pipe to the south.

A Half-Submerged Sewage Inflow Tunnel~
   This long, wide tunnel is half submerged in sewage, the putrid 
liquid gushing in from several pipes near the ceiling. At the 
far western end are metal rungs set into the wall, leading up to 
what might be a another passage. However, there is a sturdy iron 
grate covering the opening far above. Much of the foul water is 
flowing around a bend to the east, though a great deal of sludge 
has accumulated on the surface, probably due to how slowly it 
seems to be moving. 
   There is an iron grate above leading to the street.

A Small, Neatly-Organized Storage Room~
   Deep in the sewers as it is, this room is surprisingly 
well-kept, its walls and floors cut from limestone, cold to the 
touch and slightly damp. The air here is stale, and whiffs of 
human waste can be detected any time a cold breeze - surprisingly 
frequent underground - blows in from the north. A few crates are 
stacked against the southern wall, and shelves mark the western 
and eastern walls. An empty bracket hangs, where a lantern or 
torch might be situated, by the narrow arch that opens back out 
into the rest of the sewers to the north.

Northwest Corner of an Ancient Vault~
   One can hardly help feeling small under the expansive 
limestone ceiling looming high above, held up by elegant, 
sweeping supports that curve up from the wall. There is usually 
some traffic in this corner of the vault as furtive, well-dressed 
figures appear periodically from the iron door at the west, 
admitted by a surly-looking coterie of thugs who can be found to 
mill about here at all times of the day and night. To the east, 
the wide vault entrance gapes, while bickering and cat calls 
drift in from the south.

At a Pair of Caved-In Doors~
   Here lies the original entrance of a spacious, ancient 
limestone vault, its heavy iron doors collapsed from their hinges 
and lying sprawled across the wide doorway to the north. This 
broad chamber was clearly cut from the earth hundreds of years 
ago, during the height of Gondor's stoneworking genius, and the 
fat limestone blocks are so perfectly aligned that they seem 
little more than hewn texture on the face of a single, enormous 
swath of stone. The vault is filled with the raucous murmur of 
civilization, much as might have been intended for times of 
siege, but the thugs, smugglers and charlatans who occasionally 
pass could hardly be the intended inhabitants. East and west lie 
the northern corners of the vault, while some way to the south 
can be glimpsed a dense crowd gathered at the center.

Northeast Corner of an Ancient Vault~
   This corner of the vault seems to have been converted into a 
kind of open dining hall. Sweaty, unpleasant cooks occasionally 
scuttle in from the south with cauldrons of bubbling stew and 
stacks of brown bread to serve those who wander over from the 
market to the southwest. The more adventuresome of the rats who 
have made their way into the vault from the sewer beyond also 
seem to congregate here, some of them quite bold in their 
attempts to pilfer food. To the south, the entrance to a 
flophouse can be seen and west lies the toothless maw of the 
ancient vault.

Among Makeshift Stalls in an Ancient Vault~
   Here along the western wall of the vault, a number of 
shambling, filthy sewer-dwellers have erected market stalls made 
of refuse, stonework debris and rotting crates. Few others pass 
this way save the leather clad thugs who patrol the area, and 
even they seem loathe to linger. Those who do approach these 
stalls seem as much inclined to harass their owners as to make a 
purchase. From the east rises the human cacophony of the market 
center, punctuated by the occasional squawk of a rooster or whine 
of a dog. To the south, more wretches in putrid rags mill about.

The Gentlemen's Emporium~
   The center of this ancient limestone vault is encircled by a 
variety of stalls and small bartering tents, some of which are 
elaborately decorated. The scene is rendered somewhat bizarre by 
its essential similarity to those one might encounter above and, 
indeed, few of the merchants, stallkeeps and buyers look quite at 
home so far underground. Crescent-eyed toughs clad in dusty 
leathers roam through the excitable crowd, occasionally 
apprehending a pickpocket or petty thief and dragging him away. 
The dense babble of deals being made and limbs being broken 
echoes off the distant limestone ceiling and little is said here 
that is not heard by everyone who cares to listen. To the north, 
the vault entrance gapes wide, and a relatively steady stream of 
merchants and thugs passes eastward toward a flophouse.

Before a Flophouse Carved From the Earth~
   The elegant limestone blocks of the eastern wall of the vault 
have been crudely hacked away, leaving a jagged hole in the stone 
that has since been fitted with a pair of rough saloon doors. 
Beyond the doors lies a cozy, hand-dug cavern twinkling with 
candles and smelling of beer and urine. When the market is open, 
there is a nearly constant flow of smugglers, criminals and 
merchants between the flophouse to the east and the Emporium to 
the west, and at most times a few secretive, unfriendly men and 
woman linger here. Southward, the corner of the vault is awash 
in flickering torchlight.

A Vagabond Camp Nestled in a Dark Corner~
   Nowhere in the ancient vault is the air thicker with the 
stench of human waste and suffering. The tramps who have set up 
a temporary camp in this dark corner are dirty and destitute 
almost beyond imagining. Silence hangs over them like a death 
shroud and many flee outright into the darkness rather than 
suffer the attention of outsiders who attempt to interact with 
them. Bright torchlight from some way to the east lashes over 
the walls, cradling the area in jagged, menacing shadow.

Southern Face of an Ancient Vault~
   The limestone floor has been cleared of debris here to make 
way for a crude wooden pen which has been bolted to the stone 
blocks beneath it. A thin layer of straw strewn across the floor 
of the pen is splattered with drops of dark crimson, and a number 
of burly toughs with unsympathetic faces keep a listless watch 
over the area. High above, swooping stone arches support the 
breathtaking expanse of the ancient stone ceiling while on the 
ground rats skitter over foot and dark shadows waver just at the 
edge of sight. Lively, excited chattering wafts in from the 
market center to the north.

An Iron Door in the Corner of an Ancient Vault~
   A forbidding iron door, nearly tall enough for two men to pass 
on top of one another, looms to the south, fitted with exquisite 
precision into the limestone wall. A rectangular indentation at 
eye-level suggests the presence of a shutter. At either side of 
the door, great, blazing torches stand, fitted into heavy, 
wrought iron torch holders. Several paces out from the door, 
nestled in the southeast corner of the vault, a crudely chiseled 
hole in the limestone floor has been sealed with a jagged, rusty 
iron grate which is a bit too large for the opening. To the 
north the entrance to a flophouse can be seen, while the noise 
from the market drifts in from somewhere to the northwest.

   Ancient limestone blocks slump under their own weight along 
the walls of this dark tunnel which echoes with the cacophonous 
roar of flowing sewage from the east. Cracks and fissures invade 
the otherwise sturdy structure of the passage rather insidiously, 
and in one particularly weak spot the bricks have simply fallen 
away from the earthen perimeter in a sad heap. From inside the 
pile of rubble, beady eyes reflect the scant light as they peer 
out furtively.

A Dead End Packed With Rubble~
   Perhaps this ancient corridor once led to a guardhouse or a 
storage alcove when cityworkers frequented this wing of the 
sewers beneath the White City, but a cave-in has dramatically 
sealed off the western passage. The limestone floors are 
littered with dust and debris, and the elegant stonework is 
marred by abrasions and pressure fractures. Rushing water echoes 
from the east and south, the sound dampened by thick stone walls. 
The tunnel is just wide enough for two men to walk side by side 
as it stretches eastward into the dark, a handful of long-empty 
wrought iron torch holders punctuating the journey.

Northern Walkway Over a Roaring Sewage Pipe~
   This frightfully narrow limestone ledge sweeps east and west 
into the abyssal darkness. Here and there the sculpted stone is 
dotted with holes and pock marks where an iron walkway once 
clung, surely less precarious then than in its current state. 
Southward, across a wide, man-made channel in the earth, can be 
seen a virtually identical ledge. A fat auxiliary sewage pipe 
made of rusted iron is barely visible in the blackness below, 
where it nestles in the belly of the channel carved to 
accommodate it. A twisted remnant of the walkway that once hung 
here forms a crude platform nearby, with a heap of timber and 
refuse threatening to drag it, too, down into the pit. One crack 
in the wall is wide enough for a man to squeeze through.

A Plunge Down a Limestone Wall~
   Above, a slippery, narrow brick ledge is sucked out of view as 
a wide iron sewage pipe looms immediately to the south, almost 
within reach of the limestone wall. A pocket between the pipe 
and the channel dug to house it waits below, strewn with stone 
and iron debris and choked in darkness. Meanwhile, the heaving 
whoosh of fast-moving sewage is deafening and ever-present.

A Cramped Pit Beneath a Roaring Pipe~
   In this narrow pocket between the wall of the fat iron pipe 
and the channel cut to hold it, the sound and smell of rushing 
sewage assails the senses. The space between the pipe and the 
channel wall is hardly wide enough for a set of average human 
shoulders to squeeze through, but to the east and west the 
man-made groove stretches on into a black, fathomless expanse. 
The cacophonous pipe looms less than a foot to the south, rising 
overhead to some fifteen feet below the narrow ledge above. The 
twisted remains of an iron walkway litter the ground.

Southern Walkway Over a Roaring Sewage Pipe~
   The narrow limestone blocks that make up this ledge are slick 
with atmospheric moisture and the barest misstep is likely to 
plunge one into the cold blackness below. Deep scores and pocked 
holes, some of them clutching twisted bits of rusty iron, seem 
once to have secured a metal walkway. To the east and west the 
ledge narrows and disappears into the lifeless dark, though 
progress toward the east is blocked by a bent, rusty iron 
platform piled with debris and timber. Below, a hulking sewer 
pipe can just be glimpsed running through the man-made channel 
that houses it.

Along a Narrow Walkway Over a Sheer Drop~
   It is only possible to progress along the ledge here by 
standing flush with the limestone wall at the south, and even 
then the toes of larger feet are likely to hang over the edge. 
Below, the man-made channel eats into the distant dark, a fat 
iron sewage pipe distantly visible where it runs east from there. 
To the west a slick limestone wall bearing a rusted iron grate 
emerges from the blackness.

A Dank Crawl Space~
   Dark, cramped and slippery, this small limestone tunnel could 
not have been intended for regular traffic. Nevertheless, its 
squarish dimensions are sufficient to accommodate all but the 
largest Men. The hand-hewn bricks are chipped and poorly 
maintained, and in some places the mortar has receded enough to 
loosen them. To the west the crawl space curves southward as it 
slopes deeper into the earth, while to the east a rusted iron 
grate leads out onto a narrow ledge.

Before a Grate Looking Into a Disused Tunnel~
   The limestone blocks that form this narrow channel in the 
earth are wet and scored, a few deep pits carved out by years of 
dripping from above. It is necessary to crawl on all fours to 
progress through the tunnel, and going is difficult toward the 
north where the floor slopes upward rather severely. To the 
west, a rusted iron grate looks out into a disused maintenance 
tunnel from ten feet above the floor. When distant echoes of 
roaring sewage cease periodically, a strange murmur can sometimes 
be heard.

A Dark, Bustling Antechamber~
   The ceiling here rises high over head, lending this room a 
officious air. The floor is of grey stone bricks that have been 
laid in a spiraling pattern originating in the center of the 
floor and widening as it reaches the walls. The large 
rectangular stones of the walls have been well laid. The air is 
musty and heavy and allows a thin patina of mold to grow on just 
about every surface.

A Seedy Back Office~
   Large stones have been carved into rectangular blocks and 
fitted together expertly, precluding the need for mortar. They 
comprise the walls floor and ceiling of this small room. It 
seems though that years of disuse have allowed moisture to 
collect here and green mold grows in every crevice and crack. 
The floor stones are smaller and fit together in a crude mosaic 
that is smooth underfoot.

An Ancient Dormitory~
   Built on a long axis this room stretches east and west to some 
length. It is narrow as it spans north and south. The flooring 
is basic a grey stone brick that has been laid with little regard 
to the aesthetic. Large rectangular stones comprise the walls 
and have been laid without mortar. Moisture has entered the area 
and opportunistic fungus clings to the walls ceiling and floor.

roughly square, large, and comprised of grey unadorned stone. It 
looks to have been designed with an eye for function over form. 
What look to be heavy, ancient grease stains show on the brick 
flooring and the walls are marked with patches of fungus and

A Wide, Hand-Dug Conference Room~
   This room was dug out by hand, and the walls still show marks 
of the axe and pick. The walls arch overhead to form a dome 
shaped ceiling, which is covered with tighly fitted bricks. Over 
the years, many of these bricks have fallen, and some are held in 
place only by the mold that grows here.

An Ancient Armory~
   Low ceiling, this room looks to have been constructed at the

a lower ceilinged than the rest of the building and was likely 
utilized as a storeroom. Heavy stones carved into uniformly 
large blocks make up the walls floor and ceiling. Moisture and 
disuse has allowed fungus to grow and dirt to collect in the 
cracks and crevices between the stones.

'The Hole In The Wall'~
   Crudely dug out from the very earth, this dark den is lit by 
dozens of dribbling beeswax candles, in many cases glued to the 
small tables and benches they stand on by their own melted wax. 
The cramped, irregular cavern is littered with mats and pallets 
which are frequently slept or lounged upon by flophouse 
patrons--some better kept than others. A small staff of scruffy, 
demoralized urchins waits on the most well-to-do guests while the 
rest are evidently left to fend for themselves. To the west, a 
pair of saloon doors leads back into the vault.

End of Tunnel~
   Measuring several handspans high and twice as many wide, the

although there are some small gaps between some of the stones. 
More stones, approximately the size of a human fist, make up the 
floor here and render it cobble like. The air is thick and heavy 
with moisture. Buttressing the ceiling and walls are well made 
columns of stone.

comprising the floor reveal a gentle patern. A light fog seems 
to have settled low to the ground in the area and slightly 
obscures things there. A handspan in width, the pillars and 
crossbeams in this area are spaced close together.

Maintenance Tunnel North of an Intersection~
   Heavy retangular stone bricks have been well laid to produce a 
uniform surface of the walls and ceiling. The small stones 
comprising the floor reveal a gentle patern. The air hangs heavy 
with moisture and the smell of molds and other fungus in the 
area. Cracked and broken, a pillar lies here crumbled. Its 
crossbeam hangs percariously overhead.

   Great grey bricks have been well placed here, rendering the 
walls and ceiling uniform planes. Smaller rocks have been 
carefully assembled to form an even floor. Moisture hangs heavy 
in the air providing ample opportunity for a plethora of fungus 
like vegetation which hangs off every surface. A single broad 
pillar rises from the center of this area, supporting a starlike 
pattern of crossbeams which span to the walls.

comprising the walls and ceiling here have barely discernable

Head of Southern Sewage Tunnel~
   The ground is completely hidden beneath the putrid brownish 
water and a thick layer of foul-smelling sludge, making it 
impossible to see the floor. The stench that rises from the muck 
is made worse by the damp and the cold; it clings to everything 
and gives the air a bitter taste. The sewage flows through the 
rusted grating on it's way to the southern sections of the city. 
The grating itself is solidly embedded in the surrounding stone.

functional stove set in one corner. There is hardly enough room

A Tight Hole in the Earth~
   Just inside this tight hole one would linger only for a few 
moments with their feet pressed against the sidewall to keep them 
from falling further into the murky depths below. The hole is 
lined with crumbling clay tile, weakened by many years of 
trickling and flowing water. A solitary copper pipe, 
approximately the size of a large fist in diameter, disappears 
into the floor above, off to one side and dumps straight into the 
hole below. A humid stench rises from deep in the bowels of the 
earth, assaulting the senses of any here. 
   Just above, the jagged remnants of floorboards leading to an 
interior room have been shoved aside, creating just enough room 
for one to worm their way through. Below is an unknown darkness, 
lurking.

A Tight Squeeze Inside a Clay Tile~
   The crumbling walls of this tight tile press in tightly about 
any who try to climb up or down the vertical shaft. There are 
precious few handholds, though enough to allow a skilled climber 
access. The clay tile is coated with a rotted, slick fungus, 
making passage all the more difficult. Any movement should be 
made with extreme care, lest one slip and fall. 
   The tile continues above at least the span of a man, the 
jagged remnants of broken boards covering the opening. The tile 
reaches downwards, a wretched stench wafting upwards upon a humid 
draft.

A particular sharp shard of clay juts out of the northern side of 
the shaft while the opposite side holds little hope for safe 
passage as a blunt stone bulges from the lining. A putrid stench 
wafts from below on a humid draft to assault the olfactory.

temporary sewer descs for NIMROD~
   The smell of sewage is thick in the air, though none of the 
putrid stuff is actually present in this chamber. The small 
square room seems the be some sort of outflow for a number of 
pipes. Judging from the circular holes along the walls and the 
long channels in the floor, it serves to collect the liquid and 
send it elsewhere; there is a single large grate in the center of 
the floor, and the sound of water is clearly audiable beyond it.

   The tunnel splits here in three directions, the river of 
sewage flowing in from the east and turning down a slight 
incline, heading southward. Above the muck, along the walls, are 
narrow stone ledges, allowing passage further into the sewers. A 
drier corridor branches off from this one, its floor made of the 
same dark, grime-covered stone as the walls.

The dark, grime-covered walls are slick with moisture, and the 
sound of dripping water is clearly audiable. A narrow stone 
walkway runs along the walls, forming a bridge across the tunnel 
mouth where the sewage enters. There are no other obvious 
passageways, though there are several rusted grates set into the 
walls, right at the surface of the putrid liquid, apparently 
allowing the tank to drain.

   With a twist akin to that of a serpent, the sewers curve here. 
Ancient in design, they have fallen into somewhat of a state of 
disrepair. Rubble apprears sporadicaly along the paths flanking 
the sewage channel, having fallen from the arc of the walls and 
ceiling. A great bit of refuse churns northwards, issuing forth 
a stench of bile and decay. Darkness shrouds everything, hiding 
the mysteries of the tunnel's construction from all but close 
inspection. Rats scurry along the old stones with a constant 
presence. 
   To the north and south, the sickly tunnel contiunes its lonely 
trek into the darkness.

A Damp, Stagnant Tunnel~
   A dank an opressive odor hangs here, wafting from a channel 
inbetween narrow walkways. Arched overhead, a tunnel of ancient 
design continues down to enclose the ground; a squeezing grip of 
stone despair. The stones themselves seem to glisten and almost 
ooze a greenish, smelly substance. In the channel, the sludge 
flows through with a near impossible quickness, unstuck even by 
the portions of debris collected randomly. 
   Eastwards, a large portion of the wall has fallen away, 
revealing a passage into a nearby chamber. To the north and 
south, the sewers continue into shadow.

A Putrid-Smelling Tunnel~
   Within the confines of this stone tunnel, one can see much 
time has passed since its creation. Its walls have cracked, some 
portions have fallen in; broken rock strewn about the ground. 
The darkness shrouds nearly every detail of this place forgotten, 
giving little information on the odds and ends of its 
construction. The sound of dripping water is prominent every 
step of the way, falling from above due to rain, or any other 
wide variety of wastes. A channel filled with sludge water runs 
quickly with its current, speeding towards its forelorned end. 
On either side of the channel sits narrow walkways of stone, 
sometimes trecherous in footing, slick for traction. A 
disagreeable afluvia is thick and heavy. 
   To the north and south, the sickly tunnel contiunes its lonely 
trek into the darkness.

Treacherous Sewer Tunnel~
   Once an outstanding acheivement of construction, this section 
of tunneling has fallen into disrepair. Large stone blocks have 
fallen from the walls and upper arch of the ceiling, some laying 
in the channel proper, blocking the constant movement of dank 
sewage. The smell is putrid here, seeming to eminate from 
everything. Shadows enclose the area, hiding crooks and 
crannies, and the tide of rats that warm from holes in the walls. 
   Some of the eastern footpath has crumbled away to oblivion, a 
sinkhole opening under it. A smelly stream of waste drips 
heavily into it. North and south, the tunnels continue into 
darkness

thick brownish-green liquid filled with floating refuse and other 
putrid things. The smell rising off its surface is quite strong, 
giving the cold air an almost bitter taste. On either side of 
the passageway, attached to the wall above the flowing liquid, 
are two narrow stone walkways. Both are slick with moisture, 
making for precarious footing. The walls and ceiling are riddled 
with cracks, and some of the grimy stones jut out at odd angles 
from the ceiling, hanging precariously overhead.

A Dilapidated Sewage Tunnel~
   The tunnel here is in ill-repair, with cracks running across 
the grime-covered walls and loose bits of stone jutting out from 
the ceiling at odd angles. The river of sewage flowing through 
this section is filled with floating debris and garbage, along 
with the occasional bloated rat carcass. Two narrow walkways are 
attached to each wall, well above the putrid liquid, though not 
far enough to avoid the stench rising from the muck. The dank 
air is filled with the smell of waste and rotten things, which 
give it a sharp, almost bitter taste.

A Curving Sewer Tunnel~
   With a twist akin to that of a serpent, the sewers curve here. 
Ancient in design, they have fallen into somewhat of a state of 
disrepair. Rubble appears sporadically along the paths flanking 
the sewage channel, having fallen from the arc of the walls and 
ceiling. A great bit of refuse churns northwards, issuing forth 
a stench of bile and decay. Darkness shrouds everything, hiding 
the mysteries of the tunnel's construction from all but close 
inspection. Rats scurry along the old stones with a constant 
presence. 
   To the north, south, and west, the sickly tunnel continues its 
lonely trek into the darkness.

An Unsavory Sewer Tunnel~
   This dank tunnel extends to the north and south, the ends 
disappearing into darkness. A river of greenish-brown sewage 
runs through the center of the passageway, the putrid liquid 
filled with all manner of unsavory things. Two narrow walkways, 
one attached to each wall, provide relatively dry footing above 
the slowly flowing water. There are large cracks in some of the 
grime-covered stones, and a few even jut out precariously 
overhead, looking as if they might be ready to fall. The air is 
cold and reeks of rotten things and other kinds of waste.

A Cold, Dank, And Slimy Sewer Tunnel~
   The tunnel is cold and dank, and much of it seems coated in 
layers of slime. A river of putrid water runs through here, its 
surface covered in thick, greenish-brown sludge. Above the 
slowly flowing sewage are two narrow walkways, each one attached 
to a wall. Most of the slimy, grime-black stones are slick with 
moisture; the source of the liquid appears to be several long 
cracks in the ceiling. The constant dripping echoes down the 
passageway, accompanied by the occasional sounds of vermin. The 
air is cold and reeks of rotten things.

At An Offshoot Tunnel In the Sewers~
   A slightly smaller offshoot tunnel joins the main one here, 
bringing in more waste and causing the putrid waters to swirl. 
Two narrow stone walkways are attached to each wall above the 
thick greenish-brown liquid, and a narrow stone bridge allows 
access across the entrance of the eastern passage. The sewage 
flows in from the south and east, heading north to some final 
destination.

A Reeking, Dilapidated Sewage Tunnel~
   This cold, humid tunnel reeks of waste and other rotten
things. Two narrow walkways attached to the walls, one on each
side of the passageway, extend outward over a slowly flowing
river of sewage. The noxious odor rising from the surface of the
sludge is quite strong, and gives the air a bitter taste. The
stones in this part of the sewer appear to be in rather bad
condition; covered in layers of grime and riddled with cracks,
it seems that it may have been a long time since this place was
last repaired. Even the ceiling has dents and leaks; a steady
drip splatters down from overhead, making nearby surfaces slick
and slippery.
   The sewer continues to the north and south, disappearing
into darkness.

river of sewage that flows through here. From somehwere nearby, 
there is a steady drip which echoes loudly over the sound of the

A Deteriorating Sewage Tunnel~
   The cracks in the tunnel walls are large and jagged, and many 
of the deep crevices ooze brownish liquid that seeps into the 
grimy stones and makes the ground underfoot somewhat slick. Two 
narrow walkways, one on each side of the corridor, extend out 
above the river of sewage that flows through here. The cold, 
dank air has a sharp, bitter taste and smells of rot and waste. 
   Putrid liquid flows in from the south, heading northward at a 
slow, steady pace. The ends of the passage are not visible, as 
they disappear into the darkness.

A Crumbling Sewage Tunnel~
   Despite the constant width of this sewer tunnel, the amount of 
debris blocking the river of sludge below has caused it to narrow 
severely in places. As it flows in from the south, it splashes 
over the fallen obstructions, spraying nearby surfaces with the 
putrid liquid. Gaps in the ceiling indicate just how badly this 
section is in need of repair. Hanging low overhead, other stones 
jut out at odd angles, and the cracked, gray-black of the 
shadowed crevices between them gives glimpses of the ancient 
stonework beneath. Two walkways, one attached to either side of 
the passageway, allow acces above the waste-filled waters, but 
here and there, puddles have formed from seepage through the 
grimy walls, and have made the ground underfoot slick with 
moisture. The air, too, is dank, and has a sharp, bitter taste, 
smelling of rot and other worse things.

the sewage flowing in from the west and surging northward. A 
foul smell rises from the surface of the putrid sludge, giving 
the dank air a sharp, bitter taste. Two narrow walkways, one 
attached to each side of the passage, allow access above the 
thick brown water, though the slick surface underfoot is still 
somewhat precarious to walk upon. Here and there, liquid seeping 
through the grimy black stones has formed shallow puddles, and 
there is a constant sound of dripping that echoes down the

Before A Collapsed Section of Tunnel In The Sewers~
   It seems the deterioration of the stonework in this area has 
become quite severe; to the south, the an entire section of the 
tunnel has collapsed, completely blocking access to whatever lies 
beyond. However, there appears to be a large amount of liquid 
seeping through the debris, the putrid water pooling briefly as 
it runs over broken stone, and then flowing east, forming a river 
of sewage that surges off into the darkness. The are fragments 
of what once were walkways attached to each side of the corridor, 
but passage now is trecherous, as the remaining ground is either 
covered in sludge or dangerously slippery from all the moisture. 
The dank air carries the stench of rot and waste, and has a 
sharp, bitter taste to it. Constant dripping echoes loudly from 
somewhere in the shadows, and the occasional skittering or 
frantic splash can occasionally be heard.

Below Fountain in Old Market~
   The tunnel curves here, the river of sewage flowing in from 
the east and turning north, its surface covered in sludge and 
froth. Bits of garbage can be seen floating in the muck, along 
with the occasional dead rat. Attached to each side of the 
corridor are narrow walkways, allowing passage above the putrid 
water. Puddles have formed in several places, likely due to the 
near-constant dripping from above. Cracks run across the ceiling 
in jagged lines, and a thin, slimy substance seems to be oozing 
down. The grime-blackened stones are fairly rough, save for one 
in the wall to the west, and the liquid that has spread over them 
has made them fairly slick. The slippery floor and the 
ever-present moisture may make travel difficult, but the stench 
that hangs in the dank air is nearly as much of an obstacle. The 
scent of rot and decay mingles with the smell of waste and bile, 
giving each breath a sharp, bitter taste. Now and again, the 
sound of vermin skittering off somewhere in the shadows echoes 
back from the darkness.

against the eastern wall, leaving smears of sickly brown. Pipes 
set into the ceiling are constantly spewing water down into the 
muck, all of which seems to be making steady progress westward in 
a thick, but steadily-moving river. Narrow walkways attached to 
each side of the tunnel allow passage above the putrid liquid, 
but the splashing has made them slick and slimy. The air is dank 
and smells of waste, and has a sharp, bitter taste. The

it to hold a large quantity of flood waters. It is slightly 
conical in shape, with the floor being square, and leading up to 
a dome-like ceiling. A large channel sinks into the floor, 
sloping slightly to the south, and stones tunnel high overhead 
along with it. The sides of the channel act as pathways. Sewage 
water flows quickly here, spewing out of the culvert with 
fantastic speed.

Within a Picturesque Hall~
   The lazy haze of candlelight sits like small fireflies trapped 
within intricately-wrought candlesticks mounted to the boundaries 
of this picturesque hall. Yet they are not the sole contributors 
of light, for in numerous areas the walls have been cunningly cut 
into compartments several feet long which carry candles set 
behind exquisite stained-glass doors. The wicks in their stone 
hollows are kept eternally burning, causing the glass scenes to 
glow from within and expand into an ethereal film of colour over 
the surrounding wall. Grandiose pillars lead to a vaulted 
ceiling that is fitted with several lengths of thick glass. 
Those who walk below it are often cast into dappled shade as the 
leaves of the trees outside cascade gently upon its surface: 
small zephyrs that rarely remain peaceful or still. One of the 
more prominent features of the hallway is the ripple of running 
water from a small pool set within a granite foundation by the

rock-carved surface, guided by inlets to form small rivers. It 
runs around the rounded opening of fireplace that sits in the 
likeness of a caves mouth, eventually flowing into the pool-like 
basin below it.

Inside a Curving Hallway~
This hallway sports a predominantly rounded ceiling supported 
by stone beams that create various, tapering arches. Each stone 
arch has been painted carefully with branches and leaves, none
exactly the same as the other. The limbs curve rather elaborately
and often vanish into clusters of leaves only to emerge again
inches later. Far less obvious and more suggestive in its colours
is the embossing upon the floor below. Abstract swirls of gold and
desatured viridian that is only barely visible even in direct light.
Placed upon the wall in equal intervals is a line of candlebra
set with beeswax candles. The hallway curves in a circular fashion, 
leading towards a large open chamber to the west and a smaller 
one, in comparison, to the south. The hallway leads to a large 
area to the north and a smaller one, in comparison, to the east.

Kitchen~
   This kitchen is quite large despite the warmth of its 
atmosphere. There is the scent of mahogany and mint constant in 
the air, escaping from various potted plants hanging from 
intricate iron hooks upon the wall. The walls are thick, the 
bright white stone having been ingeniously designed to allow one 
passage for all the smoke from the interconnecting funnels of the 
various fireplaces in the building to run through to the great 
chimney above. Not one bit of it escaping into the room itself. 
The floor is divided into tiles that has been placed within the 
bed of a creamy mortar. The stone of the tiles are a pale, 
powder-blue, flecked with darker of aquamarine. Several square 
windows look out to a garden beyond.

Storage~
   This chamber has no windows of any kind and every inch has 
been made from cold, white stone. It is completely square in its 
design, its maker having provided little aesthetic beauty in its 
creation. Several rows and shelves sit against the walls, all 
made from stone. The only break in this appearance is the small 
veins of grey naturally found in the granite in some areas.

The Foyer to the Museum and Galleries~
   The sinuous underbodies of intertwining branches gleam a 
luminous shade of soft green, clinging mightily to the borders of 
the white walls against which they have been carved. The 
artificial path lines the way into a long hallway and forms a 
canopy that almost threatens to obfuscate the ceiling from sight. 
Here the lights stretches long and bright while labyrinth 
patterns of barely-there shadows spews in the mix, all created by 
torches placed between the manmade trees. Such care had gone 
into the creation of the trees, that the leaves have been dipped 
in paint iridescent and pure green. The floor is made from tiles 
of the same green stone and the extravagance of the foyer 
terminates ahead where a much larger area can be seen in wait. 
People are often found about the area, along with guardsmen who 
glance over small groups that pass, rarely left empty despite its 
great size. Here, the scent of linseed and oils prevails, 
softened only by the occasional gust through the great doorways 
that lead into the building.

A Landing by a Staircase~
   The railings of this staircase has been carved from its stone 
to resemble the trunks of sapling oaks which open up to flower 
into branches that support the banister. Some of the branches 
even dare to obtrude over the sides and pout over the very top to 
breach the spaces where a hand may normally find support. The 
banister has been inlaid with small leaf-like shapes of effulgant 
green stone that verges on being transparent. The staircase 
opens to a large landing where the high wall is set into two 
segments, seperated by a strip of pure white granite barely two 
inches thick. The top divide reaching down from the ceiling is a 
foot long, chiselled with llustration of trees. Their portrayal 
covers the entire upper length of the bright white wall for as 
far as it expands and have been filled with luminescent blue and 
green stone in their lines. Cresting candlesticks are mounted on 
the open spaces below. A window against the western wall 
provides a view of a tree-laced garden beyond its pane.

   A wide staircase winds it way against the wall to open up to 
this large platform that serves of the landing of the second 
story. The platform continues in a circular fashion, following 
along the spherical shape of the building itself until coming 
joining the staircase once more. The thick railing carries 
suggestions of lines shaped as ivy vines that creep over the 
railings which root it firmly to the ground. A more solid 
etching of leaves flowering at the very base and rising out of 
the stone itself, the colour of which is a pale, mint-green. 
Every few feet of the railing support circular, bowl-like dips in 
the stone, which have been filled with water that carry drifting 
candles. Vast, thick pillars shoot by the story and continue up 
to the great ceiling above.

The Hall of Dol-Amroth~
   A luxurious, royal-blue rug runs over the entire length of 
this spacious hallways floor, ending where it opens up to a 
platformed area past the borders of its threshold to the east. 
The hallway is wide of girth and offers a tall ceiling which is 
shielded by the presence of a thick drapery of cloth. The cloth 
runs along the walls in the likeness of restless, verdant green 
paint, just barely touching over the floor. In some areas its 
constricted by tassled ropes of golden-yellow, offering open 
spaces of stone upon which glass cases are mounted. Long-stemmed 
heavy iron brazier provide a constant light, high rims and 
curving claws that serve as mouthpieces protecting the coals deep 
inside and keeping any from spilling out.

This airy bathroom has a few elevated steps that lead to a 
round platform with a porcelain tub. The floor consists out of 
tiles of powder blue stone, set within a bed of white mortar. 
The entire ceiling is consumed with an immeasurable number of 
tiny, silver stars that have been hand-painted upon a pale cobalt 
backdrop. A tinted glass door is completely covered with 
spherical shapes remiscent of tumbling ocean-waves, allowing for 
any shape or form seen through it to become severely distorted 
and modestly concealed. A single round window sits nearby the 
ceiling, of the same type of glass as the door.

Within a Bedchamber~
   A thick, engraved doorway of dark oak wood leads into a large 
chamber with a luxuriously-soft, silvery-blue carpet covering the 
breadth of the floor. Tiered windows overlook the leaf-splashed 
canopies of trees which grow outside while brocade curtains that 
may otherwise have shadowed the sight are restrained by coiling, 
tassled ropes wrapped around their width. A large fireplace of 
pale blue marble advances into a chimney chased with veins of 
grey. Covering nearly the entire span of the southern wall is a 
scene delicately carved from pale blue stone. It shows the curl 
of oceans waves, and upon it small vessels with sails that are 
gently lazing in the wind. Gulls are etched above spaces where 
plumes of tumbling clouds roll into each other. Overall its an 
exquisite piece of artwork that becomes one of the focal points 
in the room. A thin, wave-engraved railing sits in a circle far 
above a large bed, attached to the wall. From it hangs threads 
of powder-blue silk that lap greedily over the ground, obscuring 
the bed itself with a gauzy cover.

into it, a work of art by its own right. The wood it is made of 
thick and heavy, providing an ideal canvas for the scene which

The fox is sitting amongst the roots of trees within a forest, 
large mushrooms growing out of the earth besides its paws. Its 
shown with its head held aloft, nose in the air. The door has 
been heavily varnished and laminated, the scent of the wood 
gently permeating the air. Windows with square bases overlook 
gardens beyond, the wood that the glass is nestled is ornamented 
with motifs of leaves and nuts. A small fireplace sits nestled 
within the western wall.

Within a Spacious Hall~
   This lofty hall is divided into chamber-like areas by the 
wooden screens that create the boundaries of each one. The frame 
of the screens has been cut from a dark pine, while thick, 
paper-like sheets are stretched from it. Its these areas that 
gives a base to watercolour works that drench each and every one 
with a different, daintily-painted display: many of them present 
trees or birds, pigments muted and hazy to such an extent that 
they almost fade into their background. Each compartment holds a 
thick rug beneath a bed which covers the stone floors and 
provides protection against the chills in the colder seasons, 
additionally, a large fireplace sits within the western western 
wall. Several windows are covered by thick, brocade curtains 
which can be pulled back and fastened to small iron hooks by 
tassled ropes.

Within a Lush Garden~
   Little disturbs the quiet patchwork of countless shades of 
green that grow here, ranging from pale silvery jades to deep 
olive. In places, rock outcroppings protrude above the lush 
foliage, isolated caps of stone laid bare beneath the open sky 
and a favourite haunt of birds often seen circling lazily on 
updrafts. Marigolds and lavender grow abundantly in random 
clumps while dark-leafed ivy winds itself like thread around the 
trunks of mammoth trees, hanging loose from the branches to laze 
within the air. While an ancient wall of thick grey stone keeps 
this splash of nature isolated, the rooftops of buildings can be 
seen from behind its guard.

Within a Lush Garden by a Pool~
   Crickets play their dreamy adagios to a murmuring audience of 
age-hewn trees and oak saplings set in a great ring about a pool 
that stretches here between the grass. Numerous reeds grow 
besides it, coyly chattering over their beds as they bend to the 
wind, while a constant counterpoint of soft whispers woven 
together with the waters altogether drown out other noises. 
Between the gnarled roots of trees a kaleidoscope of green and 
gold soaks the sights. A rustling, shifting ocean knee-deep with 
the brush of bristles with clinging prickly, spear-shaped leaves. 
Amidst poplars and long-stalked lavender plants is the pale puff 
of dandelions while delicate daises peek out from within the 
grass, petals sometimes torn from them by the wind and scattered 
about the gardens. While an ancient wall of thick grey stone 
keeps this splash of nature isolated, the rooftops of buildings 
can be seen from behind its guard.

a nut ready to be nibbled, perched upon a large, gnarled branch 
that has been tenderly enhanced by depth in the wood. Its tail 
is rather lush and its ears a bit too big, while a set of 
whiskers have been carved as fine lines from its cheeks. The 
door has been heavily varnished and laminated, the scent of the 
wood gently permeating the air. Windows with square bases 
overlook gardens outside, the wood that the glass is nestled in 
is ornamented with motifs of leaves and nuts. A small fireplace 
sits nestled within the western wall.

Within Large, Gnarled Branches.~
   Branches spill in reference towards the sky while wayward 
limbs shoot out in all directions, gnarled and crooked from the 
weight of age. Many of the ancient trees leaves are curled and 
withered at the tips with age, forgotten upon stalks which sprout 
younger and more supple ones on other offshoots. Life clings to 
the tree in the form of constant flutter from birdwings and 
patches of mass that have found a home for itself between the 
texturing dips of its bark. Patches of sky show beneath the gaps 
of the great trees canopy, which has been thickened by the 
presence of the intrusive growth from neighborings trees own.

South of a Large Landing~
 A rather wide hallway winds it way against the wall along the 
spherical shape of the building. A thick railing carries 
suggestions of lines shaped as ivy vines that creep over the 
railings which root it firmly to the ground. A more solid 
etching of leaves flowering at the very base and rising out of 
the stone itself, the colour of which is a pale, mint-green. 
Every few feet of the railing support circular, bowl-like dips in 
the stone, which have been filled with water that carry drifting 
candles. Vast, thick pillars shoot by the story and continue up 
to the great ceiling above.

Within A Closet~
   Turned sconces of clear glass cast a warm glow over the entire 
space of this walk-in closet, reflecting lightly off the polished 
oak pannels of the wall. A soft carpet has been laid under foot, 
dyed a rich blue in colour. Upon it, various small cupboards and 
wardrobes have been placed each holding ample room to store 
dozens of garments.

A Short Hallway~
   This short hallway has doors to the north, west, and south, 
and a set of stairs leading up. The walls are the same clean 
white stone, while the floor is the dark-stained oaken planks. 
Simple glass lanterns hang upon the walls to provide lighting. 
The door back out to the main house is to the east.

A Peaceful Garden and Fountain~
   This garden offers a calm distraction from the hustle and 
bustle of the city life. The area is fenced in by a stone wall 
covered in ivy, blocking the outside noise and sights from 
curious neighbors or on lookers. A variety of plants grow in 
different types of flowers beds along a stone walkway that leads 
to a simple fountain, flanked by a pair of benches. The smell of 
herbs and fragrant flowers fill the air. Another pathway to the 
south indicates that the garden continues on in that direction 
while the glass door back inside leads to the north.

   The room is lit during the day by the light of the sun that 
comes through the rather large, thick, shuttered windows. When 
the shutters are open the garden can be seen right outside. 
Simple glass lanterns hang upon the white stone walls to provide 
additional illumination if needed. Finely crafted 
floor-to-ceiling bookcases line the walls, while darkly-stained 
oaken planks make up the flooring.

   The clean white stone wall that runs through the entire house 
continues in this room as well, but here, padding has been added 
to the walls. The windows are set high up in the wall to let in 
the light as well as to ventilate the room. Against the northern 
wall, racks line the wall with a wide variety of shields and 
weapons. In the middle of the room a circle has cleared out to 
create a sparring ring and training area. On the western corner 
a rope hangs from the ceiling it and looks sturdy enough to climb 
on.

Upstairs Hallway~
   This hallway continues the theme of the house. Dark oaken 
planks running the length of the short and relatively narrow 
floor, flanked on either side by the white stone walls. A 
staircase of the same rich wood rises out of the floor to spill 
out into this hallway and a simple door sits in each of the 
flanking walls on the east and west sides. The northern wall, 
directly ahead of the top of the staircase, bears a small window 
to allow some light into the hallway. Simple glass lanterns hang 
upon the wall to provide ample light when the sun is down.

cozy room. A soft yet durable rug of rich grey tones covers the 
center area of the floor. On the southern wall, a circular 
window provides ample light during the day and a view of the 
surrounding city. Simple glass lanterns hang upon the white

   The walls are fashioned of the same clean white stone that 
runs through the entire house. Large windows against the 
southern wall provide a panoramic view of the surrounding city, 
and the street and garden below. Simple glass lanterns hang upon 
the wall to provide ample light when natural light is not 
sufficient. The fireplace is set completely into the northern 
wall providing plenty of warmth on those cold winter nights, for 
both this room and the one to the north. Darkly-stained oaken 
planks, the majority of which are covered over with a soft, yet 
durable rug of rich dark blue, make up the floor of this cozy 
room. To the north is the entryway that leads to another room, 
while the door that exits the bedroom lays to the east.

A Luxurious Bathing and Dressing Area~
   Along the southern wall, a fireplace has been built to provide 
warmth to this room and the one to the south. The room seems to 
be split in two. One side holds the bathing area while the other 
is geared to be a dressing area. The clean white stone walls 
continue even in this room especially in the bathing area, where 
even the floor is of the white stone. A bathing tub takes up the 
majority of the space in that area, while hooks have been set on 
the wall to hang towels or clothes from them. A small circular 
window provides ample light during the day during the day, 
sitting high enough to provide plenty of privacy. In the 
dressing area the darkly-stained oaken planks make up the floor, 
a good portion of it covered by a soft yet durable rug of dark 
blue. Shelves and other furniture line the walls giving it 
plenty of room to store clothing and other things.

line the southern wall while two large doors to the east lead out 
into the clearing. A smaller door is set into the southern wall 
leading into the western workshop. A wooden ladder leads up into 
the loft of the barn. The scent of earth and animals fills the 
air.

dirt that gives the air an earthen scent. Though the area is 
smaller than the barn, it provides considerable space to do 
various sorts of work in. The sounds and smells of animals can

   A well maintained small orchard of fruit trees, takes up a 
good portion of this yard. Under a set of trees a nice garden 
table sits in their shade. On the left side of the yard sits a 
tool rack and what looks like a shed. The smell of plant life 
and compost fills the air. The stone walls are covered with ivy 
though towards the back it looks like the ivy grows in the shape 
of a door.

Foyer Behind the Storefront~
   Freshly updated, this chamber stretches from the shopfront 
towards the kitchen at the far end. The walls boast impressively 
carved maple paneling three feet up the wall, and freshly painted 
plaster between oaken beams reaching to the ceiling above. The 
chamber's ceiling holds a brass-fitted and crystal chandelier 
hanging from an iron chain which lights the room. 
   To one side of the room, a light-stained maple staircase 
climbs to an upper floor.

A Modest Kitchen~
   A cold, stone slab floor of well fitted stones with fitted 
wooden planks on the walls and ceiling enclose this modest area. 
The room is windowless and lit by the golden light cast off by 
the wicks from brass lanterns strategically placed around the 
room. A well made door provides egress to the foyer and a large 
iron-rimmed door opens to a dark, downward-leading staircase. 
   While not as elegantly appointed as the rest of the house, 
there are many touches of rustic decoration, including a section 
of the wall painted with an abundance of small flowers.

   This dark cellar is used to store wines, dry goods and other 
perishables used by the household. The well-fitted plank walls 
are lined with rows of shelving and several sturdy, planed wooden 
beams support the ceiling. The air is cool and dry, and the 
stone slab floor is cold to the touch. 
   A steep wooden staircase leads up to a trapdoor in the 
ceiling. A blue-painted door leads to a workshop.
