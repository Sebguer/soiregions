Inside the Covered Battering Ram~
   Inside a A-framed shaped Structure of wood. The sides are made of
heavy wood planking and angle steeply to a heavy oaken beam at the apex.
Hanging on heavy iron chains, attached to the oaken beam is an iron-tipped,
hardened battering ram. It looks like there is room enough for eight to ten
men inside. That number of handles have been mounted firmly to the hardened
ram allowing the men strong grips. The front and back of the structure are
open, allowing for the fullest amount of travel for the ram.

   Having obviously seen better days, this dilapidated wagon

cracked, except in several areas where old broken boards have 
been replaced anew. A tattered canvas canopy covers the wagon, 
keeping the inside somewhat protected from the elements.

The Woods of Orome~
   This ancient wood bears with it a sense of tranquility and 
appears to be a sanctuary for the wildlife that inhabits it. 
There is no indication of any bird or beast of prey residing in 
the area, and this obviously attributes to the abundant fauna 
that eagerly roam the wood. Not far to the east stands the 
Pelori, grandest of mountain ranges and the dwelling place of the 
mightiest spirits of Aman. To the north and west lie the green 
pastures of Yavanna, where grows the fairest flowers in all of 
Valinor.

Amandil's Pixie Palace of Love~
   Plush pillows set about in a heart shape litter the ground. 
The smell of french vanilla candles seem to come from no where. 
All around you are romantic looking items from candies, to paper 
hearts, to missives about long lost lovers. There seems to be 
some method to the madness but that is yet to be determined.

The Portals of Pelori~
   Here stands one of the many peaks of Pelori, the mighty 
mountain-fence of Aman that spans most of the continent. From 
the summit of this mountain, one can see the ancient ocean to the 
east and the mighty Wood of Orome bordering the range to the 
west. Far to the north, Taniquetil rises in all of its might and 
bears up the halls of Ilmarin, wherein dwells Manwe, Lord of the 
Winds and mightiest of the Valar. At the center of the peak lies 
a column of carven stone shaped and wrought from the same white 
mineral that forms the mountain. Upon it rests an orb of some 
pure, colorless jewel, shimmering and brilliant to look upon.
