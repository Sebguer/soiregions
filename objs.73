a scalemail-framed shishak helm~
A pointed shishak helm of iron framed in scalemail lies here.~
   This iron helmet has a pointed dome reinforced by fittings 
down the front and back, as well as its sides. It sits low over 
the brow, curving down between the eyes. A plain nose guard, 
narrow at the top but widening as it covers the face, provides 
additional protection for the face. A scale-mail skirt surrounds 
the bottom of the helm, sitting all the way down to the 
shoulders. While it curves down around the ears and forward to 
protect the cheeks and jaw, hanging like a veil over the lower 
face, it does not truly obscure its wearer's identity.

a bit of tied leather cording in place to hold it in place when 
worn.

a $color, rope headband~
A short coil of $color rope has been left here.~
   Fashioned by braiding many cords of "$color" silk, this looks 
to be little more than a thin rope. It is just long enough to 
tie around one's hair to secure it out of one's face. The ends 
are elaborately knotted to keep it from unraveling, each knot 
cleverly hidden with its neighboring cords.

in little seed beads of bright colors. The different colors 
spiral around each other in a vaguely deliberate pattern. Made 
to fit about the head and secure hair from the wearer's face, the 
ends narrow into a braided rope to make it easier to tie 
together.

A twisted leather cord of $color lays coiled here.~
The simplicity of this cord is overlooked by the clever way it 
has been cut to twist and coil about itself. A few decorative 
knots have been worked into the cord, especially elaborate at the 
ends. When laid out on a flat surface, it almost resembles a 
brown snake, one knotted end appearing like a snake's head.

kamis yelek frost white gossamer thin silk UNIQUE-pNur HARADRIM TEXTILE TEXTILE~
a gossamer-thin kamis under a frost white silk yelek~
A gossamer-thin kamis, with a frost white silk yelek over it, lies pooled here.~
   Buttoned at the neck with a gold cobra-carved bead, and 
falling all the way to the ankle, this gossamer-thin silk chiffon 
kamis is made of whisper-soft frost white fabric. Its sleeves, 
loose and slightly bloused, terminate at the wrist in a stiff 
cuff of gold-embroidered linen, heavy weight and curving up to a 
point on the top of the hand. The embroidery is more rounded, 
flowing, and forms a striking cobra in the middle of the stiff 
cuff. It clings to the skin, soft and draping, giving just a 
hint of what lies under it. Covering this risque sheath is a 
flowing, heavier-weight silk yelek, dyed frost white. Little 
more than an open front and side vest on top, connected around 
the waist into four unconnected pannels of the skirt-like lower 
half, it is sleeveless and open down the front, the vest-like 
upper portion just barely providing a degree of modesty for the 
bust. Made of a rich frost white silk, it is embroidered in 
gold, with an intricate striking-cobra pattern. It falls in 
panels around the clinging skirt of the kamis. Each panel is 
decorated with a delicate gold cutwork of striking-cobra, 
matching in frost white the wispy kamis under it.

scallops embellishes the edges. Accenting its embroidery, trios 
of delicate bells have been attached around the slipper's mouth, 
creating a soft tinkling sound whenever the wearer walks.

The legs of the pants are loose, and they gather into a short,

tucked into a pair of calf-high boots while still appearing 
debonair.

back is still brazenly revealing, as the coverage, like the 
front, is also asymmetrical and connects by a secure button along 
the side. Beaded ribbon of black embellishes the sloping 
neckline, the lower hemline, and the cuff of the sleeve.

blackened. Decorative vines and small flowers have been etched 
all along the entirety of it, the carvings added after the 
blackening to allow it to give up a slightly bright shine from 
the rest of the key.

A small, black iron key lies here, fixed to an orange ribbon.~
   This key has been fashioned of black iron. Its size suggests 
that it would go to a chest or a cabinet door rather than a 
full-sized lock. A braided orange ribbon has been looped through 
the little eye on the handle, enabling it to be affixed upon a 
keyring.

   This infant has a tuft of inky colored hair atop his tiny,

A silk scarf is folded here, dyed $finecolor.~
   Rectangular in shape and long enough to wrap around the neck 
or tie about the head or face, the delicate fabric of this silk 
scarf feels nice against the skin. The thinness of it is 
obviously not meant to serve against cold weather. The edges 
have been rolled-stitched to prevent fraying. Along its hem, it 
is embroidered with short rows of raised lines, the thread a 
shade darker than the rest of the $finecolor cloth for only a 
subtle contrast.

   This happy, burbling baby is a prime example of health with 
his busy, fat little hands and dimpled knees. Set on his round 
face, bright black eyes are alert, easily distracted when he is 
awake. A small button nose and pouting lips nestle between his 
pudgy cheeks. His head is crowned generously with unruly black 
waves, and the whole of his baby-soft skin is a decidedly swarthy 
complexion.

   Thin strands of sinew have been wrapped around the quills of 
two hawk feathers, each bearing a notably red tinge to the barbs. 
Small clay beads, glazed $finecolor, have been knotted down the 
length of the sinew, serving to assist in entwining the adornment 
into one's hair. The feathers themselves appear well-kept and 
easily replaceable.

A halter of thinly woven $color wool lies here in a small pile.~
   Made from a thin weave of finely spun wool, the fabric has 
been dyed an uneven $color and has a nearly translucent quality 
to it. The weave itself is rather coarse, even if the wool is 
uncharacteristically soft. Having no darting over the chest, the 
halter wraps snugly under the breast line and reaches to the 
neck, fastening by a pair of sueded leather cords at the top and 
bottom, leaving much of back bared.

   This halter offers just the barest of coverage, made of sheer, 
undyed cotton gauze. Little more than a strip of cloth, clever 
twists and knots give it its shape around the wearer's body, 
wrapping from around the back and spreading over the breasts and 
finally ending in a heavily beaded strap that fixes the whole 
garment in asymmetrically. The long, flat beads are made of wood 
or clay and are each in varying shades of $color.

creating an almost sheer covering that can be worn in a wide

and supple suede pieces, unevenly rectangular and left its 
natural brown hue. A simple looping buckle has been affixed to 
either side of the loincloth, allowing complete adjustment at the 
wearer's hips and leaving the thighs and legs bared. The entire 
front flap is decorated with small claws, the tips dulled to a 
safe point and seeming to serve little purpose other than 
appearance.

A barbute helm with amethyst flame decoration lies here.~
   A smooth, rounded surface of well blackened metal encases the 
head of this helm's wearer. The pointed cheekguards extend up 
from the middle of the wearer's neck to leave a wide opening in 
front of the wearer's face. The opening is spanned by a finely 
made section of tightly-woven chainmail, attached securely down 
both sides. It leaves only a few fingers width between the top 
of the chain veil and the subtle brow of the helm. Bright 
amethyst flames roar up from the base of this helm, reaching up 
to near the top. The vibrant flame designs encircle the entire 
way around the helm from its bottom lip, contrasting the flat 
black metal with their intense purple color. The piece offers 
solid protection to ones head and the nape of their neck, masking 
all but their eyes behind the chain veil.

A bronze-detailed barbute helm with a crimson plume is here.~
   A tall crest of polished iron holds a long plume of crimson 
red-dyed horse hair that falls down behind the shoulders of the 
wearer. A finish of matte black deters any glare from the 
surface of the helm, but the intricate bronze filigree designs 
reflect any light that strikes their polished paths. The helm's 
spherical shape tapers down and rounds off at the middle of the 
wearer's neck, trimmed in a solid bronze. The opening arches up 
to reveal two oval openings for the eyes that meet and form an 
inch-wide slit that runs down the center of the wearer's face, 
ending in two concave pointed edges that protrude out from the 
middle of the neck.

shoulders exposed. And the vest covers the chest fully, ending 
just at the waist.

dye to help it stand out.

subtle shine. Deeply tooled over the surface is the stylized 
likeness of vines and desert flowers.

   A simply designed sheath, it has been reinforced with multiple 
layers of stiff leather. The initial layer is an uncolored brown 
shade, but the topmost layer is a paler shade. The pale leather 
has been engraved through to form the shape of a wing with 
feathers in minute detail, allowing the darker color to show 
through. A loop at the top of the sheath affixes it to a belt 
and a strap at the bottom would secure it to the thigh, 
preventing the weapon from swinging about.

   This quiver is little more than an uneven tube of leather, 
fixed with a cap at the bottom and able to fit a good number of 
arrows. A dark dye has been applied to the open mouth, creating 
a black streaking design that fades back into the natural brown 
as it goes down along the tube. Rows of yellowing claws have 
been set along the mouth and bottom, their pointed tips digging 
harmlessly into the leather, while two sets of larger, dulled 
claws dangle from leather thongs, enabling the quiver to be tied 
to a belt and the leg of the wearer.

a wild, chaotic pattern.

made out of a single piece of sturdy wood. Two leather loops at 
the back have been secured with metal studs, angled and spaced to 
support proper grip. The light wood has been treated with a 
darker stain on front and back, and the most notable feature is 
the design on the face of the shield. Etched and filled with 
black paint, a single wing spreads across the curved surface, 
each intricate feather detailed with care. Chips and scars mark 
the shield, yet the design is clearly visible through the wear.

A fraying length of warm, $drabcolor wool stretches on the ground.~
   The surprisingly soft weave of this $drabcolor wool fabric is 
nothing more than an unevenly shaped rectangle. The cloth is 
obviously of a homespun make, having nubs and knots throughout, 
but it still offers the warmth of regular wool. The edges appear 
to be fraying or fringed, many of the hanging edges knotted off 
to form a sloppy trim. It is large enough to serve as a cloak, a 
covering over the body, or tied about the waist to trap over the 
legs. It could even serve as a blanket for sleeping.

a scarf-swathed full-helm with a steel-mask visor~
A scarf-swathed full-helm with a steel mask visor lies here.~
   Forged from well-tempered, darkened steel, this full helm 
appears to have been fairly well-crafted. The skull of the helm 
has been made spherical, connecting to the side-panels with 
sturdy iron rivets, covering the sides of the head, back of the 
head and upper neck. A polished steel mask has been placed 
within the opening that reveals the wearers forehead to their 
chin. Slanted eyeholes have been fashioned into the mask to 
allow the wearer vision, and a thin opening across the mouth 
offers a more comfortable breathing space. The mask has been 
crafted to resemble a featureless, stony visage, offering 
protection to the face and giving an eerie appearance. The mask 
acts as a visor on the helm, able to be pushed up after being 
unlatched. A thick, onyx-hued scarf has been swathed over the 
back, sides and top of the helm, leaving the mask visible while 
hiding the rest of the helm.

the cheeks from harm and offer protection to the eyes, which are 
allowed a good view from wide, sharply-edged holes. Down the 
center of the helm is an exposed line that extends to the middle 
of the wearer's mouth, the nose protected by a

   Fine silver rivets, lined by a thin sliver of gold around the

masterful protection to the shoulders from downward strikes. A

an exquisite brigandine vest marked with a golden viper~
An exquisite brigandine vest marked with a golden viper is here~
   Fine silver rivets, lined by a thin sliver of gold around the 
boundary of each one, are set in organised diamond patterns 
slightly overlapping one another across this exquisitely crafted 
brigandine vest. A layer of fine polished steel plates lie 
beneath the rivets, two heavy banded pauldrons that have the 
print of a golden viper etched into them, while also providing 
masterful protection to the shoulders from downward strikes. A 
mirrored plate has been riveted over the vest's left breast to 
protect the heart. The plate is made of shiny silver plated 
steel, with a Viper engraved in gold onto it.

   This infant is graced with wispy tendrils of thick, jet black 
hair which tends to lay where it wills, despite attempts to tame 
the short tresses. Her face bears a delicate button nose and 
soulful brown eyes fraught with a multitude of inky eyelashes 
with pink lips and plump, rosy cheeks that give color to honey 
brown skin.

a large oval shield lined with spikes~
A large oval shield lined with spikes lays here forgotten.~
   This oval shield stands nearly five feet tall, its steel thick 
and well-forged. The outer rim of this solid plate's face is 
adorned with an inch-wide band of bronze, contrasting its 
blackened surface. The edge of the shield is lined with stubby, 
blackened spikes, each of them protruding out just a few inches. 
The broad, concave surface of the shield is emblazoned with a 
large, closed fist. The fist is depicted entirely in bronze, 
with eight long, spindly legs escaping its crushing grip. The 
shield is affixed with a handle on its backside, as well as a 
pair of straps to sling it over one's shoulder. Also notable on 
the shields backing is a small etching of a heater shield with 
two hammers crossed over its surface.

a human-face-visored, steel full-helm~
A shiny steel helm with visor fashioned in the likeness of a human face is here.~
   Covering the entirety of its wearers head, this imposing full 
helm resembles a humanoid's face. The top, back, and aventail of 
the helm is manipulated to resemble long hair falling to the 
shoulders. A slightly pointed ear protrudes from the right side 
whilst its counterpart is nothing but a stump. Surface 
skillfully worked, the faceplate portrays a near middle-aged man, 
lowered eyebrows, strong jawline and firm cheekbones lending him 
a gruff appearance whilst several other traits hint at his mixed, 
yrkin heritage. Although aesthetically pleasing, it has been 
well-forged out of high quality steel and appears more than 
suitable for the rigors of combat.

only for two strappings of leather, which serve as grip. The 
blade at the end is wider than one would expect and flat like a 
paddle, tapering to a lethal looking point. Woodpidgeon feathers 
decorate the joining of shaft to blade.

highly-polished, steel. A single band adorns the circumference 
of the helm with bronze rivets for decoration. Below this band 
has been crafted to appear like a face, sinister and 
intimidating. The brows, cheekbones and chin have all been made 
prominent and the smile has been molded into a menacing sneer. 
The eyes have been cut out to see through, and there is a grill 
where the teeth should be, to breath through. The metal 
continues from the mask, wrapping protectively around the neck.

a leather-taselled steel poleaxe~
A poleaxe with sand-hued leather tassels has been left here.~
   The shaft of this weapon reaches to near six feet in length, 
the wood dark and smooth. From tip to base carvings have been 
intricately engraved, scenes of desert wildlife, from scorpions 
to lions, though most predominant is the cobra snake. Leather 
the colour of sand has been wrapped in two places upon this 
shaft, obviously for gripping purposes and some thongs have been 
left loose, hanging like tassels over the hands of the wielder. 
Small shards of bone and rocks have been affixed to these loose 
tassels. The blade, wide and curving like a crescent moon, has a 
vicious looking edge - clearly supposed to be used as a chopping 
weapon, though its point is sharpened for thrusts as well. The 
steel has been roughly burnished, so that the reflection of light 
is less harsh off the blade. Leather tassels, affixed with large 
cat-like claws, hang from the top of the shaft for a purely 
aesthetic purpose.

An iron-bladed polearm with sand-hued leather tassels lies here.~
   The shaft of this weapon reaches to just over five feet in 
length, the wood dark and smooth. The shaft is unadorned save a 
carving of a cobra snake and a crescent moon, either side of the 
top of the pole, near the sweeping blade. Leather the colour of 
sand has been wrapped in two places upon the shaft, obviously for 
gripping purposes and some thongs have been left unwrapped but 
still attached, dangling over the hands of the wielder. These 
tassels have shards of bone attached to them, giving the weapon a 
rough look. The blade curves like a crescent moon, though it 
sweeps and tapers to a sharp point, indicating the main damage 
from this weapon comes from thrusting. The edge of the blade, 
however, is still sharpened and likely quite dangerous. The iron 
has been burnished so that the reflection of light is less harsh. 
Sand coloured leather tassels such as those on the handle have 
been attached on the join of the blade to the shaft as well, more 
bones adorning them for aesthetics.

   This helm has been wrapped in a coarse sand-hued linen, 
concealing the identity of the wearer when drawn across the face. 
Through the folds of the material a dull steel is seen, and the 
long noseguard confirms this when the linen is not drawn across 
the face. Cheek guards frame the wearer's face in a heart shape, 
flaring out off the face as they reach the jawline and then 
sweeping back just below the join of neck to head, although 
dipping a bit at the back of the neck. There is a small hook on 
a loose fold of linen by the face and an eye on the other side to 
secure it.

   Made of gleaming golden-toned bronze, this helm is a sturdy, 
well-designed piece of armor. Formed in a rounded-conical shape,

Etched into the surface of the helm is a scarlet serpent, winding 
in painstaking detail around the entire helm into a striking pose

neck and under the chin in finely crafted rings.

crosshatched detail, snake-like scales have been etched in a 
subtle pattern.

their surface, giving a snakeskin-like appearance.

A fingerless pair of bronze-scaled gloves has been left here.~
   These leather gloves have been covered in finely wrought 
bronze scales, left dull and unpolished. Made to ward off blows

the first knuckle, allowing for far greater dexterity. The 
scales are skilfully etched with lines forming smaller scales on 
their surface, giving a snakeskin-like appearance.

opposite the blade like the talon of some maligned bird of prey.
Iron langets stretch down the haft of the weapon to leather,
cord-wrapped grips providing added heft and durability.

The composite of this glaive's steel gives it a lusterless black
hue, its surface blackened and consuming all light cast upon it.
Attached without fault to a leather-wrapped haft, cruel barbs
adorn one side of the curving blade like the spikes on a
Stickleback fish. Most deadly, even more than the barbs, is the
full length of the blade's primary side: nearly a foot in length,
it is fashioned into a razor sharp edge that curves backward at
the point, capable of rending even the thickest armour.

of a pole, this voulge is of crude but functional worksmanship.
The dark wooden haft is six feet in length, slightly oily to the
touch, with an iron cap hammered onto the base. The blade is
pitted and scarred, covered in the faint sheen of grease, and has
been attatched with several bands of metal bound so tightly that
they dig into the wood. The foot and a half of iron has been
ground back to a sharp cutting edge, and curves to a viciously
pointed tip.

A steel scimitar with a falcon head pommel and winged crossguard lies here.~
   This scimitar appears to have been crafted by a skillful hand, 
each piece forged of steel and well polished. Along its curved 
blade runs a deep fuller and an engraving of a vicious lion 
graces each side, the beast bearing its fangs in an angry roar. 
Shaped like a pair of spread, feathered wings, the crossguard 
curls lightly towards the blade. Its hilt is wrapped firmly with 
leather cording, appearing to have been dyed with blood, rusty 
red in color. Its capped off with a firm steel pommel in the 
form of a falcon's head, its features worked in high relief. The 
careful eye might spy a small smiths mark on each metal piece, 
depicting a roaring flame. Aside from the visual details, its 
excellent balance, razor sharp edge and high quality materials 
make this a fine weapon of war.

   This brutal weapon is of a simple, yet stout design, great 
care taken in its making. Its dark oaken shaft is wrapped in 
leather to provide a firm grip and its other end is capped off 
with a steel band. Finely engraved in a scrolling fashion is a 
prancing horse, flanked by a graceful, swirling pattern. 
Attached to the band is a sturdy steel chain of two hands length 
which in turn is connected to a wickedly flanged head, crafted 
from solid steel and appearing capable of delivering brutal 
strikes. Each metal piece bears a small mark of a roaring flame, 
trace left by its maker. Its solid construction and high quality 
steel hint at a master's hand.

evidently the yield from the work of a master, which seem etched 
on the blue steel of this forward curving blade. About three 
feet in length, the single edge of this blade was made to keep a 
flawlessly keen cutting edge, able to cut through flesh and light 
armor with near impunity. Lacking a guard, the double lobed hilt 
of this sword is of the finest dark ivory, unblemished and with 
silver inlay along the top and bottom edges.

A spray of bright red feathers and beads is here~
   Designed to be worn about the wrist or ankle, this 
extravagantly showy piece is a leather strap onto which many 
feathers, dyed bright red, have been attached. Protruding out 
from the piece in every direction, the feathers create a 
magnificent display on their own. However, a great many leather 
thongs, threaded with brightly painted clay beads have also been 
attached, creating a rhythmic clacking with every move of the 
wearer.

   A pair of elongated, octagonal bronze plates affix to the 
wearers thighs, fastened by strips of dusty red wool, which are 
tied under the thighs. The plates cover from the top of the 
thigh, down to just above the knee, and are completely 
unpolished, and unadorned. Simple in design, they seem to offer 
very good protection of the thighs, and the quality is superb.

A short-hafted spear, topped with a jagged ivory tip is here.~
   The short, oak-haft of this spear is wrapped with supple, 
tanned leather, dyed to a color of rust. It is finely made, and 
leads to a sharpened, ivory tip, shaped into a long arrow-head, 
except the edges are serrated to keen points. Although this 
spear is simple in design, in the hands of an experienced user, 
it could be extremely deadly.

A magnificent feathered headdress of bronze has been left here.~
   This headdress is made of bronze, formed into the shape of a 
lions head, with rough cut rubies for eyes and it's mouth open in 
a roar. Instead of a mane, it is adorned with many hundreds of 
feathers which descend a good way down the wearers back. Dyed in 
a vast array of colours, from earthen brown to the brightest 
scarlet they provide a truly dazzling display. Of exquisite 
workmanship, the piece looks rather heavy, and is held on top of 
the head by a leather chin strap.

head reared up in the very center, displaying exceptional and 
ominous detail with its fanged, open maw.

A smooth-stone is lying in the dirt, something etched onto one side of it.~
   This smooth-stone is thin, and perfectly circular in shape. 
The rock seems to be rare, perhaps unknown, and has been smoothed 
on both sides whether through time or through process is hard to 
determine. Upon one side of it, a single vertical line has been 
etched perfectly into the ancient stone, one of horizontal nature 
crossing over it so that the lines meet perfectly in the center 
of the stone. Specks of blue, and ivory can be seen glistening 
in the grey stone itself, and the origin of it is hard to 
determine.

   This arrow is of average length; its dark, cherry-wood shaft 
roughly a yard in length. The head of the arrow, made from 
dulled steel, is broad and slightly barbed just below the razor 
sharp tip. The feather flights, dyed a deep indigo colour, 
spiral slightly around the base of the shaft, a design which 
allows the arrow to turn in flight, adding to accuracy and range. 
Upon the head of the arrow a lions claw has been engraved.

A razor-sharp, smooth-bladed yatagan lies here, the polished steel shining.~
   The blade of this yatagan curves slightly inwards, the inner 
side of the blade sharpened to a razor-sharp edge. The 
three-foot slender blade tapers smoothly to a viciously sharp 
point, a hollow groove running from hilt to tip. The polished 
steel is of the highest quality; light and hardy. Upon one side 
of the blade by the hilt a lion's claw has been etched in bronze, 
upon the other side sits an owl. The hilt has been made of 
ivory, intricate spiral patterns carved into it with skill, and 
it curves slightly inwards, like the blade. A talon shaped 
pommel has been attached to the end of the hilt to counterweight 
the blade, curving back in towards the hilt. The weight is such 
that this weapon would be easily used in defence as well as 
offence.

decadantly carved with the image of a terrible, winged serpent. 
The beast is highlighted with masterfully worked gold inlay and 
studded in placed with several small pieces of $gemcolor, adding 
to the brazen opulence of the piece while also assisting in 
providing a sound grip. The blade of this weapon is of 
master-forged watery steel, sharpened to a razor edge. Extending 
for just under a foot from the head of the shaft it's surface is 
perfectly smooth and wonderfully lustrous, though a distinctive, 
swirling grain pattern is visible within the metal itself.

an expressionless mask of unpolished bronze~
An expressionless mask made of unpolished bronze is here.~
   Made of solid, unpolished bronze, this mask is in the shape of 
a human face, lacking much detail at all. The holes for the eyes 
are somewhat slanted, and are jutted out just slightly to shadow 
the wearer's eyes beneath. The nose would hardly be considered 
one at all, and is simply rounded out to provide room underneath. 
The mouth is nothing but a three inch slit in the bronze itself, 
and the rest of the mask has no human attributes at all. The 
mask covers the entirety of the wearer's face, and wraps 
partially around the sides of the head. Affixed to the edges of 
the mask are knotted, leather cords, used to tie it around the 
back of the head.

a black-bladed, double-edged broadsword~
A double-edged broadsword with a black blade lies here in the dirt.~
   The black blade of this sword is made from iron of the highest 
quality, and has been polished to a glossy sheen. Thicker than 
most longswords, the blade itself has been sharpened on both 
sides, leaving each edge extremely sharp. The blackened, almost 
rectangular blade has been affixed to a large hilt that gives 
room for two hands if needed. The hilt has been wrapped in 
supple, black leather that perhaps cushions the force of a strike 
or parry on the wielders hands. Two inches from the bottom of 
the hilt, a double-edged spike has been embedded into it, the 
spike made of solid bronze. The crossguard of the blade is made 
of the same bronze, and both the spike and guard have been left 
unpolished. The tip of the blade has been honed to a keen point, 
and tops off the rather rectangular blade in the form of a 
triangle.

serpents of the arid desert, the diamond-shaped scales 
alternating between light and dark colors and almost perfectly 
matching the effect of rippling sand. Whilst the material is 
coarse on the outside the side nearest the body has been lined 
with suede, also serving to strengthen the sash.

$finecolor silk, though a golden pattern of stars and crescent 
moons runs along the hems, both top and bottom. No actual 
sleeves adorn the bodice, though the extra fabric along the 
shoulders has been sewn so that it crumples slightly, rising out 
slightly from the rest of the fabric, a star embroidered on the 
point of each crumple.

quality but with beauty that can only be described as 
incomparable. The etchings on the handle, although small, 
clearly depict a pattern of crescent moons and bright stars 
spiralling down to the base of the hilt. The blade itself has 
been kept to a high sheen and razor keen edge.

burnished blade has been carefully maintained and polished, with 
no rust along the blade at any point. The hilt has been wrapped 
in leather in a criss-crossing pattern to allow for a better 
grip. Long, $color tassles flow freely from a small metal loop 
that is attached to the end of the hilt.
