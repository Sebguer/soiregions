Lond Anorien Between Gates and Buildings~
   This section of the road has a sturdy wooden gate at each end, 
blocking travel along the Lond north and south, and sturdy 
buildings on either side east and west, creating a boxed effect. 
Both gates are well-reinforced with iron, particularly the 
northern one. The flanking buildings are constructed of logs, 
and heavy doors are set into the north end of each. Between the 
upper levels of the flanking buildings there is a covered wooden 
walkway - a bridge of sorts - which overlooks this section of 
road and the area to the north. 
   To the south, where it enters the township, it passes 
underneath the arch of a tall wooden gate, bearing letters in the 
Tengwar script.

Lond Anorien, Heading North and South~
   Lond Anorien, the great highway that traverses the southern 
length of the esteemed Fiefdom of Gondor that bears the same 
name, stretches on here to the north and south. The road itself 
has been well preserved in spite of many years of use and toil, 
the rectangular, whitewashed cobbles that form its surface only 
slightly worn about the edges. To the west of the highway, 
rock-strewn plains can be spied, ending at a line of trees that 
mark the distant horizon. To the east lie the extensive 
grasslands of the Fiefdom, gently undulating with the bend of the 
landscape, crossed by a network of pathways and dotted by the 
occasional thatched structure. 
   To the south a large building blocks the entrance into the 
township of Milton. A large iron-banded gate normally remains 
open but is closed in times of emergency.

On the Winding Lond Anorien, East of an Escarpment~
   The white-cobbled highway of Lond Anorien curves here, 
skirting the edge of a low, rocky escarpment to the west, and a 
steep hill to the east. The frowning face of the rocky ridge 
nearby casts a shadow over the roadside in the daytime, the 
craggy grey stone overtaken by brown lichens and green moss. To 
the east, around the bend of the hill, the fields of Anorien 
stretch on extensively, ending to the southeast at a tributary 
that can be spied at a higher vantage along the roadway. To the 
southwest the high mountain of Mindolluin rises, flanked by the 
stony foothills that gather at its base. Occasionally a 
traveller can be seen traversing the roadway, or camping by the 
wayside.

Lond Anorien, Bending West and South~
   Coursing its way through the vast countryside of Anorien, one 
of the northernmost provinces of Gondor, this road keeps for the 
most part to a straight course. Small villages and hamlets, 
cultivated fields, and herds of livestock are all passed by the 
road at sporadic intervals to the north and east. Grainy white 
stone constitutes most of the path, wide enough to bear two 
carriges, yet grey and black stones are not uncommon, and every 
now and again a pothole can be seen in the road. 
   The road continues on to the west, where it broadens a little 
before meeting the edge of the woodland known as the Grey Wood. 
From there it continues northward, becoming the Great West Road 
that stretches on throughout the rest of Anorien.

Anorien Fields, North and East of a Junction~
   Woody shrubs of dogwood dot the surrounding region, bristling 
with slender branches and crowned with garlands of pale white 
petals in spring. A thick coat of tall grass, ranging in colour 
from deep green to pale yellow, tufts the fields here in every 
direction. A number of small, well-managed orchards grow in 
narrow allotments in the distance, flanked on all sides by high, 
brambly hedges. Low, broad hillocks add a depth to this 
otherwise flat stretch of countryside, rising and falling in 
gentle waves across the terrain. Wild trees grow in sparse 
copses over the land, few in number. 
   A junction of two broad roads lies to the southwest, difficult 
to miss from the right vantage.

Crossing Anorien's Healthy Farmlands, East of a Highway~
   Rows of heather grow alongside a variety of other herbs and 
vegetation here, often bristling with crowns of lavender flowers. 
Thin clusters of trees grow in small, sparse thickets about the 
region here, plain in sight. Large cultivated crofts divide 
portions of the surrounding countryside into segments, bordered 
by high wooden fences. The fields here, though bare and bleak in 
the depths of winter, are a tapestry of many colours in the 
summer and spring, speckled with wildflowers and other blooming 
flora. In farms that pepper the landscape, barley, wheat and 
other grain crops are sown, planted in narrow allotments. 
   To the north, east, and south the farmlands stretch forth. To 
the west, they stop at the eastern border of the Lond Anorien.

Due East of Lond Anorien, in Ranging Fields~
   Thick patches of clover grow in abundance here amongst the 
tall grass of the encircling fields. The higher ground here 
offers a wide and breathtaking view of bordering fields, which 
stretch on for a great distance. Over a great expanse, broad 
hills gently rise and fall here, lending the terrain a gradual 
depth. Small shrubs and a variety of woody vegetation sprinkle 
the region, growing in close thickets over the flatland. Lengthy 
rows of wheat and barely grow tenaciously in the tilled plots of 
nearby farms, bobbing in the wind. 
   Halting the westward spread of the plains here is the broad 
Lond Anorien, plainly visible on the horizon.

Amidst Broad Fields on the Western Fringes of Anorien~
   The dark soil of the land here is plainly arable and largely 
pure, bearing only a sparse scattering of white-flecked pebbles 
and other detritus. Where fully exposed, the grassy stalks of 
the surrounding countryside quiver and rustle with every stiff 
gust of wind. The horizon is dotted sporadically with scanty 
trees, their twisted boughs lifted high above the field line. 
Now and then, the terrain here folds gently into long, broad 
hills, ringed with a stunning array of vegetation. Houses, 
barns, and other wooden structures freckle the surrounding 
grassland, plainly visible from the proper vantage. 
   The fields press on in every direction here, save to the west, 
where a long cobbled road runs north to south.

Extensive Anorien Countryside, East of a Road~
   A variety of wild herbs, from cowslip to sorrel, prosper here 
in the dank, fertile soil of the grassland. Sown into the 
well-tended farmland nearby are ranks of oats and barley, growing 
bountifully throughout the summer with the proper attention. 
Rough sheets of granite and limestone occasionally crest the lush 
meadow turf of this region, weeds crawling over their exposed 
stony surfaces. Herbaceous milkwort bushes thrive in the grassy 
landscape alongside other vegetation here, blooming purple in 
most months of the year. Fenced rectangular plots litter the 
tamer corners of the encircling grassland, tended and tilled by 
resident farmers. 
   The Lond Anorien is plainly spied to the west, bringing an end 
to the grassland's breadth.

Grassy Green Plains of Anorien~
   Woody bushes of boxthorn, scraggy and bleak in the winter and 
laden with plump red berries in spring, pepper the encircling 
grassland. Thick swathes of weedy grass carpet the landscape 
here, growing dense and tight in the fertile soil underfoot. 
Little farms spring up at random here, regularly tended by the 
inhabitants throughout the year, and bordered by low, knotted 
fences. Long, wide stretches of the grassland here are perfectly 
flat, offering an excellent, unobscured view of the encompassing 
region. Human feet have trod a network of paths through the 
fields, the sodden passages weaving off toward distant buildings 
and small, tilled meadows.

Scrubby Anorien Fields at the Base of Mount Mindolluin~
   The landscape teems with a vast array of high, reedy grasses, 
prospering in the rich soil of the countryside. The dark earth 
of the encircling fieldland is replete with scraggly weeds and 
tall bushes. Small wooden structures have been erected on 
privately-owned tofts across the fields, ringed with tended 
hedges. Cows, sheep and other tame livestock roam the pastures 
here in daylight, often guided by herdsmen who linger not far 
behind. Rolling gently, broad hillocks climb and fall across the 
surrounding fields regularly. 
   The terrain grows increasingly rugged and scrubby to the west 
and south, where it slopes sharply into rocky hills. To the 
north the fields press on gently, while to the east they meet the 
western fringes of the Lond Anorien, with a large building
blocking further movement from where it sits just north of
the township of Milton.

Between the Grey Wood and Lond Anorien, in Rock-Strewn Plains~
   Tall hawthorns, bristling with thorny branches and pale green 
foliage, bloom with spotted white flowers across the grassland 
here in fairer seasons. The land here is cloaked in a dense 
carpet of grasses, ranging variously in type and colour. On 
occasion the encompassing fieldland is grooved with low, craggy 
escarpments, their sloped limestone faces overrun with growth. 
Few wild trees grow in the surrounding grassland, but those that 
do, though usually spare and thin, are easy to spot. Dirt paths 
are beaten across the ground here in a haphazard network, pounded 
and furrowed with telltale signs of the passing of human traffic. 
   The fields here end to the west and east, meeting the Grey 
Wood in the former direction, and the Lond Anorien in the latter.

On Low, Grassy Escarpments, South of a Junction~
   Human feet have trod a network of paths through the fields, 
the sodden passages weaving off toward distant buildings and 
small, tilled meadows. Woody bushes of boxthorn, scraggy and 
bleak in the winter and laden with plump red berries in spring, 
pepper the encircling grassland. The occasional finger of 
granite or limestone peeks above the surface of the grassy earth, 
running in short ridges about the fields. Long, wide stretches 
of the grassland here are perfectly flat, offering an excellent, 
unobscured view of the encompassing region. Thick swathes of 
weedy grass carpet the landscape here, growing dense and tight in 
the fertile soil underfoot. 
   To the west a great birch wood stands, while a junction of 
roads lies to the north. To the east the Lond Anorien runs 
parallel to the fields here.

The Great West Road, Merging With Lond Anorien~
   The occasional tree has found purchase near the curbs of the 
road below, slender roots upturning the tiles that lie adjacent. 
Though speckled with grime, the limestone of the thoroughfare 
here still glistens bright in sunlight or moonlight, especially 
after a recent rain. From the right vantage, the blue-grey peaks 
of the White Mountains can be distantly spied to the south, 
mounting high above the horizon. Low, square-columned milestones 
of marble flank the road here at regular intervals, their 
surfaces lightly etched with tengwar inscriptions, now largely 
faded. To the northeast extensive fields of many grasses range, 
visible from nearly any point on this portion of the highway. 
   The road presses on to the north. To the east, where it 
bends, it merges with Lond Anorien.

The Great West Road Running North and South~
   From some of the higher bends of the Great West Road, one can 
spot the magnificent White Mountains in the distant the south, 
clawing upward in a craggy line. A few of the flagstones below 
are flecked with mud, their exteriors seemingly permanently 
stained by an infusion of grime. The heavens, clearly visible 
from this stretch of the broad roadway, extend high above. 
Small, weedy clusters of vegetation have begun to poke through 
some of the wider the gaps in this stretch of road. The highway 
here is wide and unobstructed, save for the infrequent fallen 
tree. 
   Anorien fields unfurl to the east, while westward lies the 
thick of the Grey Wood.

The Great West Road, Bordering the Grey Wood~
   The road here bends and swells with the rise and fall of the 
surrounding terrain. Black marble milestones can be spied at 
regular intervals on either side of the thoroughfare, their bases 
overgrown with woody vegetation. A number of the tiles that 
compose this length of the Great West Road have been bleached 
bone white by the sun, lending a unique depth of hue to the 
highway. Curbs composed of fitted rectangular blocks have been 
driven into the earth on either side of the causeway here. 
Though remarkably well-preserved for its age, the roadway here 
nevertheless shows signs of deterioration, some of its flagstones 
tarnished and stained. 
   Bordering the roadway to the west, the Grey Wood lies, its 
slender birches plainly visible from here. Wide grasslands lie 
to the east.

The Great West Road Running Alongside the Grey Wood~
   Only a few travelers traverse the cobbled thoroughfare here, 
those that do appearing dusty and worn. Small, rounded grey 
cobblestones fill gaps in the highway underfoot, set into a 
tight, uniform pattern. The roadway here is surprisingly 
well-maintained, its surface only lightly marred by the impact of 
passing traffic. Long, rectangular blocks of heavy, roughly-hewn 
limestone curb either side of the progressing roadway. The sky 
unfolds majestically above the stretching causeway that lies 
below, unobstructed in view. 
   The road runs north to south, flanked to the east by Anorien 
fields, and to the west by a birch woodland.

The Great West Road, Stretching North and South~
   The roadway here weaves rises and falls at odd intervals, in 
accordance with the contours of the encircling landscape. The 
road here is constituted by a patchwork of cobbles and 
flagstones, their slightly rounded edges intersecting at tight 
angles to form a nearly flawless surface. Though the Great West 
Road is fairly well maintained, the odd flagstone here has 
fractured due to traffic or weather. Intermittently, a wagon or 
traveller passes by on the thoroughfare, sometimes accompanied by 
patrols of guardsmen from the local townships of northern 
Anorien. Fitted rectangular blocks flank either side of this 
wide highway, spotted with moss and lichen. 
   The beginnings of the Grey Wood lie in a westerly direction. 
To the east, broad fields range, while the causeway here 
continues to the north and south.

At a Turn in the Great West Road~
   The intermittent traveller can be spied crossing the road here 
infrequently, often arriving from lesser paths and arteries that 
intersect with the main highway. Cobblestones of an ashen shade 
occupy narrow rifts in the otherwise unbroken surface of the 
Great West Road, their contours rounded, and a bit worn. In the 
slender earthen lines that divide the limestone tiles of the 
sprawling roadway small tufts of weedy grasses are beginning to 
grow. Passing wagons have driven shallow ruts into the tiles 
below, which fill often with water in the wetter seasons of the 
year. The faces of some of the flagstones of the thoroughfare 
here are speckled with lichen, others spotted with patches of 
grey-green moss. 
   The road turns a bit sharply here, coursing from west to 
south.

Northeast of a Bending Great West Road, in Anorien~
   The dark earth of the encircling fieldland is replete with 
scraggly weeds and tall bushes. Small wooden structures have 
been erected on privately-owned tofts across the fields, ringed 
with tended hedges. The terrain here is lined with bony ribs of 
limestone that crest the earth underfoot at odd intervals, strewn 
with mosses and shrubs. The sky unfolds above in a great dome, 
clear in view from the wide flats and gentle slopes of the 
encompassing grassland below. The landscape teems with a vast 
array of high, reedy grasses, prospering in the rich soil of the 
countryside. 
   The fields here disperse to the south and west, stopping at 
the edges of a sharply turning road.

On a Series of Rolling Hills~
   A series of rough hills rise and fall here in quick 
succession, climbing steeply before plunging down into low, 
grass-filled gullies. The highland ground is rocky and bare, 
growing only more bleak as it rolls sharply southward. The hills 
here are composed of hard earth, only loosely spotted with green 
growth, ribs of ridged granite and dry limestone folded in with 
the grainy soil. On any of the higher hills here, the Grey Wood 
can be spied to the north, spreading outward in that direction 
for several leagues. Southward, a narrow valley known as the 
Stonewain separates these hills from others that flank the base 
of Mount Mindolluin. To the east a small cluster of buildings 
can be spied on the shores of a glassy river, the waterway 
cutting a path through endless Anorien fields.

The Edge of the Grey Wood, at the Base of Foothills~
   The numerous birches here, sheathed in grey-white bark, are 
spotted with black knots, pale brown whorls, and other signs of 
age. The floor of the wood here is often blanketed by a carpet 
of loose leaves, twigs and bark, all in various stages of 
decomposition. The crisp, invigorating air of the thicket here 
occasionally carries muted sounds of the resident fauna; the 
rustling of underbrush and the calls of birds can be heard often. 
Intermittently, a fallen tree trunk or bough, overrun by pale 
moss and fungus, obstructs one's movement here. The lofty birch 
trees of the Grey Wood creak and groan with every strong gust of 
wind, their slender branches, closely intersecting above, 
rattling as they touch. 
   Rock-strewn plains lie to the east, the forest thinning 
significantly in that direction. To the south the ground slopes 
upward, meeting the base of a series of high hills.

The Edge of the Grey Wood~
   Narrow, unearthed roots enmesh the earth below in a sinuous 
tapestry, most overrun by the substantial undergrowth of the 
encompassing wood. A loose carpet of debris has been mixed in 
with the underbrush here, supple twigs and curled fallen leaves 
padding one's steps. Clusters of wildflowers dot the underbrush 
here in warmer seasons, but lie withered and pale in the year's 
colder months. The surrounding terrain, though varying greatly 
in depth, follows a general rise to the south, where the Grey 
Wood thickens before reaching the sheer bases of Mount Mindolluin 
and its sister peaks. A canopy of narrow boughs rises overhead, 
crowned with leafy garlands of bright green in the summer and 
spring, and festooned with red and gold foliage in the fall. 
   The woodland grows rather sparse to the east, where it meets 
grassy fields atop an escarpment. It presses on unhindered to 
the south, west and north.

The Grey Wood Nearing the Great West Road~
   The atmosphere in this stretch of woodland is open, crisp and 
unoppressive. Numerous trees, mostly grey birches, rise up high 
overhead, their slender roots, occasionally unearthed, 
crisscrossing below. An assortment of vegetation, from clover to 
fern, thickly populates the woodland ground, hugging the trunks 
of trees and climbing its way across the uneven earth. Small 
twigs lay scattered about the floor of the woodland here during 
most seasons, mixed in with other heavy brush. The ground rises 
and falls here in gentle undulations, adding depth to the forest 
floor, and resulting in occasional ridges or tree-spotted hills. 
   The Grey Wood stretches on in all directions here, save to the

The Edge of the Grey Wood, Near the Great West Road~
   Black soil lies underfoot here, fertile but firm, and held 
tight by the roots of the woodland flora. The birches here are 
arrayed in disparate ranks like tall sentinels, their slim white 
forms visible in nearly every direction. Though healthy, the 
encircling woodland is somewhat sparse, lending the atmosphere an 
airy, spacious ambience. In the distance to the south, visible 
through gaps in the dome of the woodland, the jagged White 
Mountains rise, the bulky form of Mindolluin capped with a halo 
of frost. The numerous birches here, sheathed in grey-white 
bark, are spotted with black knots, pale brown whorls, and other 
signs of age. 
   The Great West Road borders the woodland here in the eastern 
distance, while the forest presses on in all other directions.

Nearing the Great West Road in the Grey Wood~
   Wild, herbaceous shrubs and bushes, from hawthorn to wormwood, 
grow thickly below the treeline, well fed by fertile earth and 
thriving in the open air of the Grey Wood. The horizon here is 
dominated by a web of pale white and grey birches, each tree 
rising above the woodland floor like a slender spike of silver. 
The landscape here is folded, sagging into shallow gullies before 
rising again into low, tree-spotted escarpments. The dense soil 
underfoot is pure, black and fecund, teeming with woody 
vegetation. Narrow, unearthed roots enmesh the earth below in a 
sinuous tapestry, most overrun by the substantial undergrowth of 
the encompassing wood. 
   The Grey Wood stretches on to the north, west, and south. To 
the east a road can be spied, bringing an abrupt end to the 
woodland's breadth.

The Northeastern Edge of the Grey Wood~
   The birches that preponderate here are lithe and willowy in 
form, their narrow branches and wider trunks seeming quite 
pliant. Up above, the sky can clearly be spied through the 
ceiling of the woodland, webbed with slim branches. Throughout 
most months of the year, broad, edged leaves of differing shades 
hang from the drooping branches of the encircling trees, 
interwoven to form a high, open woodland canopy. The hard earth 
of the ground underfoot is densely packed, anchored fast by the 
feet of the encircling trees. Moss and other lichen grow at the 
base of the trees here, whilst upward along their trunks sits 
bumpy, silver-white bark, peeling in some places and smooth in 
others. 
   To the west and east the woodland grows thin, a hill rising in 
the former direction, and a road appearing in the latter.

Beginnings of the Grey Wood, Near a Hill and a Road~
   The floor of the wood here is often blanketed by a carpet of 
loose leaves, twigs and bark, all in various stages of 
decomposition. The lofty birch trees of the Grey Wood creak and 
groan with every strong gust of wind, their slender branches, 
closely intersecting above, rattling as they touch. The crisp, 
invigorating air of the thicket here occasionally carries muted 
sounds of the resident fauna; the rustling of underbrush and the 
calls of birds can be heard often. The trees of the surrounding 
thicket occasionally thin into a small clearing, home to 
hollowed, rotted logs and wiry brush. Intermittently, a fallen 
tree trunk or bough obstructs one's movement here, overrun by 
pale moss and fungus. 
   To the north and east, the sparse woodland here thins quickly, 
approaching the edge of a broad road. A hill looms in the 
distance to the west, its rocky slope dominating the horizon in 
that direction.

The Winding Great West Road, East of Amon Din~
   Broad, irregular-edged flagstones comprise much the road that 
courses through this stretch of the countryside. Low, 
square-columned milestones of marble flank the road here at 
regular intervals, their surfaces lightly etched with tengwar 
inscriptions, now largely faded. To the northeast extensive 
fields of many grasses range, visible from nearly any point on 
this portion of the highway. The occasional tree has found 
purchase near the curbs of the road below, slender roots 
upturning the tiles that lie adjacent. Though predominantly 
straight, the wide Great West Road occasionally dips into long 
twists and bends, gently accommodating the shape of the 
surrounding countryside. 
   The road winds from the east to the north here, bordered to 
the west by the rocky slopes of Amon Din.

The Great West Road, Bending From West to South~
   A testament to Gondorian engineering, this stretch of the 
Great West road, though heavily aged, has nevertheless endured 
countless years of travel. Small, weedy clusters of vegetation 
have begun to poke through some of the wider the gaps in this 
stretch of road. The highway here is wide and unobstructed, save 
for the infrequent fallen tree. From some of the higher bends of 
the Great West Road, one can spot the magnificent White Mountains 
in the distant the south, clawing upward in a craggy line. The 
occasional grey or black cobble peeks out from amongst the white 
limestone of the course underfoot, a bit jarring to the eye. 
   The road bends weaves gently here, northwest to southeast. A 
hill lies immediately to the southwest, coming to a high peak.

Traversing Rolling Hills, North of a Narrow Valley~
   High hills range here for many strides, swelling above the 
landscape in great rolling waves. Moss and lichen swarms about 
the rough ridges of stone that comprise the bony highland, 
peppering the rock in swathes of bright colour. Many of the 
lower hills to the north are lightly forested, bearing traces of 
the Grey Wood's many silver birches. To the east and west the 
line of hills here presses on. To the south, the land flattens 
briefly in a thin, grassy valley before rising steadily and 
sharply once more, folding into high foothills as it approaches 
the bulky roots of Mount Mindolluin. Northward, the Grey Wood 
extends, the bend of the beacon hill of Amon Din cresting its 
treeline on the horizon.

By a Creek in the Grey Wood, Near Foothills to the South~
   Small twigs lay scattered about the floor of the woodland here 
during most seasons, mixed in with other heavy brush. Numerous 
trees, mostly grey birches, rise up high overhead, their slender 
roots, occasionally unearthed, crisscrossing below. The 
atmosphere in this stretch of the woodland is open, crisp and 
unoppressive. An assortment of vegetation, from clover to fern, 
thickly populates the woodland ground, hugging the trunks of 
trees and climbing their way across the uneven earth. The 
birches that preponderate here are lithe and willowy in form, 
their narrow branches and wider trunks seeming quite pliant. 
   As the land rises quickly to the south, a creek bubbles down 
the gradual slope of the woodland here, continuing on to the 
north.

of Mindolluin capped with a halo of frost. The numerous birches 
here, sheathed in grey-white bark, are spotted with black knots,

   A pool of muddy water sits in a basin of limestone in the 
midst of this stretch of the wood, fed by a bubbling creek that 
stretches on to the south. The Grey Wood presses on in all 
directions.

A Broad Clearing, Deep Within the Grey Wood~
   A loose carpet of debris has been mixed in with the underbrush 
here, supple twigs and curled fallen leaves padding ones step. A 
canopy of narrow boughs rises overhead, crowned with leafy 
garlands of bright green in the summer and spring, and festooned 
with red and gold foliage in the fall. Clusters of wildflowers 
dot the underbrush here in warmer seasons, but lie withered and 
pale in the years colder months. Peeling bark encases each of 
the many birches here, ranging from snow white to pale grey in 
hue. The surrounding terrain, though varying greatly in depth, 
follows a general rise to the south, where the Grey Wood thickens 
before reaching the sheer bases of Mount Mindolluin and its 
sister peaks. 
   An especially broad clearing unfolds here, flanked on all 
sides by the walls of the wood. A large, rough boulder of 
limestone sits at its centre, swept with moss and surrounded by a 
bed of tenacious weeds.

The Base of Amon Din, Rising Above the Woodland~
   The earth here slopes up into a gentle hillside, the ground 
growing bare as it gradually rises. The roots of the slope are 
grassy and moss-strewn, composed of tumbled stones and clods of 
pebble and clay-strewn soil. Ridges of bleak rock - stony teeth 
of black and grey - emerge from this haphazard mess at the 
slope's further, loftier reaches, piling upward toward the sky. 
The view from the treeless hillside is wide and uninhibited - 
the air clear, but somewhat thin. 
   Westward and northward slopes of a similar look run parallel 
to this one, coming to a peak to the northwest. Eastward lies a 
thin strip of the Grey Wood near the Great West Road, while to 
the south the Grey Wood extends for several leagues.

Upon the Slopes of Amon Din~
   Mounds of earth and many ribs of stone stack precipitously 
here to form the eastern base of Amon Din. Rough shelves are 
scraped into the craggy, weather-beaten boulders that comprise 
the hillside here, sprinkled with dusty soil that is held fast by 
the roots of a sparse collection of weedy vegetation. Blotchy 
lichen of orange and pale brown hues speckles the surfaces of 
some of the larger outlying overturned stones, thick in growth. 
The slope of the hillside is steep, growing only more severe as 
it continues its skyward climb. 
   A granite spur crowns the hill to the west, while to the north 
and south the base of Amon Din bends on. Eastward a broad road 
unfolds, lying east of the Grey Wood, and west of gently rolling 
cultivated fields that stretch on to the horizon.

The Sloped Base of Amon Din, Near a Road~
   Slabs and shelves of roughly worn rock have been piled to form 
the steep slope that unfolds here, the ancient, wind-scraped 
stones notched with crags and gullies. Some of the flatter 
shelves of the hillside are draped with reedy brown grasses and 
thorny vegetation, others spotted with low, gnarled trees of 
birch and pine. The pebbly earth underfoot is rather bleak and 
dusty, mostly devoid of colour and life. Though the slope is 
difficult to traverse, meandering paths may be picked from 
boulder to boulder to facilitate travel in any direction. 
   To the west, the terrain continues to climb until shortly 
reaching a stretch of smoother ground. To the south, a slope of 
similar height and composition rises, while northward and 
eastward the hillside is met by the fringes of a cobbled road.

The Great West Road, Near the Base of Amon Din~
   Thick flagstones of pale limestone have been fitted together 
to form the road underfoot, hammered firmly into the hard earth 
below. Curbs composed of fitted rectangular blocks have been 
driven into the earth on either side of the causeway here. 
Though remarkably well-preserved for its age, the roadway here 
nevertheless shows signs of deterioration, some of its flagstones 
tarnished and stained. The road here bends and swells with the 
rise and fall of the surrounding terrain. The road sags into the 
occasional depression here, small potholes trodden into the 
predominantly flat face of the highway by heavy traffic. 
   South and west of here, the base of a tall hill known as Amon 
Din slopes upward. The road stretches forth to the north and 
east.

South of the Grey Wood, on Rockbound Slopes~
   A chain of towering hills sweeps upward from the more even, 
woodland ground to the north here, stretching west to east in a 
solid line. The hilly ground is rocky, steep and almost 
mountainous, the hard, dry earth here supporting little in the 
way of vegetation. Craggy spines of stone crest the slopes here, 
marred and aged by the heavy, taxing blows of wind and weather, 
and speckled with sprays of dusty red and pale green lichen. A 
grassy, rock-strewn valley extends a short distance to the south, 
bringing a temporary end to the expansion of the hills here in 
that direction. Beyond the valley, the colossal form of 
Mindolluin rises, flanked by a series of high foothills.

The Sloped Base of Amon Din, Near Thinning Woodland~
   Emerging from the light depths of the Grey Wood below, the 
broad southern base of the mighty hill of Amon Din rises here. 
Swift travel, either up or down the quickly climbing slope, is 
made difficult by the hillside's unpredictable and roughly-cut 
form, the many shelves and slabs of heavy stone that comprise its 
bulk now piled in colossal steps, now slipping into sheer cliffs, 
now tumbling into pebble-filled gullies. Willowy birches blanket 
the lower reaches of the hill, crawling up its stony roots; a 
path has been rent through their collective mass by a sharp-edged 
boulder, evidence of a recent rockslide. 
   To the east the slope continues, while to the west and south 
it descends, merging gradually with the fringes of the Grey Wood. 
Northward looms a titanic ridge of granite - the highest point of 
towering Amon Din.

High Upon Amon Din~
   Looming above the countryside here at a great height, this 
bare spur of black-grey granite marks the highest point on the 
beacon hill of Amon Din. The solid mass of stone underfoot 
protrudes from the encircling slopes at a steep angle, emerging 
from the ground beneath like an antediluvian artifact disgorged 
from the very bowels of the earth. The view atop the ancient 
ridge is simply breathtaking: eastward and northward, the wide 
and gently rolling grasslands of Anorien unfold, webbed with 
cobbled paths and fenced farmsteads, and peppered with clusters 
of small edifices of stone and wood; southward, the Grey Wood 
ranges, its ranks of slender birches meeting the foothills of 
Mindolluin before long, their expanse halted by the titanic form 
of that towering mountain, which stands crowned with an 
everlasting wreath of murky fog; westward creeps the dark, 
evergreen immensity of the Druadan Forest, spreading for leagues 
in that direction. Far to the west, a grassy hill crests the 
Druadan's treeline, its form noticeably visible on the horizon. 
   In all directions the slopes of Amon Din descend from this 
point. Immediately to the west, the face of the heel of granite 
here grows sheer, falling vertically for a significant measure 
before reaching the base of the hill beyond.

On Roughly Even Slopes, North of the Summit of Amon Din~
   The land, though angling upward to the south, is roughly even 
here, the flinty soil underfoot hidden beneath a dense carpet of 
grass. Stunted spruce trees sporadically dot the terrain, 
growing only thinly at this altitude. To the north, west, and 
east the land slopes downward roughly, growing jagged and 
rockbound. Far to the west the seemingly impenetrable evergreen 
treeline of the Druadan Forest unfolds, stretching on for 
leagues. A massive shelf of rock, its craggy sides reaching a 
rounded cap, thrusts skyward to the south, dominating the horizon 
in that direction.

The Northern Base of Amon Din, Near the Great West Road~
   Ribbed with rough fingers of granite and limestone, the 
terrain here slopes up sharply to the south, the incline steep, 
but not precipitous enough to inhibit travel in that direction 
altogether. The ground underfoot is rocky and pebble-strewn, the 
sloping earth littered with stones of every size and shape. 
Though vegetation is sparse, the occasional pine tree or hawthorn 
bush can be spied on the hillside, clinging fast to the looser 
soil below. Swathes of grass also carpet the slope here in 
sparse, weedy patches. 
   The land continues to rise to the south. A narrow strip of 
farmed fields lie to the west, ending at at dark forest of 
evergreens. To the north and east the Great West Road winds.

In the Midst of Rocky Hills, Far North of Mindolluin~
   Rolling broadly, a series of rocky hills extend across the 
landscape here, flattening as they reach the fringes of a light 
woodland to the northeast. Loose pebbles and larger stones 
rounded by the weather lie scattered upon the highland ground 
here in great number. Thickets of slender trees encased in 
smooth, silver-grey bark sprout at the feet of a number of the 
slopes here, several small copses finding purchase even at higher 
altitudes. To the north, west and east the hilly terrain 
continues to extend. Southward snakes the narrow Stonewain 
valley, overgrown with weedy grasses and peppered with boulders 
and smaller stones. Mindolluin looms on the horizon beyond, 
bordered to the west by its lesser, sister peaks, and to the 
north by a line of steep foothills.

On Forested Hills, Southwest of the Grey Wood ~
   Gently sloped hills rise and fall gradually in a wide line 
here, their tops bare, rocky and windblown. The lower reaches of 
many of the hills here are blanketed with thickets of silver 
white birch trees, their slender forms growing less numerous at 
significant altitudes. West and south of here the hilly terrain 
continues in much the same fashion, ranging onward for a 
significant distance. To the north the landscape behaves in an 
opposite fashion, flattening gently until the hills here have 
completely smoothed, the Grey Wood dominating the countryside in 
that direction.

The Grey Wood, Nearing Mindolluin's Foothills~
   A canopy of narrow boughs rises overhead, crowned with leafy 
garlands of bright green in the summer and spring, and festooned 
with red and gold foliage in the fall. Clusters of wildflowers 
dot the underbrush here in warmer seasons, but lie withered and 
pale in the years colder months. Peeling bark encases each of 
the many birches here, ranging from snow white to pale grey in 
hue. Narrow, unearthed roots enmesh the earth below in a sinuous 
tapestry, most overrun by the substantial undergrowth of the 
encompassing wood. A loose carpet of debris has been mixed in 
with the underbrush here, supple twigs and curled fallen leaves 
padding ones step. 
   To the west and south the land slopes upward considerably, 
meeting with a stretch of foothills that flank the northern 
stretch of Mount Mindolluin.

The Western Edge of the Grey Wood~
   Moss and other lichen grow at the base of the trees here, 
whilst upward along their trunks sits bumpy, silver-white bark, 
peeling in some places and smooth in others. Throughout most 
months of the year, broad, edged leaves of differing shades hang 
from the drooping branches of the encircling trees, interwoven to 
form a high, open woodland canopy. The ground rises and falls 
here in gentle undulations, adding depth to the forest floor, and 
resulting in occasional ridges or tree-spotted hills. The 
birches that preponderate here are lithe and willowy in form, 
their narrow branches and wider trunks seeming quite pliant. Up 
above, the sky can clearly be spied through the ceiling of the 
woodland, webbed with slim branches. 
   The woodland opens out onto a broad field to the west, 
separating the Grey Wood from a much denser expanse of forest 
beyond.

The Western Fringe of the Grey Wood~
   The birches here are arrayed in disparate ranks like tall 
sentinels, their slim white forms visible in nearly every 
direction. The trees of the surrounding thicket occasionally 
thin into a small clearing, home to hollowed, rotted logs and 
wiry brush. The numerous birches here, sheathed in grey-white 
bark, are spotted with black knots, pale brown whorls, and other 
signs of age. The crisp, invigorating air of the thicket here 
occasionally carries muted sounds of the resident fauna; the 
rustling of underbrush and the calls of birds can be heard often. 
In the distance to the south, visible through gaps in the dome of 
the woodland, the jagged White Mountains rise, the bulky form of 
Mindolluin capped with a halo of frost. 
   A grassy field lies to the west, devoid of trees, another 
forest barely visible beyond it in that direction. To the north, 
east, and south the Grey Wood continues.

The Edge of the Grey Wood~
   The horizon here is dominated by a web of pale white and grey 
birches, each tree rising above the woodland floor like a slender 
spike of silver. Peeling bark encases each of the many birches 
here, ranging from snow white to pale grey in hue. Narrow, 
unearthed roots enmesh the earth below in a sinuous tapestry, 
most overrun by the substantial undergrowth of the encompassing 
wood. Clusters of wildflowers dot the underbrush here in warmer 
seasons, but lie withered and pale in the years colder months. 
The dense soil underfoot is pure, black and fecund, teeming with 
woody vegetation. 
   To the west, the woodland opens into a broad clearing, visible 
through graps in the encircling trees. The woodland continues in 
all other directions.

The Northwestern Edge of the Grey Wood~
   Numerous trees, mostly grey birches, rise up high overhead, 
their slender roots, occasionally unearthed, crisscrossing below. 
The ground rises and falls here in gentle undulations, adding 
depth to the forest floor, and resulting in occasional ridges or 
tree-spotted hills. The birches that preponderate here are lithe 
and willowy in form, their narrow branches and wider trunks 
seeming quite pliant. Throughout most months of the year, broad, 
edged leaves of differing shades hang from the drooping branches 
of the encircling trees, interwoven to form a high, open woodland 
canopy. An assortment of vegetation, from clover to fern, 
thickly populates the woodland ground, hugging the trunks of 
trees and climbing its way across the uneven earth. 
   The land slopes upward to the north and east, rising steadily. 
To the west, the woodland thins, while it grows denser to the 
south.

The Base of Amon Din, Sloping Upwards~
   Ringed with hoary, monstrous evergreens at lower altitudes, 
the base of a rock-strewn hill known in the land of Gondor as 
Amon Din mounts dramatically above the horizon here. Great 
ridges of granite stack and interweave to form the sloped, uneven 
terrain in this region, their surfaces seemingly roughened by the 
elements, and hard to the touch. What little soil is scattered 
across the small plateaus cut into the unfolding hillside seems 
thick and dry, akin to clay in composition, and sporting few 
signs of growth or fertility. 
   To the west and south the land steadily declines, swallowed up 
by the Grey Wood in the latter direction. Northward, another 
slope runs parallel to the one here, while eastward a massive 
spur of granite is driven up from the climbing earth, 
insurmountable from this location.

The Base of Amon Din, Near the Druadan Forest~
   Sparsely spotted with tall trees and woody brush, the 
landscape here begins a gradual eastward rise. Shelves of rock 
jut outward from the hard soil below, stacked one on top of the 
other to form the encompassing slope. Slabs of smooth white 
limestone and rough-surfaced granite protrude from the earth at 
odd angles, impeding swift travel. Much of the rock here is 
spotted with blotchy lichen of varying shades, from pale green to 
rust red. The ground underfoot, though supporting a few 
scattered patches of flora, is for the most part pebbly and 
dust-strewn. 
   To the south another slope rises, roughly equal in height, 
while to the east the terrain grows ever steeper. Westward, a 
brooding forest unfolds. Northward lie cultivated grasslands.

Between Amon Din and the Druadan Forest~
   Patches of bright-flowered goldenrod bloom here in warmer 
seasons, thriving in the open fieldland. The dark soil of the 
land here is plainly arable and largely pure, bearing only a 
sparse scattering of white-flecked pebbles and other detritus. 
Little farms spring up at random here, regularly tended by the 
inhabitants throughout the year, and bordered by low, knotted 
fences. Houses, barns, and other wooden structures freckle the 
surrounding grassland, plainly visible from the proper vantage. 
Where fully exposed, the grassy stalks of the surrounding 
countryside quiver and rustle with every stiff gust of wind. 
   A forest looms darkly to the west, ending the stretch of 
plains in that direction. To the south and east a tall, rocky 
hill slopes upward, while to the north the fields press on.

On a Series of Hills, Bordering a Narrow Valley~
   A row of rounded hills looms over the narrow Stonewain valley 
to the south and west here, climbing and plunging in ranks as the 
undulating landscape radiates outward from this point. The 
highland here is composed of hard earth, only loosely spotted 
with vegetation, ribs of dry limestone and ridged granite folded 
in with the grainy soil. To the north the hills grow more dense 
and numerous, while to the east they continue in much the same 
fashion, extending on in a broad, solid line. From the right 
viewpoint here, the canopy of a light woodland can be spied in 
the distance to the northeast beyond another series of hills.

Amidst Hilly Terrain~
   Moss and lichen swarm about the rough ridges of stone that 
comprise the bony highland here, peppering the rock underfoot in 
swathes of bright colour. In every direction, rocky-edged hills 
range in great waves, some loosely spotted with patches of grass, 
but most bleak, and devoid of dense growth. To the northeast, 
visible in gaps between some of the higher hills of the region, 
the Grey Wood extends, its silver-grey birches bobbing like 
blades of grass in a strong wind. To the northwest the deep 
evergreen of the Druadan Forest colours the horizon, its dense 
canopy neigh impenetrable. Southward, the highland here grows 
somewhat sparser, as it approaches the northern edge of the 
Stonewain.

the earth scattered with loose debris, from shards of limestone 
to pebbles of granite, but otherwise predominantly bare. To the 
north the land tapers steadily downward, the slopes of the 
northernmost hills in this region merging with more level 
grassland in that bearing. Clearly visible from the proper 
vantage here, the Druadan Forest and the Grey Wood extend to the 
northwest and northwest respectively, the former wilderland dark 
and foreboding, and the latter spare but vibrant. To the south 
the highland here grows denser, hills rising and falling in 
broader, deeper ranks as the landscape stretches onward.

   The occasional finger of granite or limestone peeks above the 
surface of the grassy earth, running in short ridges about the 
fields. Patches of bright-flowered goldenrod bloom here in 
warmer seasons, thriving in the open fieldland. Woody bushes of 
boxthorn, scraggy and bleak in the winter and laden with plump 
red berries in spring, pepper the encircling grassland. Thick 
swathes of weedy grass carpet the landscape here, growing dense 
and tight in the fertile soil underfoot. The dark soil of the 
land here is plainly arable and largely pure, bearing only a 
sparse scattering of white-flecked pebbles and other detritus. 
   Stony-faced hills rise to the south, the terrain here rising 
sharply in that direction. The grassland disappears to the west 
and east, where the Druadan Forest and the Grey Wood grow.

A Field Separating Druadan Forest and Grey Wood~
   Tall hawthorns, bristling with thorny branches and pale green 
foliage, bloom with spotted white flowers across the grassland 
here in fairer seasons. Low, broad hillocks add a depth to this 
otherwise flat stretch of countryside, rising and falling in 
gentle waves across the terrain. Wild trees grow in sparse 
copses over the land, few in number. Above, the sky unfolds in a 
great dome, clear in view from the wide flats and gentle slopes 
of the encompassing grassland below. Where fully exposed, the 
grassy stalks of the surrounding countryside quiver and rustle 
with every stiff gust of wind. 
   The birch-filled Grey Wood rises eastward, while westward 
stands the Druadan Forest, dark, and somewhat menacing from this 
viewpoint.

A Clearing Between the Grey Wood and the Druadan Forest~
   The dark earth of the encircling fieldland is replete with 
scraggly weeds and tall bushes. Thin clusters of trees grow in 
small, sparse thickets about the region here, plain in sight. 
The fields here, though bare and bleak in the depths of winter, 
are a tapestry of many colours in the summer and spring, speckled 
with wildflowers and other blooming flora. The terrain here is 
lined with bony ribs of limestone that crest the earth underfoot 
at odd intervals, strewn with mosses and shrubs. The landscape 
teems with a vasty array of high, reedy grasses, prospering in 
the rich soil of the countryside. 
   Eastward and westward the fields here disperse, meeting dense 
woodland in either direction. 
    A short distance to the north the sharpened tops of a simple
log palisade are visible.

   The air that drifts above the grassline here has a crisp 
quality, sweetened by the grassland's proliferous wildflowers, 
and other fresh growth. A variety of wild herbs, from cowslip to 
sorrel, prosper here in the dank, fertile soil of the grassland. 
Herbaceous milkwort bushes thrive in the grassy landscape 
alongside other vegetation here, blooming purple in most months 
of the year. A thick coat of tall grass, ranging in colour from 
deep green to pale yellow, tufts the fields here in every 
direction. Rough sheets of granite and limestone occasionally 
crest the lush meadow turf of this region, weeds crawling over 
their exposed stony surfaces. 
   The murky deep of the Druadan Forest looms to the west, while 
to the east stands the much smaller Grey Wood.

Grassland Bordering the Druadan Forest~
   The higher ground here offers a wide and breathtaking view of 
bordering fields, which stretch on for a significant distance. 
On occasion the encompassing fieldland is grooved with low, 
craggy escarpments, their sloped limestone faces overrun with 
growth. Thick patches of clover grow in abundance here amongst 
the tall grass of the encircling fields. The land here is 
cloaked in a dense carpet of grasses, ranging variously in type 
and colour. Small shrubs, and a variety of woody vegetation 
sprinkle the region, growing in close thickets over the flatland. 
   Both to the east, and to the west the wild fields here end, 
halted by the dark Druadan in the latter direction, and the Grey 
Wood in the former. 
    A log palisade rises from the grasslands to the south.

A Dense Corner of the Druadan Forest, Near Fields and Slopes~
   Shelves of dull, orange-grey fungus, speckled with grime, deck 
some of the older trees in this section of the forest. Ridges of 
murky grey limestone rise and fall here, adding a wild, 
unpredictable depth to the forest landscape. Ranks of trees rise 
proudly here in every direction, their low-hanging boughs 
intersecting above to choke out the sky. Dense brambles and 
other woody shrubs grow about the bases of the trees here, 
crawling over the serpentine roots that breach the surface of the 
earth below. Coriaceous nets of deep-green ivy have been cast 
about the forest flora, clinging fast to the trunks of trees and 
swarming about other vegetation. 
   To the south and northeast narrow fields range, hemming in 
this corner of the Druadan. Eastward the land rises swiftly, 
peaking in a distant, rock-bound hilltop.

Amidst Towering Trees on the Druadan's Eastern Border~
   Broad pine trees rise in great number here, the length of 
their lofty trunks teeming with gnarled branches and slender 
shoots. The trees of the woodland grow in close proximity, their 
contorted frames bent and pressed together, stifling the 
surroundings and inhibiting swift travel. With every strong gust 
of wind the aged trees here creak and groan, as if to converse 
with one another in low, mournful tones. The land here is 
remarkably uneven, furrowed with trenches and frowning with broad 
ridges of lichen-strewn grey limestone. The lower branches of 
the evergreens here, heavy with thorny foliage throughout all 
months of the year, droop overhead, nearly within arm's reach. 
   The treeline grows sparse to the east where the woodland 
arrives at a narrow stretch of settled grassland.

   The fringes of a great abundance of evergreens that stretches 
far into the distance to the north cling to the bare and rocky 
surface of the high hills that rise and fall in many ranks here. 
Careful steps are required to navigate mixture of pebbly stone 
and dusty soil that carpets the ground in this region, the uneven 
ground difficult to traverse. To the south and west, a narrow 
valley runs parallels to the slopes here, dividing them from the 
great bulk of Mindolluin that thrusts skyward in the same 
direction. Northward the Druadan Forest extends, while to the 
east the hills here continue to rise and fall, growing more 
numerous and dense. 

To the west, on the face of a rocky hillside, a black crevice leers
from behind a tall boulder, hinting at a sheltered cave beyond.

The Southeastern Tip of the Dense Druadan Wood~
   Below its thick green canopy, the Druadan is only ever kindled 
in a dim, otherworldly twilight, even at the peak of day. The 
landscape of the Druadan is rarely flat and even; shelves of 
rock, mostly limestone and granite, thrust up through the earth 
at intervals, forming mossy escarpments and low ridges. 
Throughout the landscape, the towering, ponderous evergreens of 
the Druadan loom, their bristling frames drooping with age. 
Ferns, nettles, herbs and woody bushes of various sorts struggle 
for dominance in the shady world beneath the treeline here. The 
Druadan, unhindered in growth for a countless passing of years, 
has a primeval look, and seems utterly devoid of civilization. 
   The forest reaches its southeastern expanse here, bordered to 
the south, east, and west by rocky foothills.

Below the Druadan's Thick Canopy, Nearing Fields to the East~
   Dense thickets of tenacious, woody shrub-life dot the 
surrounding terrain. The craggy woodland ground is broken by a 
mazy network of sinuous roots, which radiate outward from the 
nearby evergreens in every direction. Towering firs loom over 
the landscape, the forest ground peppered with dry cones that 
have fallen from their gnarled limbs. Spruces are especially 
common here, their long trunks wrapped in bushy, conic cloaks of 
blue-green needles, their lowest boughs drooping downward at 
man-height. The craggy woodland ground is broken by a mazy 
network of sinuous roots, which radiate outward from the nearby 
evergreens in every direction. 
   The forest reaches its eastern boundary here, meeting a 
relatively treeless span of grassland in that direction

Amid Evergreens in the Druadan's Eastern Outskirts~
   The earth underfoot is dank and dark but covered in a loose 
blanket of debris, from dry yellow needles, to shrivelled strips 
of rotten bark. Mountainous firs and pines rise in dense 
thickets throughout the woodland, tall trunks ribbed and knotted, 
and sheathed in stony bark. The trees here grow in close 
vicinity, gnarled boughs converging above, their knurled, sooty 
trunks weeping deep amber sap. Though largely silent, the 
woodland here hums with ambient noise, from the faint whirring of 
native flies and beetles, to the clattering and moaning of the 
encompassing trees in a strong wind. Thick, grimy roots creep 
outward in webs from the bases of surrounding trees, burrowing in 
and out of the black earth. 
   Eastward the treeline thins, stopping at a strip of grassy 
scrubland.

Within the Primeval Druadan, West of a Field~
   Coriaceous nets of deep-green ivy have been cast about the 
forest flora, clinging fast to the trunks of trees and swarming 
about other vegetation. A smattering of glossy-leaved 
wildflowers lend the woodland here colour in the warmer months, 
but lie withered and dead in winter. Thick blankets of dark 
green moss swathe the broad trunks of the Druadan's ancient 
evergreens, and pad the ground underfoot in heavy patches. Lofty 
pines, bulky spruces and colossal firs grow side by side in close 
proximity throughout the surrounding woodland. Shelves of dull, 
orange-grey fungus, speckled with grime, deck some of the older 
trees in this section of the forest. 
   Grassy fields can be spied to the east from the proper 
viewpoint here, bringing an end to the Druadan's growth in that 
bearing.

The Eastern Fringes of the Druadan Forest~
   During the warmer seasons a variety of weedy grasses creep 
along the forest ground, tenacious in growth. Although a variety 
of trees may be spied in the surrounding woodland, spruce, fir 
and pine seem to dominate, their ponderous forms bristling with 
verdant, evergreen needles. Thick, twiggy brambles and nettles 
flank the archaic trunks of nearby trees, lying in wait to snag 
the feet of unwary passers-by. Webs of leathery ivy with deep 
green, spiny leaves spill over the boughs of the wooded flora 
here. The forest floor here is littered with fallen needles and 
other dry foliage, which soften one's step. 
   A lean stretch of grassland marks the forest's boundary to the 
east, while the woodland continues on in all other directions.

Within the Druadan Forest, Near its Eastern Edge~
   The Druadan, unhindered in growth for a countless passing of 
years, has a primeval look, and seems utterly devoid of 
civilization. Where not entirely overgrown with vegetation, dry 
debris litters the ground underfoot, carpeting the dank earth 
beneath. Massive pines, centuries old, dominate the forest 
landscape, their warped, rough-shod arms and stocky trunks 
screening ones view. Bulky firs are quite common throughout this 
stretch of the woodland, twisted boughs lifting crowns of 
needlelike foliage well above the earth at a dizzying height. 
Where not entirely overgrown with vegetation, dry debris litters

   To the north, west, and south, the forest stretches on, 
growing denser and darker. To the east the trees grow sparse, 
eventually met by a narrow strip of grassland.

flinty promontories and rocky fingers peeking often through the 
underbrush. Muggy air envelopes this stretch of the woodland, 
tinged with the odour of rotten wood and soil. Dense, 
black-green moss pads the forest floor in rough patches and blots 
the faces of the encircling evergreens at random. Irregular 
tracts of short tenacious grass, tangled with twigs and downed 
branches, rise haphazardly across the terrain here. The broad, 
twisted limbs of the Druadan's ancient evergreens sag overhead, 
bristling with spiky growth and laden with pinecones.

Druadan Forest at the Foothills of White Mountains~
   High above, the massive crowns of Druadan's towering trees 
meet, their bushy green boughs forming a nearly impenetrable 
canopy. The air of the Druadan is not crisp and clear but thick 
and oppressive, heavy with a persistent dampness. Broad pine 
trees rise in great number here, the length of their lofty trunks 
teeming with gnarled branches and slender shoots. During the 
warmer seasons a variety of weedy grasses creep along the forest 
ground, tenacious in growth. Webs of leathery ivy with deep 
green, spiny leaves spill over the boughs of the wooded flora

   Black-capped mushrooms grow in dense clusters about the bases 
of the surrounding trees, and in great numbers on the withered 
faces of fallen tree-boughs nearby. The steady drone of insects 
hidden from view amongst the dense brush pervades this stretch of 
the forest. The wide roots of the ancient trees that protrude 
above the forest floor here are slick with mould and crawling 
with moss. A wide assortment of weedy grasses grows in patches 
underfoot, sprinkling the forest floor with swathes of 
yellow-green colour. The rare dead or dying tree can be spied 
amongst the old, but vibrant forest life here, their leafless and 
skeletal frames plainly perceptible.

   Lofty pines droop in all directions here like eerie sentinels, 
their short boughs laden heavily with thorny growth. Dewy 
cobwebs lie on much of the vegetation here throughout most months 
of the year, gleaming silver even in low light. The landscape 
here undulates severely at times, rising swiftly into rocky 
hillocks before plunging down into deep gullies. An assortment 
of ferns and weeds carpet the forest floor during most months of 
the year, their leathery foliage ranging widely in colour. The 
occasional rocky crag emerges through the earthen woodland floor, 
grey limestone faces freckled with blood red lichen.

spiny nettles and other vegetation here, thriving in the deep 
shade. A vast dome of needlelike growth, lush and verdant even 
in winter, crowns the Druadan here and nearly completely blots 
out the sky above. Bushy mantles of prickly foliage cloak the 
weighty spruces that grow here, their long needles a silvery 
blue-green in hue. The earth underfoot is dank and dark but

flora, clinging fast to the trunks of trees and swarming about

contorted frames bent and pressed together, stifling the 
surroundings and inhibiting swift travel. The lower branches of 
the evergreens here, heavy with thorny foliage throughout all 
months of the year, droop overhead, nearly within arm's reach. 
The land here is remarkably uneven, furrowed with trenches and 
frowning with broad ridges of lichen-strewn grey limestone. 
Ancient roots crawl outward from the thick bases of some of the 
older trees here, weaving through and across the black earth 
underfoot like hoary, rough-skinned serpents. Sheets of thick, 
old bark, swarming with knots and whorls, are wrapped about the 
pines and firs here like primeval armour, split with age.

the deep of night, the Druadan is only ever dimly illuminated, 
its bristling canopy absorbing nearly all light from above. 
Thick patches of moss cling to the bases of many of the trees 
here, coating roots and trunks alike. Towering firs loom over

   Dense, black-green moss pads the forest floor in rough patches

Though largely silent, the woodland here hums with ambient noise, 
from the faint whirring of native flies and beetles, to the

spiny nettles and other vegetation here, thriving in the deep 
shade. Tightly-woven traceries of thorny-leaved ivy hang from 
the tree boughs in view, spotted with white flowers in the warmer 
months of the year. A rock-ribbed landscape churns below the 
lofty treeline, flinty promontories and rocky fingers peeking 
often through the underbrush. 
   To the north a small, rain-fed lake of cloudy water lies in 
the midst of the landscape.

On the Edges of a Cloudy, Rain-fed Lake~
   The Druadan's dense treeline folds back here, revealing a 
broad lake of placid, cloudy water. The lake sits in a deep, 
pebbly basin in the midst of the woodland, and appears to be 
rain-fed, having no visible access to tributaries of any sort. 
Muddy gullies in the encircling forest spill out into the murky 
pool, the land sloping noticeably downward in its direction. 
Gnarled boughs of evergreens twist out over the basin, the 
surface of the water littered with their spiny foliage. Flies 
and other insects hum over the lake's breadth in thick clouds, 
and fill the atmosphere here with a dim, persistent drone. 
   The woodland presses on in all directions, growing denser as 
it peels back from the lake's edge.

   The land here is cloaked in a dense carpet of grasses, ranging 
variously in type and colour. On occasion the encompassing 
fieldland is grooved with low, craggy escarpments, their sloped 
limestone faces overrun with growth. Herds of livestock cross 
the landscape at random here in most seasons, grazing on the 
countryside's lush bounty. Small cottages of stone and wood dot 
the horizon, adjacent to a patchwork of fenced crofts. Tall 
hawthorns, bristling with thorny branches and pale green foliage, 
bloom with spotted white flowers across the grassland here in 
fairer seasons.

   A thick coat of tall grass, ranging in colour from deep green 
to pale yellow, tufts the fields here in every direction. A 
number of small, well-managed orchards grow in narrow allotments 
in the distance, flanked on all sides by high, brambly hedges. 
Inhabitants of the farmland here can occasionally be spied, 
weaving their way across the rough paths that divide the wild 
scenery, or crossing between buildings on the borders of their 
tofts. The air that drifts above the grassline here has a crisp 
quality, sweetened by the grassland's proliferous wildflowers, 
and other fresh growth. Woody shrubs of dogwood dot the 
surrounding region, bristling with slender branches and crowned 
with garlands of pale white petals in spring.

Broad, Fertile Anorien Land~
   Few wild trees grow in the surrounding grassland, but those 
that do, though usually spare and thin, are easy to spot. Small 
shrubs and a variety of woody vegetation sprinkle the region, 
growing in close thickets over the flatland. Thick patches of 
clover grow in abundance here amongst the tall grass of the 
encircling fields. Lengthy rows of wheat and barely grow 
tenaciously in the tilled plots of nearby farms, bobbing in the 
wind. Over a great expanse, broad hills gently rise and fall 
here, lending the terrain a gradual depth.

On Pastoral Anorien Terrain~
   Now and then, the terrain here folds gently into long, broad 
hills, ringed with a stunning array of vegetation. Houses, 
barns, and other wooden structures freckle the surrounding 
grassland, plainly visible from the proper vantage. The 
occasional finger of granite or limestone peeks above the surface 
of the grassy earth, running in short ridges about the fields. 
Patches of bright-flowered goldenrod bloom here in warmer 
seasons, thriving in the open fieldland. The dark soil of the 
land here is plainly arable and largely pure, bearing only a 
sparse scattering of white-flecked pebbles and other detritus.

Surrounded by Fields in the Midst of Anorien~
   Cows, sheep and other tame livestock roam the pastures here in 
daylight, often guided by herdsmen who linger not far behind. 
The fields here, though bare and bleak in the depths of winter, 
are a tapestry of many colours in the summer and spring, speckled 
with wildflowers and other blooming flora. Rows of heather grow 
alongside a variety of other herbs and vegetation here, often 
bristling with crowns of lavender flowers. In farms that pepper 
the landscape, barley, wheat and other grain crops are sown, 
planted in narrow allotments. Large cultivated crofts divide 
portions of the surrounding countryside into segments, bordered 
by high wooden fences.

Fringes of Anorien Countryside, Rounded by a Great Road~
   Thick swathes of weedy grass carpet the landscape here, 
growing dense and tight in the fertile soil underfoot. Little 
farms spring up at random here, regularly tended by the 
inhabitants throughout the year, and bordered by low, knotted 
fences. Where fully exposed, the grassy stalks of the 
surrounding countryside quiver and rustle with every stiff gust 
of wind. The horizon is dotted sporadically with scanty trees, 
their twisted boughs lifted high above the field line. Woody 
bushes of boxthorn, scraggy and bleak in the winter and laden 
with plump red berries in spring, pepper the encircling 
grassland. 
   Coursing in a broad arc to the west and south, the Great West 
Road stretches forth, halting the stretch of grassland here in 
either bearing.

   Above, the sky unfolds in a great dome, clear in view from the 
wide flats and gentle slopes of the encompassing grassland below. 
Thin clusters of trees grow in small, sparse thickets about the 
region here, plain in sight. Rolling gently, broad hillocks 
climb and fall across the surrounding fields regularly. Small 
wooden structures have been erected on privately-owned tofts 
across the fields, ringed with tended hedges. The terrain here 
is lined with bony ribs of limestone that crest the earth

On Fields in Wide Anorien~
   Long, wide stretches of the grassland here are perfectly flat, 
offering an excellent, unobscured view of the encompassing 
region. Patches of bright-flowered goldenrod bloom here in 
warmer seasons, thriving in the open fieldland. Now and then,

On Cultivated Anorien Grassland~
   Low, broad hillocks add a depth to this otherwise flat stretch 
of countryside, rising and falling in gentle waves across the 
terrain. Herbaceous milkwort bushes thrive in the grassy 
landscape alongside other vegetation here, blooming purple in 
most months of the year. A variety of wild herbs, from cowslip 
to sorrel, prosper here in the dank, fertile soil of the 
grassland. Fenced rectangular plots litter the tamer corners of 
the encircling grassland, tended and tilled by resident farmers. 
Rough sheets of granite and limestone occasionally crest the lush 
meadow turf of this region, weeds crawling over their exposed 
stony surfaces.

Gently Rolling Anorien Countryside~
   Small cottages of stone and wood dot the horizon, adjacent to 
a patchwork of fenced crofts. The higher ground here offers a 
wide and breathtaking view of bordering fields, which stretch on 
for a great distance. Dirt paths are beaten across the ground 
here in a haphazard network, pounded and furrowed with telltale 
signs of the passing of human traffic. On occasion the 
encompassing fieldland is grooved with low, craggy escarpments, 
their sloped limestone faces overrun with growth. Herds of

Upon the Winding Great West Road~
   The roadway here is surprisingly well-maintained, its surface 
only lightly marred by the impact of passing traffic. Though 
speckled with grime, the limestone of the thoroughfare here still 
glistens bright in sunlight or moonlight, especially after a 
recent rain. The sky unfolds majestically above the stretching 
causeway that lies below, unobstructed in view. Small, rounded 
grey cobblestones fill gaps in the highway underfoot, set into a 
tight, uniform pattern. Long, rectangular blocks of heavy, 
roughly-hewn limestone curb either side of the progressing 
roadway. 
   The road enters into a gentle bend here, coursing from west to 
south.

Fields of Anorien, Bordered by a Curving Courseway~
   Over a great expanse, broad hills gently rise and fall here, 
lending the terrain a gradual depth. Tall hawthorns, bristling 
with thorny branches and pale green foliage, bloom with spotted 
white flowers across the grassland here in fairer seasons. The 
land here is cloaked in a dense carpet of grasses, ranging 
variously in type and colour. Small shrubs, and a variety of 
woody vegetation sprinkle the region, growing in close thickets 
over the flatland. Thick patches of clover grow in abundance 
here amongst the tall grass of the encircling fields. 
   A great road of white and black flagstone winds on to the

   The air that drifts above the grassline here has a crisp

and other fresh growth. Sown into the well-tended farmland 
nearby are ranks of oats and barley, growing bountifully 
throughout the summer with the proper attention. Wild trees grow 
in sparse copses over the land, few in number. A number of 
small, well-managed orchards grow in narrow allotments in the 
distance, flanked on all sides by high, brambly hedges. 
Inhabitants of the farmland here can occasionally be spied, 
weaving their way across the rough paths that divide the wild

landscape teems with a vast array of high, reedy grasses, 
prospering in the rich soil of the countryside. The dark earth 
of the encircling fieldland is replete with scraggly weeds and 
tall bushes. The fields here, though bare and bleak in the 
depths of winter, are a tapestry of many colours in the summer

The Great West Road, North of Amon Din~
   Though the Great West Road is fairly well maintained, the odd 
flagstone here has fractured due to traffic or weather. A few of 
the flagstones below are flecked with mud, their exteriors 
seemingly permanently stained by an infusion of grime. Fitted 
rectangular blocks flank either side of this wide highway, 
spotted with moss and lichen. The road here is constituted by a 
patchwork of cobbles and flagstones, their slightly rounded edges 
intersecting at tight angles to form a nearly flawless surface. 
Intermittently, a wagon or traveller passes by on the 
thoroughfare, sometimes accompanied by patrols of guardsmen from 
the local townships of northern Anorien. 
   Southward lie the beginnings of a rocky hill. To the west lie 
fields, and a deep forest beyond, while the road continues 
elsewhere. 
   A huge pavilion is set in the middle of an encampment of 
Marchwardens and soldiers of Great Lord Astirian.

The Great West Road, Stretching North and South~
   In the slender earthen lines that divide the limestone tiles 
of the sprawling roadway small tufts of weedy grasses are 
beginning to grow. Black marble milestones can be spied at 
regular intervals on either side of the thoroughfare, their bases 
overgrown with woody vegetation. The faces of some of the 
flagstones of the thoroughfare here are speckled with lichen, 
others spotted with patches of grey-green moss. Cobblestones of 
an ashen shade occupy narrow rifts in the otherwise unbroken 
surface of the Great West Road, their contours rounded, and a bit 
worn. Passing wagons have driven shallow ruts into the tiles 
below, which fill often with water in the wetter seasons of the 
year. 
   Farmed fields lie on either side of the road to the west and 
east.

At a Bend in the Great West Road~
   Though predominantly straight, the wide Great West Road 
occasionally dips into long twists and bends, gently 
accommodating the shape of the surrounding countryside. Broad, 
irregular-edged flagstones comprise much of the road that courses 
through this stretch of the countryside. Low, square-columned 
milestones of marble flank the road here at regular intervals, 
their surfaces lightly etched with tengwar inscriptions, now 
largely faded. Only a few travelers traverse the cobbled 
thoroughfare here, those that do appearing dusty and worn. From 
the right vantage, the blue-grey peaks of the White Mountains can 
be distantly spied to the south, mounting high above the horizon. 
   The road enters into a general curve here from west to south. 
To the north and east, the wide, cultivated plains of Anorien 
stretch on.

   The occasional grey or black cobble peeks out from amongst the 
white limestone of the course underfoot, a bit jarring to the 
eye. A testament to Gondorian engineering, this stretch of the 
Great West road, though heavily aged, has nevertheless endured 
countless years of travel. Small, weedy clusters of vegetation 
have begun to poke through some of the wider the gaps in this 
stretch of road. The roadway here weaves rises and falls at odd 
intervals, in accordance with the contours of the encircling 
landscape. The heavens, clearly visible from this stretch of the 
broad roadway, extend high above. 
   On either side of the road, to the north and south, farmed 
grasslands range. A dark forest looms on the horizon to the 
southwest.

fields. Woody bushes of boxthorn, scraggy and bleak in the 
winter and laden with plump red berries in spring, pepper the

underfoot. Patches of bright-flowered goldenrod bloom here in 
warmer seasons, thriving in the open fieldland. Now and then, 
the terrain here folds gently into long, broad hills, ringed with

   To the south the fields disperse, brought to an end by the 
stretch of a wide, white-tiled highway.

floor with swathes of yellow-green colour. Black-capped 
mushrooms grow in dense clusters about the bases of the 
surrounding trees, and in great numbers on the withered faces of 
fallen tree boughs nearby. The rare dead or dying tree can be 
spied amongst the old, but vibrant forest life here, their 
leafless and skeletal frames plainly perceptible. 
   Eastward the Druadan thins, meeting a long strip of cultivated 
grassland that marks its boundary.

Within Encircling Evergreens at the Druadan's Northeastern Tip~
   Rangy shrubs bearing a variety of thorny vegetation are 
scattered throughout this stretch of the woodland. Particles of 
dust and pollen swirl through the woodland air, adding to the 
forests oppressive atmosphere. Ancient evergreens grow in legion 
throughout the woodland, their knotted bodies and wiry boughs 
thick, bulky, and sheathed in scabrous bark. Thick patches of 
moss cling to the bases of many of the trees here, coating roots 
and trunks alike. Dense thickets of tenacious, woody shrub-life 
dot the surrounding terrain. 
   The Druadan's northeastern tip is bordered to the north by a 
straight, stone-paved highway and to the east by farmed 
grasslands. To the west and south the woodland presses on.

The Great West Road, North of the Druadan Forest~
   The road sags into the occasional depression here, small 
potholes trodden into the predominantly flat face of the highway 
by heavy traffic. Thick flagstones of pale limestone have been 
fitted together to form the road underfoot, hammered firmly into 
the hard earth below. Curbs composed of fitted rectangular 
blocks have been driven into the earth on either side of the 
causeway here. The intermittent traveller can be spied crossing 
the road here infrequently, often arriving from lesser paths and 
arteries that intersect with the main highway. A number of the 
tiles that compose this length of the Great West Road have been 
bleached bone white by the sun, lending a unique depth of hue to 
the highway. 
   Northward, the broad inhabited fields of Anorien unfurl, while 
a far less inviting environment, the Druadan Forest, lies to the 
south.

In Anorien, East of a Thicket and North of the Great West Road~
   Inhabitants of the farmland here can occasionally be spied, 
weaving their way across the rough paths that divide the wild 
scenery, or crossing between buildings on the borders of their 
tofts. Fenced rectangular plots litter the tamer corners of the 
encircling grassland, tended and tilled by resident farmers. 
Wild trees grow in sparse copses over the land, few in number. 
Sown into the well-tended farmland nearby are ranks of oats and 
barley, growing bountifully throughout the summer with the proper 
attention. A number of small, well-managed orchards grow in 
narrow allotments in the distance, flanked on all sides by high, 
brambly hedges. 
   Southward the Great West Road runs, its northern boundaries 
meeting the fields of Anorien.

Amidst Fields in Anorien~
   On occasion the encompassing fieldland is grooved with low, 
craggy escarpments, their sloped limestone faces overrun with 
growth. Few wild trees grow in the surrounding grassland, but 
those that do, though usually spare and thin, are easy to spot. 
The land here is cloaked in a dense carpet of grasses, ranging 
variously in type and colour. Small shrubs, and a variety of 
woody vegetation sprinkle the region, growing in close thickets 
over the flatland. Tall hawthorns, bristling with thorny 
branches and pale green foliage, bloom with spotted white flowers 
across the grassland here in fairer seasons.

Below the Mighty Boughs of the Druadan Wood~
   The silence of the Druadan is broken often by the hushed 
rustling of foliage, and the muted chirping of insects and birds. 
The scraping of gnarled boughs and groaning of bending wood 
resounds with every strong gust of wind here, though the air 
between the broad frames of the encircling trees is most often 
still. Shafts of light, either from the sun at day, or the stars 
at night, cut through gaps in the high canopy above, illuminating 
the primeval Druadan in a murky glow. Twigs, cones, needles, 
leaves and other dry debris are spread loosely across the forest 
floor, scattered about by the wind. A network of winding paths 
has been cut through the ground underfoot here by the local 
wildlife, twisting with the rise and fall of the terrain.

Dense Druadan Woodland Near a White-Cobbled Highway ~
   The atmosphere here buzzes with muted sounds, from the humming 
of insects to the supernal crowing of distant birds. The lower 
branches of the evergreens here, heavy with thorny foliage 
throughout all months of the year, droop overhead, nearly within 
arms reach. Ancient roots crawl outward from the thick bases of 
some of the older trees here, weaving through and across the 
black earth underfoot like hoary, rough-skinned serpents. The 
trees of the woodland grow in close proximity, their contorted 
frames bent and pressed together, stifling the surroundings and 
inhibiting swift travel. Sheets of thick, old bark, swarming 
with knots and whorls, are wrapped about the pines and firs here 
like primeval armour, split with age. 
   As the forest presses northward here it gradually loses its 
density, eventually reaching the southern fringe of a straight 
cobbled road.

The Great West Road Through the Thick of Druadan Forest~
   Long, rectangular blocks of heavy, roughly-hewn limestone curb 
either side of the progressing roadway. To the northeast 
extensive fields of many grasses range, visible from nearly any 
point on this portion of the highway. The occasional tree has 
found purchase near the curbs of the road below, slender roots 
upturning the tiles that lie adjacent. The roadway here is 
surprisingly well-maintained, its surface only lightly marred by 
the impact of passing traffic. Though speckled with grime, the 
limestone of the thoroughfare here still glistens bright in 
sunlight or moonlight, especially after a recent rain. 
   The fringes of the dark Druadan Forest lie on either side of 
the roadway, tall evergreens frowning to the north and south.

Amidst a Thicket of Evergreens~
   Growing sparsely throughout this stretch of woodland, ancient 
evergreens rise here, their knotted bodies and wiry boughs thick, 
bulky, and sheathed in scabrous bark. Dense brambles and other 
woody shrubs flourish about the bases of the trees here, crawling 
over the serpentine roots that breach the surface of the earth 
below. The open canopy lifted above lets in many broad shafts of 
light during the daytime, coppices of brush prospering in the 
airy clearings that pepper the wood. A wide assortment of weedy 
grasses grow in patches underfoot, sprinkling the forest floor 
with swathes of yellow-green colour. 
   To the west the fringes of the Druadan Forest press in. To 
the north and east the woods dissolve into farmed plains, while 
to the south, the Great West Road separates this thicket from the 
rest of the Druadan.

Due North of a Dense Thicket, in the Anorien Countryside~
   Where fully exposed, the grassy stalks of the surrounding 
countryside quiver and rustle with every stiff gust of wind. The 
dark soil of the land here is plainly arable and largely pure, 
bearing only a sparse scattering of white-flecked pebbles and 
other detritus. Human feet have trod a network of paths through 
the fields, the sodden passages weaving off toward distant 
buildings and small, tilled meadows. Houses, barns, and other 
wooden structures freckle the surrounding grassland, plainly 
visible from the proper vantage. Little farms spring up at 
random here, regularly tended by the inhabitants throughout the 
year, and bordered by low, knotted fences. 
   Clearly visible to the south lies a dense thicket of trees.

In the Deepening Druadan Timberland~
   An assortment of ferns and weeds carpet the forest floor 
during most months of the year, their leathery foliage ranging 
widely in colour. Dense thickets of tenacious, woody shrub-life 
dot the surrounding terrain. Rangy shrubs bearing a variety of 
thorny vegetation are scattered throughout this stretch of the 
woodland. Whether at the peak of day, or the deep of night, the 
Druadan is only ever dimly illuminated, its bristling canopy 
absorbing nearly all light from above. The scent of sweet pine, 
exhaled by the woods many evergreens, pervades the senses here 
strongly.

At the Druadan's Northern Edge, Nearing a Road~
   Though largely silent, the woodland here hums with ambient 
noise, from the faint whirring of native flies and beetles, to 
the clattering and moaning of the encompassing trees in a strong 
wind. The trees here grow in close vicinity, gnarled boughs 
converging above, their knurled, sooty trunks weeping deep amber 
sap. Thick, grimy roots creep outward in webs from the bases of 
surrounding trees, burrowing in and out of the black earth. 
Mountainous firs and pines rise in dense thickets throughout the 
woodland, tall trunks ribbed and knotted, and sheathed in stony 
bark. Irregular tracts of short tenacious grass, tangled with 
twigs and downed branches, rise haphazardly across the terrain. 
   To the distant north a long highway of white flagstone runs, 
the Druadan growing sparse before meeting its southern border.

The Great West Road, Cutting Through Druadan Forest~
   Intermittently, a wagon or traveller passes by on the 
thoroughfare, sometimes accompanied by patrols of guardsmen from 
the local townships of northern Anorien. The highway here is 
wide and unobstructed, save for the infrequent fallen tree. From 
some of the higher bends of the Great West Road, one can spot the 
magnificent White Mountains in the distant the south, clawing 
upward in a craggy line. Though the Great West Road is fairly 
well maintained, the odd flagstone here has fractured due to 
traffic or weather. A few of the flagstones below are flecked 
with mud, their exteriors seemingly permanently stained by an 
infusion of grime. 
   The land grows utterly devoid of traffic to the south and 
north, where the boundaries of the ancient Druadan rise.

Within the Light Fringes of a Forest~
   Thick-boughed pines grow in sparse patches throughout the 
region here, lifting long branches plumed with spiny evergreen 
foliage high above the height of the average man. Spruces and 
firs are also found in abundance here, the ground underfoot 
peppered with debris fallen from their towering frames. The 
woodland here, lying only on the fringes of the great Druadan 
Forest, is not as densely composed as the substantial timberland 
that rises in the distance to the south. The underbrush thrives 
in the more open air of this broad grove, well sustained by the 
dewy soil that lies beneath it. 
   Eastward the woodland continues, while in all other directions 
it disperses, meeting either wide cultivated grasslands or 
cobbled highways.

In Anorien, North of a Broad Thicket~
   A number of small, well-managed orchards grow in narrow 
allotments in the distance, flanked on all sides by high, brambly 
hedges. Low, broad hillocks add a depth to this otherwise flat 
stretch of countryside, rising and falling in gentle waves across 
the terrain. A thick coat of tall grass, ranging in colour from 
deep green to pale yellow, tufts the fields here in every 
direction. Herbaceous milkwort bushes thrive in the grassy 
landscape alongside other vegetation here, blooming purple in 
most months of the year. Woody shrubs of dogwood dot the 
surrounding region, bristling with slender branches and crowned 
with garlands of pale white petals in spring. 
   A fairly dense copse of trees rises to the south, ending the 
spread of the fields here in that bearing.

underfoot like hoary, rough-skinned serpents. Webs of leathery 
ivy with deep green, spiny leaves spill over the boughs of the 
wooded flora here. High above, the massive crowns of Druadan's 
towering trees meet, their bushy green boughs forming a nearly 
impenetrable canopy. With every strong gust of wind the aged 
trees here creak and groan, as if to converse with one another in 
low, mournful tones. The atmosphere here buzzes with muted 
sounds, from the humming of insects to the supernal crowing of 
distant birds. 
   Due south, the edge of a still, murky lake cuts through the

South of a White-Cobbled Road in the Druadan Forest~
   The rare dead or dying tree can be spied amongst the old, but 
vibrant forest life here, their leafless and skeletal frames 
plainly perceptible. Throughout the landscape, the towering, 
ponderous evergreens of the Druadan loom, their bristling frames 
drooping with age. The wide roots of the ancient trees that 
protrude above the forest floor here are slick with mould and 
crawling with moss. Ferns, nettles, herbs and woody bushes of 
various sorts struggle for dominance in the shady world beneath 
the treeline here. Where not entirely overgrown with vegetation, 
dry debris litters the ground underfoot, carpeting the dank earth 
beneath. 
   In all directions the tightly-woven Druadan continues, save to 
the north where the trees part before ending at a long, 
white-cobbled highway.

The Great West Road, Under the Shadow of Druadan~
   Passing wagons have driven shallow ruts into the tiles below, 
which fill often with water in the wetter seasons of the year. 
Though remarkably well-preserved for its age, the roadway here 
nevertheless shows signs of deterioration, some of its flagstones 
tarnished and stained. The road here bends and swells with the 
rise and fall of the surrounding terrain. In the slender earthen 
lines that divide the limestone tiles of the sprawling roadway 
small tufts of weedy grasses are beginning to grow. Black marble 
milestones can be spied at regular intervals on either side of 
the thoroughfare, their bases overgrown with woody vegetation. 
   Anorien fields lie northward, while southward sway the dark 
evergreens of Druadan Forest.

In Anorien, Nearing a Road and a Dense Thicket~
   Little farms spring up at random here, regularly tended by the 
inhabitants throughout the year, and bordered by low, knotted 
fences. Long, wide stretches of the grassland here are perfectly 
flat, offering an excellent, unobscured view of the encompassing 
region. Thick swathes of weedy grass carpet the landscape here, 
growing dense and tight in the fertile soil underfoot. Patches 
of bright-flowered goldenrod bloom here in warmer seasons, 
thriving in the open fieldland. Woody bushes of boxthorn, 
scraggy and bleak in the winter and laden with plump red berries 
in spring, pepper the encircling grassland. 
   The grassland presses on here to the north and west, while to 
the east it ends at the edge of a woody thicket, and to the south 
it halts at the fringes of a broad paved road.

On Cultivated Anorien Grassland~
   Small wooden structures have been erected on privately-owned 
tofts across the fields, ringed with tended hedges. Cows, sheep 
and other tame livestock roam the pastures here in daylight, 
often guided by herdsmen who linger not far behind. The dark 
earth of the encircling fieldland is replete with scraggly weeds 
and tall bushes. The fields here, though bare and bleak in the 
depths of winter, are a tapestry of many colours in the summer 
and spring, speckled with wildflowers and other blooming flora. 
The landscape teems with a vast array of high, reedy grasses, 
prospering in the rich soil of the countryside.

In the Druadan Forest, North of Foothills and Mountains~
   The steady drone of insects hidden from view amongst the dense 
brush pervades this stretch of the forest. Black-capped 
mushrooms grow in dense clusters about the bases of the 
surrounding trees, and in great numbers on the withered faces of 
fallen tree boughs nearby. The atmosphere here is a heavy, 
oppressive soup, swimming with stray motes of dust and dander. 
Below its thick green canopy, the Druadan is only ever kindled in 
a dim, otherworldly twilight, even at the peak of day. Cobwebs 
enmesh much of the undergrowth here, and drift lazily above from 
the boughs of the trees when caught in a rare breeze. 
   Rolling foothills and stony mountains rise above the treeline 
to the distant south.

Under the Druadan's Gnarled Boughs~
   The occasional rocky crag emerges through the earthen woodland 
floor, grey limestone faces freckled with blood red lichen. 
Ancient evergreens grow in legion throughout the woodland, their 
knotted bodies and wiry boughs thick, bulky, and sheathed in 
scabrous bark. The landscape here undulates severely at times, 
rising swiftly into rocky hillocks before plunging down into deep 
gullies. Thick patches of moss cling to the bases of many of the 
trees here, coating roots and trunks alike. The craggy woodland 
ground is broken by a mazy network of sinuous roots, which 
radiate outward from the nearby evergreens in every direction.

A Stretch of the Druadan Forest, East of a Black Bog~
   Mountainous firs and pines rise in dense thickets throughout 
the woodland, tall trunks ribbed and knotted, and sheathed in 
stony bark. Tightly-woven traceries of thorny-leaved ivy hang 
from the tree boughs in view, spotted with white flowers in the 
warmer months of the year. The earth underfoot is dank and dark 
but covered in a loose blanket of debris, from dry yellow 
needles, to shrivelled strips of rotten bark. Thick, grimy roots 
creep outward in webs from the bases of surrounding trees, 
burrowing in and out of the black earth. A vast dome of 
needlelike growth, lush and verdant even in winter, crowns the 
Druadan here and nearly completely blots out the sky above. 
   To the west the thick forest is broken by the eastern fringe 
of a narrow, mossy bog.

In the Druadan Woodland, Approaching a Narrow Bog to the West~
   A network of winding paths has been cut through the ground 
underfoot here by the local wildlife, twisting with the rise and 
fall of the terrain. Ranks of trees rise proudly here in every 
direction, their low-hanging boughs intersecting above to choke 
out the sky. Shafts of light, either from the sun at day, or the 
stars at night, cut through gaps in the high canopy above, 
illuminating the primeval Druadan in a murky glow. Dense 
brambles and other woody shrubs grow about the bases of the trees 
here, crawling over the serpentine roots that breach the surface 
of the earth below. A smattering of glossy-leaved wildflowers 
lend the woodland here colour in the warmer months, but lie 
withered and dead in winter. 
   A black bog of dense peat moss sunders the treeline near to 
the west, draped in mist.

Among the Evergreens of the Druadan Woodland~
   Although a variety of trees may be spied in the surrounding 
woodland, spruce, fir and pine seem to dominate, their ponderous 
forms bristling with verdant, evergreen needles. With every 
strong gust of wind the aged trees here creak and groan, as if to 
converse with one another in low, mournful tones. During the 
warmer seasons a variety of weedy grasses creep along the forest 
ground, tenacious in growth. The forest floor here is littered 
with fallen needles and other dry foliage, which soften one's 
step. The air of the Druadan is not crisp and clear but thick 
and oppressive, heavy with a persistent dampness.

Between Old Druadan's Lofty Evergreens~
   The landscape of the Druadan is rarely flat and even; shelves 
of rock, mostly limestone and granite, thrust up through the 
earth at intervals, forming mossy escarpments and low ridges. 
The rare dead or dying tree can be spied amongst the old, but 
vibrant forest life here, their leafless and skeletal frames 
plainly perceptible. A wide assortment of weedy grasses grows in 
patches underfoot, sprinkling the forest floor with swathes of 
yellow-green colour. Ferns, nettles, herbs and woody bushes of 
various sorts struggle for dominance in the shady world beneath 
the treeline here. Throughout the landscape, the towering, 
ponderous evergreens of the Druadan loom, their bristling frames 
drooping with age.

In the Druadan Forest, Due West of a Muddy Lake~
   Dewy cobwebs lie on much of the vegetation here throughout 
most months of the year, gleaming silver even in low light. 
Lofty pines droop in all directions here like eerie sentinels, 
their short boughs laden heavily with thorny growth. Whether at 
the peak of day, or the deep of night, the Druadan is only ever 
dimly illuminated, its bristling canopy absorbing nearly all 
light from above. Rangy shrubs bearing a variety of thorny 
vegetation are scattered throughout this stretch of the woodland. 
The scent of sweet pine, exhaled by the woods many evergreens, 
pervades the senses here strongly. 
   From the right viewpoint here, the surface of a muddied lake 
can be spied to the east, hemmed in by a ring of encircling 
trees.

Within the Primeval Druadan~
   The broad, twisted limbs of the Druadan's ancient evergreens 
sag overhead, bristling with spiky growth and laden with 
pinecones. Bushy mantles of prickly foliage cloak the weighty 
spruces that grow here, their long needles a silvery blue-green 
in hue. Sickly grey fungus stipples the surfaces of fallen trees 
here, spreading over the dying wood like a death shroud. The 
earth underfoot is dank and dark but covered in a loose blanket 
of debris, from dry yellow needles, to shrivelled strips of 
rotten bark. The trees here grow in close vicinity, gnarled 
boughs converging above, their knurled, sooty trunks weeping deep 
amber sap.

The Druadan Forest, Near the Great West Road to the North~
   The scraping of gnarled boughs and groaning of bending wood 
resounds with every strong gust of wind here, though the air 
between the broad frames of the encircling trees is most often 
still. The silence of the Druadan is broken often by the hushed 
rustling of foliage, and the muted chirping of insects and birds. 
The atmosphere here is charged with the nose-tickling scent of 
pine, and the rich aroma of damp earth. Shelves of dull, 
orange-grey fungus, speckled with grime, deck some of the older 
trees in this section of the forest. Fallen trees occasionally 
inhibit swift travel through this section of the woodland, their 
timeworn surfaces rotted with age, but teeming with new life. 
   The Druadan stretches on to the west, south, and east, though 
it dissolves to the north where it is met by a wide paved road.

The Great West Road, Leading Through the Druadan Forest~
   From the right vantage, the blue-grey peaks of the White 
Mountains can be distantly spied to the south, mounting high 
above the treeline in that direction. Though predominantly 
straight, the wide Great West Road occasionally dips into long 
twists and bends, gently accommodating the shape of the 
surrounding countryside. The sky unfolds majestically above the 
stretching causeway that lies below, unobstructed in view. Only 
a few travelers traverse the cobbled thoroughfare here, those 
that do appearing dusty and worn. Broad, irregular-edged 
flagstones comprise much the road that courses through this 
stretch of the countryside. 
   The road unfolds from west to east, flanked to the north by 
Anorien farmlands, and to the south by the sinister Druadan 
Forest.

Amidst Fields, on Anorien's Southern Fringes~
   Sown into the well-tended farmland nearby are ranks of oats 
and barley, growing bountifully throughout the summer with the 
proper attention. A variety of wild herbs, from cowslip to 
sorrel, prosper here in the dank, fertile soil of the grassland. 
Rough sheets of granite and limestone occasionally crest the lush 
meadow turf of this region, weeds crawling over their exposed 
stony surfaces. A number of small, well-managed orchards grow in 
narrow allotments in the distance, flanked on all sides by high, 
brambly hedges. Wild trees grow in sparse copses over the land, 
few in number. 
   In the distance to the the south a long, white-cobbled road 
runs from west to east.

Gently Rolling Anorien Countryside~
   The higher ground here offers a wide and breathtaking view of 
bordering fields, which stretch on for a great distance. Thick 
patches of clover grow in abundance here amongst the tall grass 
of the encircling fields. Over a great expanse, broad hills 
gently rise and fall here, lending the terrain a gradual depth. 
On occasion the encompassing fieldland is grooved with low, 
craggy escarpments, their sloped limestone faces overrun with 
growth. Dirt paths are beaten across the ground here in a 
haphazard network, pounded and furrowed with telltale signs of 
the passing of human traffic.

North of Lofty White Peaks, in the Midst of the Druadan Forest~
   Muggy air envelopes this stretch of the woodland, tinged with 
the odour of rotten wood and soil. Irregular tracts of short 
tenacious grass, tangled with twigs and downed branches, rise 
haphazardly across the terrain here. Tightly-woven traceries of 
thorny-leaved ivy hang from the tree boughs in view, spotted with 
white flowers in the warmer months of the year. Broad ferns with 
leathery, jagged-edged fronds grow aside spiny nettles and other 
vegetation here, thriving in the deep shade. A rock-ribbed 
landscape churns below the lofty treeline, flinty promontories 
and rocky fingers peeking often through the underbrush. 
   The massive, sheer peaks of the White Mountains soar in the 
distance to the south, bordered by a ridge of rolling foothills.

Among the Evergreens of the Druadan Woodland~
   Ridges of murky grey limestone rise and fall here, adding a 
wild, unpredictable depth to the forest landscape. A network of 
winding paths has been cut through the ground underfoot here by 
the local wildlife, twisting with the rise and fall of the 
terrain. Twigs, cones, needles, leaves and other dry debris are 
spread loosely across the forest floor, scattered about by the 
wind. Dense brambles and other woody shrubs grow about the bases 
of the trees here, crawling over the serpentine roots that breach 
the surface of the earth below. Ranks of trees rise proudly here 
in every direction, their low-hanging boughs intersecting above 
to choke out the sky.

To the South of a Murky Bog in Druadan Forest~
   Sheets of thick, old bark, swarming with knots and whorls, are 
wrapped about the pines and firs here like primeval armour, split 
with age. Broad pine trees rise in great number here, the length 
of their lofty trunks teeming with gnarled branches and slender 
shoots. The land here is remarkably uneven, furrowed with 
trenches and frowning with broad ridges of lichen-strewn grey 
limestone. During the warmer seasons a variety of weedy grasses 
creep along the forest ground, tenacious in growth. Thick, 
twiggy brambles and nettles flank the archaic trunks of nearby 
trees, lying in wait to snag the feet of unwary passers-by. 
   A blanket of fog hovers over a deep bog of peat moss to the 
north.

On a Misty Bog of Black Peat in the Midst of Druadan Forest~
   A narrow strip of dank, marshy ground unfurls here, the 
Druadan's ancient evergreens twisting away from its fringes. The 
ground, ever-shifting underfoot, is a moist mass of decay, 
composed of clods of black mud and heaps of grimy peat, littered 
with other decomposing debris and slick with slime. Shoots of 
reeds and scraggly bushes blooming with leaves and petals of a 
sickly shade sprout about the bog's more distant edges. The air 
here is thick with a heady scent, the bog's earthen damp mingling 
with the faint sweetness of the pine forest encircling it, 
producing a strange, somewhat unappealing odour. 
   Northward the bog here stretches on. To the west, east and 
south the bog's expanse is subsumed by the dark body of the 
Druadan Forest.

Within a Misty Stretch of Bog, in the Heart of the Druadan~
   Floating low to the ground here are serpentine tendrils of 
pale fog, breathed, it seems, from the very chasms of the earth 
below, and quick to dissipate in any stiff gust of wind. Beneath 
this vaporous blanket lies the damp, uneven soil of a bog of 
black peat, muddy and swarming with clumps of wiry moss. Pools 
of brackish water sit in deep troughs throughout the landscape, 
viscous and unclear. About the narrow strip of heathland loom 
the hoary evergreens of the Druadan, sheltering the earth beneath 
with their aged and heavily-laden boughs 
   The Druadan rises in all directions, save to the south, where 
the bog here continues its expanse.

North of a Patchy Bog, in the Druadan Forest~
   A vast dome of needlelike growth, lush and verdant even in 
winter, crowns the Druadan here and nearly completely blots out 
the sky above. The broad, twisted limbs of the Druadan's ancient 
evergreens sag overhead, bristling with spiky growth and laden 
with pinecones. Dense, black-green moss pads the forest floor in 
rough patches and blots the faces of the encircling evergreens at 
random. The earth underfoot is dank and dark but covered in a 
loose blanket of debris, from dry yellow needles, to shrivelled 
strips of rotten bark. Bushy mantles of prickly foliage cloak 
the weighty spruces that grow here, their long needles a silvery 
blue-green in hue. 
   A patchy bog of earthy peat moss lies southward.

Amidst the Towering Trees of Ancient Druadan~
   Thick blankets of dark green moss swathe the broad trunks of 
the Druadan's ancient evergreens, and pad the ground underfoot in 
heavy patches. Shafts of light, either from the sun at day, or 
the stars at night, cut through gaps in the high canopy above, 
illuminating the primeval Druadan in a murky glow. The scraping 
of gnarled boughs and groaning of bending wood resounds with 
every strong gust of wind here, though the air between the broad 
frames of the encircling trees is most often still. A smattering 
of glossy-leaved wildflowers lend the woodland here colour in the 
warmer months, but lie withered and dead in winter. Lofty pines, 
bulky spruces and colossal firs grow side by side in close 
proximity throughout the surrounding woodland.

   The lower branches of the evergreens here, heavy with thorny 
foliage throughout all months of the year, droop overhead, nearly 
within arms reach. The trees of the woodland grow in close 
proximity, their contorted frames bent and pressed together, 
stifling the surroundings and inhibiting swift travel. With 
every strong gust of wind the aged trees here creak and groan, as 
if to converse with one another in low, mournful tones. High 
above, the massive crowns of Druadan's towering trees meet, their 
bushy green boughs forming a nearly impenetrable canopy. The 
atmosphere here buzzes with muted sounds, from the humming of 
insects to the supernal crowing of distant birds.

   Massive pines, centuries old, dominate the forest landscape, 
their warped, rough-shod arms and stocky trunks screening ones 
view. The wide roots of the ancient trees that protrude above 
the forest floor here are slick with mould and crawling with 
moss. The steady drone of insects hidden from view amongst the 
dense brush pervades this stretch of the forest. Where not 
entirely overgrown with vegetation, dry debris litters the ground 
underfoot, carpeting the dank earth beneath. Bulky firs are 
quite common throughout this stretch of the woodland, twisted 
boughs lifting crowns of needlelike foliage well above the earth 
at a dizzying height.

Northern Boundaries of the Druadan Forest~
   Particles of dust and pollen swirl through the woodland air, 
adding to the forest's oppressive atmosphere. The occasional 
rocky crag emerges through the earthen woodland floor, grey 
limestone faces freckled with blood red lichen. An assortment of 
ferns and weeds carpet the forest floor during most months of the 
year, their leathery foliage ranging widely in colour. Thick 
patches of moss cling to the bases of many of the trees here, 
coating roots and trunks alike. Ancient evergreens grow in 
legion throughout the woodland, their knotted bodies and wiry 
boughs thick, bulky, and sheathed in scabrous bark. 
   A broad road of white flagstone appears to the north, ending 
the forest's expanse in that area.

The Great West Road, North and West of Druadan Forest~
   The heavens, clearly visible from this stretch of the broad 
roadway, extend high above. The occasional grey or black cobble 
peeks out from amongst the white limestone of the course 
underfoot, a bit jarring to the eye. Fitted rectangular blocks 
flank either side of this wide highway, spotted with moss and 
lichen. The roadway here weaves rises and falls at odd 
intervals, in accordance with the contours of the encircling 
landscape. A testament to Gondorian engineering, this stretch of 
the Great West road, though heavily aged, has nevertheless 
endured countless years of travel. 
   Northward and southward the breadth of the road comes to an 
end, bordered by Anorien and the Druadan Forest, respectively.

Southern Boundaries of Anorien Grassland~
   Thin clusters of trees grow in small, sparse thickets about 
the region here, plain in sight. Rows of heather grow alongside 
a variety of other herbs and vegetation here, often bristling 
with crowns of lavender flowers. Large cultivated crofts divide 
portions of the surrounding countryside into segments, bordered 
by high wooden fences. Small wooden structures have been erected 
on privately-owned tofts across the fields, ringed with tended 
hedges. Rolling gently, broad hillocks climb and fall across the 
surrounding fields regularly. 
   A road borders the land here to the south, bringing an abrupt 
end to the stretch of grassland in that direction.

Now and then, the terrain here folds gently into long, broad 
hills, ringed with a stunning array of vegetation. The 
occasional finger of granite or limestone peeks above the surface 
of the grassy earth, running in short ridges about the fields. 
Little farms spring up at random here, regularly tended by the 
inhabitants throughout the year, and bordered by low, knotted

Nearing White Mountains to the South, in Druadan Forest~
   The air of the Druadan is not crisp and clear but thick and 
oppressive, heavy with a persistent dampness. Sheets of thick, 
old bark, swarming with knots and whorls, are wrapped about the 
pines and firs here like primeval armour, split with age. 
Ancient roots crawl outward from the thick bases of some of the 
older trees here, weaving through and across the black earth 
underfoot like hoary, rough-skinned serpents. During the warmer 
seasons a variety of weedy grasses creep along the forest ground, 
tenacious in growth. Broad pine trees rise in great number here, 
the length of their lofty trunks teeming with gnarled branches 
and slender shoots. 
   The countryside slopes upward to the south here, the woodland 
climbing the roots of a series of high foothills that end at the 
base of great white mountains.

Underneath the Broad Canopy of the Deep Druadan~
   The atmosphere here is a heavy, oppressive soup, swimming with 
stray motes of dust and dander. The Druadan, unhindered in 
growth for a countless passing of years, has a primeval look, and 
seems utterly devoid of civilization. Below its thick green 
canopy, the Druadan is only ever kindled in a dim, otherworldly 
twilight, even at the peak of day. Cobwebs enmesh much of the 
undergrowth here, and drift lazily above from the boughs of the 
trees when caught in a rare breeze. Ferns, nettles, herbs and 
woody bushes of various sorts struggle for dominance in the shady 
world beneath the treeline here.

In the Druadan Forest~
   Towering firs loom over the landscape, the forest ground 
peppered with dry cones that have fallen from their gnarled 
limbs. The landscape here undulates severely at times, rising 
swiftly into rocky hillocks before plunging down into deep 
gullies. Dewy cobwebs lie on much of the vegetation here 
throughout most months of the year, gleaming silver even in low 
light. The craggy woodland ground is broken by a mazy network of 
sinuous roots, which radiate outward from the nearby evergreens 
in every direction. Spruces are especially common here, their 
long trunks wrapped in bushy, conic cloaks of blue-green needles, 
their lowest boughs drooping downward at man-height.

Amidst the Towering Trees of the Druadan Forest~
   Thick, grimy roots creep outward in webs from the bases of 
surrounding trees, burrowing in and out of the black earth. 
Sickly grey fungus stipples the surfaces of fallen trees here, 
spreading over the dying wood like a death shroud. Muggy air 
envelopes this stretch of the woodland, tinged with the odour of 
rotten wood and soil. The trees here grow in close vicinity, 
gnarled boughs converging above, their knurled, sooty trunks 
weeping deep amber sap. Mountainous firs and pines rise in dense 
thickets throughout the woodland, tall trunks ribbed and knotted, 
and sheathed in stony bark.

Within the Druadan Wood, Nearing a Bog to the East~
   The atmosphere here is charged with the nose-tickling scent of 
pine, and the rich aroma of damp earth. Coriaceous nets of 
deep-green ivy have been cast about the forest flora, clinging 
fast to the trunks of trees and swarming about other vegetation. 
Shelves of dull, orange-grey fungus, speckled with grime, deck 
some of the older trees in this section of the forest. Fallen 
trees occasionally inhibit swift travel through this section of 
the woodland, their timeworn surfaces rotted with age, but 
teeming with new life. Dense brambles and other woody shrubs 
grow about the bases of the trees here, crawling over the 
serpentine roots that breach the surface of the earth below. 
   Eastward the trees disperse, ending at the western fringe of a 
murky bog.

The Druadan Forest, West of a Black Peat Bog~
   The forest floor here is littered with fallen needles and 
other dry foliage, which soften one's step. The land here is 
remarkably uneven, furrowed with trenches and frowning with broad 
ridges of lichen-strewn grey limestone. The lower branches of 
the evergreens here, heavy with thorny foliage throughout all 
months of the year, droop overhead, nearly within arms reach. 
Thick, twiggy brambles and nettles flank the archaic trunks of 
nearby trees, lying in wait to snag the feet of unwary 
passers-by. Although a variety of trees may be spied in the 
surrounding woodland, spruce, fir and pine seem to dominate, 
their ponderous forms bristling with verdant, evergreen needles. 
   A black peat bog stretches out to the east, bringing an abrupt 
end to the treeline in that direction.

In the Ancient Druadan Wood~
   Where not entirely overgrown with vegetation, dry debris 
litters the ground underfoot, carpeting the dank earth beneath. 
The landscape of the Druadan is rarely flat and even; shelves of 
rock, mostly limestone and granite, thrust up through the earth 
at intervals, forming mossy escarpments and low ridges. A wide 
assortment of weedy grasses grows in patches underfoot, 
sprinkling the forest floor with swathes of yellow-green colour. 
Black-capped mushrooms grow in dense clusters about the bases of 
the surrounding trees, and in great numbers on the withered faces 
of fallen tree boughs nearby. The steady drone of insects hidden 
from view amongst the dense brush pervades this stretch of the 
forest.

Between the Knotted Evergreens of Druadan Forest~
   Whether at the peak of day, or the deep of night, the Druadan 
is only ever dimly illuminated, its bristling canopy absorbing 
nearly all light from above. Dense thickets of tenacious, woody 
shrub-life dot the surrounding terrain. Rangy shrubs bearing a 
variety of thorny vegetation are scattered throughout this 
stretch of the woodland. The scent of sweet pine, exhaled by the 
woods many evergreens, pervades the senses here strongly. Thick 
patches of moss cling to the bases of many of the trees here, 
coating roots and trunks alike.

Beneath the Druadan Forest's High Canopy~
   Tightly-woven traceries of thorny-leaved ivy hang from the 
tree boughs in view, spotted with white flowers in the warmer 
months of the year. Though largely silent, the woodland here 
hums with ambient noise, from the faint whirring of native flies 
and beetles, to the clattering and moaning of the encompassing 
trees in a strong wind. Broad ferns with leathery, jagged-edged 
fronds grow aside spiny nettles and other vegetation here, 
thriving in the deep shade. A rock-ribbed landscape churns below 
the lofty treeline, flinty promontories and rocky fingers peeking 
often through the underbrush. The earth underfoot is dank and 
dark but covered in a loose blanket of debris, from dry yellow 
needles, to shrivelled strips of rotten bark.

Amidst Gnarled Trees in the Druadan Forest~
   A smattering of glossy-leaved wildflowers lend the woodland 
here colour in the warmer months, but lie withered and dead in 
winter. Ridges of murky grey limestone rise and fall here, 
adding a wild, unpredictable depth to the forest landscape. 
Twigs, cones, needles, leaves and other dry debris are spread 
loosely across the forest floor, scattered about by the wind. 
The silence of the Druadan is broken often by the hushed rustling 
of foliage, and the muted chirping of insects and birds. The 
scraping of gnarled boughs and groaning of bending wood resounds 
with every strong gust of wind here, though the air between the 
broad frames of the encircling trees is most often still.

Fringes of the Druadan Forest, South of a Winding Cobble Course~
   With every strong gust of wind the aged trees here creak and 
groan, as if to converse with one another in low, mournful tones. 
Webs of leathery ivy with deep green, spiny leaves spill over the 
boughs of the wooded flora here. High above, the massive crowns 
of Druadan's towering trees meet, their bushy green boughs 
forming a nearly impenetrable canopy. The atmosphere here buzzes 
with muted sounds, from the humming of insects to the supernal 
crowing of distant birds. During the warmer seasons a variety of 
weedy grasses creep along the forest ground, tenacious in growth. 
   The treeline thins as it stretches northward, the wood parting 
as it reaches the southern edge of a winding, white-tiled road.

The Great West Road, Bending North to East~
   A number of the tiles that compose this length of the Great 
West Road have been bleached bone white by the sun, lending a 
unique depth of hue to the highway. The road sags into the 
occasional depression here, small potholes trodden into the 
predominantly flat face of the highway by heavy traffic. The 
faces of some of the flagstones of the thoroughfare here are 
speckled with lichen, others spotted with patches of grey-green 
moss. The intermittent traveller can be spied crossing the road 
here infrequently, often arriving from lesser paths and arteries 
that intersect with the main highway. Thick flagstones of pale 
limestone have been fitted together to form the road underfoot, 
hammered firmly into the hard earth below. 
   A general curve of the Great West Road begins here, the 
causeway arching from east to north.

On Rolling, Forested Druadan Terrain~
   The trees here grow in close vicinity, gnarled boughs 
converging above, their knurled, sooty trunks weeping deep amber 
sap. A vast dome of needlelike growth, lush and verdant even in 
winter, crowns the Druadan here and nearly completely blots out 
the sky above. Dense, black-green moss pads the forest floor in 
rough patches and blots the faces of the encircling evergreens at 
random. Irregular tracts of short tenacious grass, tangled with 
twigs and downed branches, rise haphazardly across the terrain 
here. Muggy air envelopes this stretch of the woodland, tinged 
with the odour of rotten wood and soil. 
   Southward the rolling terrain begins a quick climb, reaching 
foothills and white mountains beyond.

   Ranks of trees rise proudly here in every direction, their 
low-hanging boughs intersecting above to choke out the sky. A 
network of winding paths has been cut through the ground 
underfoot here by the local wildlife, twisting with the rise and 
fall of the terrain. Fallen trees occasionally inhibit swift 
travel through this section of the woodland, their timeworn 
surfaces rotted with age, but teeming with new life. Shelves of 
dull, orange-grey fungus, speckled with grime, deck some of the 
older trees in this section of the forest. Thick blankets of 
dark green moss swathe the broad trunks of the Druadan's ancient 
evergreens, and pad the ground underfoot in heavy patches.

Deep Within the Druadan Woodland~
   Thick, twiggy brambles and nettles flank the archaic trunks of 
nearby trees, lying in wait to snag the feet of unwary 
passers-by. The air of the Druadan is not crisp and clear but 
thick and oppressive, heavy with a persistent dampness. Ancient 
roots crawl outward from the thick bases of some of the older 
trees here, weaving through and across the black earth underfoot 
like hoary, rough-skinned serpents. The trees of the woodland 
grow in close proximity, their contorted frames bent and pressed 
together, stifling the surroundings and inhibiting swift travel. 
The lower branches of the evergreens here, heavy with thorny 
foliage throughout all months of the year, droop overhead, nearly 
within arm's reach.

A Bent River Within the Ancient Druadan~
   Covered by the otherworldly twilight, the muddied river floats 
past the towering, ponderous evergreens of the Druadan. The 
uneasy gloom of the trees resides over this river, although 
lacking the cobwebs and mat of needles, this river is certainly 
possessing the age and dim-lit nature of the rest of this area 
deep within Druadan.

   Pushing northward at a steady pace, this river passes through 
the Forest Druadan, weaving in amongst the lofty evergreens that 
grow from the dark soil. Covering the banks of this river, a mat 
of needles and a carpet of ferns is present. Burrowing beneath 
these ferns and needles to reach into the edges of the river are 
the grimy roots of the evergreen trees that have come to drink 
the brown water of the river.

   Leading into the base of Eilinach, this bridge passes over the 
river that cuts north and south through the Druadan Forest. This 
old bridge, constructed of wood now covered in thick, green moss, 
stands over the water. Although seemingly sturdy, the occasional 
missing log in the bridge would lead one to be cautious while 
crossing this ancient bridge.

A Rugged Druadan Landscape, by Hills and Mountains to the South~
   The landscape here undulates severely at times, rising swiftly 
into rocky hillocks before plunging down into deep gullies. The 
occasional rocky crag emerges through the earthen woodland floor, 
grey limestone faces freckled with blood red lichen. Particles 
of dust and pollen swirl through the woodland air, adding to the 
forest's oppressive atmosphere. Dewy cobwebs lie on much of the 
vegetation here throughout most months of the year, gleaming 
silver even in low light. Spruces are especially common here, 
their long trunks wrapped in bushy, conic cloaks of blue-green 
needles, their lowest boughs drooping downward at man-height. 
   The White Mountains, like a row of pearl-white teeth, bite 
through the terrain to the south, flanked by a series of rolling 
foothills.

In Druadan Forest, Nearing a Stone Hill's Base~
   Ferns, nettles, herbs and woody bushes of various sorts 
struggle for dominance in the shady world beneath the treeline 
here. Below its thick green canopy, the Druadan is only ever 
kindled in a dim, otherworldly twilight, even at the peak of day. 
The Druadan, unhindered in growth for a countless passing of 
years, has a primeval look, and seems utterly devoid of 
civilization. A wide assortment of weedy grasses grows in 
patches underfoot, sprinkling the forest floor with swathes of 
yellow-green colour. Throughout the landscape, the towering, 
ponderous evergreens of the Druadan loom, their bristling frames 
drooping with age. 
   To the west and north the terrain hikes upward, reaching the 
surging slopes of a grey stone hill that comes to a peak to the 
northwest.

Eilenach's Eastern Slope~
   Draped with sheets of low, pale grasses, the eastern slope of 
the beacon hill of Eilenach emerges from the wilderness here. 
Ribs and columns of bare grey stone thrust upward from the angled 
ground here at regular intervals, surfaces swimming in green 
lichen. The view from the worn hillside is quite commanding, the 
eastern horizon unobstructed by the great evergreens of the 
Druadan Forest that grow in legion on more level ground in the 
distance. Save for the grass carpeting its lower regions, the 
hillside here is largely bare, the scraped grey stone underfoot 
supporting little in the way of vegetation. 
   Westward the earth is shadowed by Eilenach's high stony peak, 
while to the north, east and south the Druadan Forest ranges.

The Druadan Woodland, Northeast of a Lofty Hill~
   A rock-ribbed landscape churns below the lofty treeline, 
flinty promontories and rocky fingers peeking often through the 
underbrush. A vast dome of needlelike growth, lush and verdant 
even in winter, crowns the Druadan here and nearly completely 
blots out the sky above. Mountainous firs and pines rise in 
dense thickets throughout the woodland, tall trunks ribbed and 
knotted, and sheathed in stony bark. The trees here grow in 
close vicinity, gnarled boughs converging above, their knurled, 
sooty trunks weeping deep amber sap. Sickly grey fungus stipples 
the surfaces of fallen trees here, spreading over the dying wood 
like a death shroud. 
   In the distance to the southwest a lofty hill of black-grey 
stone frowns over the nearby landscape, its northern and eastern 
slopes rising to the west and south, respectively.

but teeming with new life. Ridges of murky grey limestone rise 
and fall here, adding a wild, unpredictable depth to the forest 
landscape. Lofty pines, bulky spruces and colossal firs grow 
side by side in close proximity throughout the surrounding 
woodland. A smattering of glossy-leaved wildflowers lend the 
woodland here colour in the warmer months, but lie withered and 
dead in winter. Shafts of light, either from the sun at day, or 
the stars at night, cut through gaps in the high canopy above, 
illuminating the primeval Druadan in a murky glow.

Beneath the Broad Canopy of the Deep Druadan~
   During the warmer seasons a variety of weedy grasses creep 
along the forest ground, tenacious in growth. High above, the 
massive crowns of Druadan's towering trees meet, their bushy 
green boughs forming a nearly impenetrable canopy. Webs of 
leathery ivy with deep green, spiny leaves spill over the boughs 
of the wooded flora here. Ancient roots crawl outward from the 
thick bases of some of the older trees here, weaving through and 
across the black earth underfoot like hoary, rough-skinned 
serpents. Broad pine trees rise in great number here, the length 
of their lofty trunks teeming with gnarled branches and slender 
shoots.

Surrounded by the Druadan Woodland~
   Cobwebs enmesh much of the undergrowth here, and drift lazily 
above from the boughs of the trees when caught in a rare breeze. 
The landscape of the Druadan is rarely flat and even; shelves of 
rock, mostly limestone and granite, thrust up through the earth 
at intervals, forming mossy escarpments and low ridges. Bulky 
firs are quite common throughout this stretch of the woodland, 
twisted boughs lifting crowns of needlelike foliage well above 
the earth at a dizzying height. Where not entirely overgrown 
with vegetation, dry debris litters the ground underfoot, 
carpeting the dank earth beneath. The wide roots of the ancient 
trees that protrude above the forest floor here are slick with 
mould and crawling with moss. 
   To the north the forest grows scanty, the thick woodland 
gradually dispersing.

The Great West Road, Pressing on to the Distant Horizon~
   Small, rounded grey cobblestones fill gaps in the highway 
underfoot, set into a tight, uniform pattern. Long, rectangular 
blocks of heavy, roughly-hewn limestone curb either side of the 
progressing roadway. Low, square-columned milestones of marble 
flank the road here at regular intervals, their surfaces lightly 
etched with tengwar inscriptions, now largely faded. Though 
speckled with grime, the limestone of the thoroughfare here still 
glistens bright in sunlight or moonlight, especially after a 
recent rain. To the northeast extensive fields of many grasses 
range, visible from nearly any point on this portion of the 
highway. 
   To the east, the road ends at the southern boundaries of 
Anorien grassland. To the northwest the road presses forth, 
winding for what seems an eternity through the rest of Anorien, 
and on to other distant lands.

The Craggy Druadan Woodland, North of the White Mountains~
   The atmosphere here buzzes with muted sounds, from the humming 
of insects to the supernal crowing of distant birds. The air of 
the Druadan is not crisp and clear but thick and oppressive, 
heavy with a persistent dampness. Although a variety of trees 
may be spied in the surrounding woodland, spruce, fir and pine 
seem to dominate, their ponderous forms bristling with verdant, 
evergreen needles. Thick, twiggy brambles and nettles flank the 
archaic trunks of nearby trees, lying in wait to snag the feet of 
unwary passers-by. The land here is remarkably uneven, furrowed 
with trenches and frowning with broad ridges of lichen-strewn 
grey limestone. 
   The unlevel ground begins a general upward climb to the south, 
trundling into a bumpy line of hills. Further in that direction 
rise the White Mountains, crowned with garlands of fog.

In the Ancient Druadan Wood~
   Below its thick green canopy, the Druadan is only ever kindled 
in a dim, otherworldly twilight, even at the peak of day. The 
atmosphere here is a heavy, oppressive soup, swimming with stray 
motes of dust and dander. Black-capped mushrooms grow in dense 
clusters about the bases of the surrounding trees, and in great 
numbers on the withered faces of fallen tree-boughs nearby. 
Massive pines, centuries old, dominate the forest landscape, 
their warped, rough-shod arms and stocky trunks screening one's 
view. A wide assortment of weedy grasses grows in patches 
underfoot, sprinkling the forest floor with swathes of 
yellow-green colour.

here, coating roots and trunks alike. Rangy shrubs bearing a 
variety of thorny vegetation are scattered throughout this 
stretch of the woodland. Dense thickets of tenacious, woody 
shrub-life dot the surrounding terrain. An assortment of ferns 
and weeds carpet the forest floor during most months of the year, 
their leathery foliage ranging widely in colour. Ancient 
evergreens grow in legion throughout the woodland, their knotted 
bodies and wiry boughs thick, bulky, and sheathed in scabrous 
bark.

Within the Druadan, Near a Hill's Southern Slope~
   Broad ferns with leathery, jagged-edged fronds grow aside 
spiny nettles and other vegetation here, thriving in the deep 
shade. Tightly-woven traceries of thorny-leaved ivy hang from 
the tree boughs in view, spotted with white flowers in the warmer 
months of the year. Irregular tracts of short tenacious grass, 
tangled with twigs and downed branches, rise haphazardly across 
the terrain here. Thick, grimy roots creep outward in webs from 
the bases of surrounding trees, burrowing in and out of the black 
earth. Dense, black-green moss pads the forest floor in rough 
patches and blots the faces of the encircling evergreens at 
random. 
   From a clear vantage the southern slope of a high, craggy hill 
can be spied to the north, dominating the horizon in that 
direction.

The Southern Slope of Eilenach~
   The southern slope of a grey stone hill mounts skyward here, 
rising gradually above the encircling treeline. The slow bend of 
the hill here is easy to traverse, though northward the ground 
grows steadily more uneven. A carpet of low grass smoothly 
covers the bottom face of the beacon hill, thriving even in the 
year's colder seasons. Toward the base of the slope the 
ponderous evergreens of the Druadan Forest loom, crawling up its 
roots, but growing gradually more sparse at its higher altitudes. 
   The Druadan Forest ranges in all directions, save to the 
north, where the slope rises steeply to arrive at a peak of bare 
rock.

High Upon Eilenach~
   Grassy slopes slide up from all directions to reach this high 
hilltop, the peak here bare and rocky and devoid of green life. 
The face of the hilltop is far from smooth - ridges of stone, 
some as sharp as a knife's edge, mount above twisting pebbly 
pathways below, joining at a large, rounded slab of chalky grey 
gneiss that marks the hill's highest point, nearly inaccessible 
from here. Eilenach stands as an island besieged, alone in the 
midst of an evergreen sea; in every direction lies the vast 
expanse of the Druadan Forest, its bristly canopy roiling beneath 
the bend of a broad sky. Southward, a long range of White 
Mountains runs, shored up by woody foothills - the mountainous 
line bends gently to the north as it stretches westward, flanked 
there by more hills of a considerable size, one of which is 
especially noticeable from this vantage. The crest of the beacon 
hill of Amon Din thrusts above the eastern horizon, appearing 
hazy and blue from this distance. 
   The hill slopes steadily downward in all bearings from this 
point.

Upon the Northern Slope of Eilenach~
   Rocky, and mostly sheer, a hillside of wind-scoured grey stone 
rises here, curving gently to the southeast and southwest. 
Although the steep incline of the slope here makes swift travel a 
difficulty, narrow paths wind up and down its breadth, following 
the craggy shelves that pepper the rockface. On flat stretches 
of the hillock, long swathes of grass grow, ranging in colour 
from pale gold to deep green. The base of the slope is ringed 
with dense thickets of evergreens from the surrounding woodland, 
the gnarled trees unable to grow at the hill's greater heights. 
   A bare, rocky peak crowns the slope here to the south. In all 
other directions, the ancient Druadan spreads outward. To the 
west, the slope here drops steeply.

Within the Druadan, Near a Hill's Northern Slope~
   The scent of sweet pine, exhaled by the woods many evergreens, 
pervades the senses here strongly. Particles of dust and pollen 
swirl through the woodland air, adding to the forest's oppressive 
atmosphere. Spruces are especially common here, their long 
trunks wrapped in bushy, conic cloaks of blue-green needles, 
their lowest boughs drooping downward at man-height. The craggy 
woodland ground is broken by a mazy network of sinuous roots, 
which radiate outward from the nearby evergreens in every 
direction. The landscape here undulates severely at times, 
rising swiftly into rocky hillocks before plunging down into deep 
gullies. 
   The forest presses on all in directions here, but grows sparse 
to the south, where the northern base of grey stone hill thrusts 
through the treeline.

Beneath the Mighty Boughs of the Druadan Wood~
   Though largely silent, the woodland here hums with ambient 
noise, from the faint whirring of native flies and beetles, to 
the clattering and moaning of the encompassing trees in a strong 
wind. The broad, twisted limbs of the Druadans ancient 
evergreens sag overhead, bristling with spiky growth and laden 
with pinecones. Bushy mantles of prickly foliage cloak the 
weighty spruces that grow here, their long needles a silvery 
blue-green in hue. The earth underfoot is dank and dark but 
covered in a loose blanket of debris, from dry yellow needles, to 
shrivelled strips of rotten bark. A rock-ribbed landscape churns 
below the lofty treeline, flinty promontories and rocky fingers 
peeking often through the underbrush.

   Shelves of dull, orange-grey fungus, speckled with grime, deck 
some of the older trees in this section of the forest. The 
atmosphere here is charged with the nose-tickling scent of pine, 
and the rich aroma of damp earth. The silence of the Druadan is 
broken often by the hushed rustling of foliage, and the muted 
chirping of insects and birds. Thick blankets of dark green moss 
swathe the broad trunks of the Druadans ancient evergreens, and 
pad the ground underfoot in heavy patches. Twigs, cones, 
needles, leaves and other dry debris are spread loosely across 
the forest floor, scattered about by the wind. 
   The dense treeline grows visibly sparser to the north.

   Rangy shrubs bearing a variety of thorny vegetation are 
scattered throughout this stretch of the woodland. Whether at 
the peak of day, or the deep of night, the Druadan is only ever 
dimly illuminated, its bristling canopy absorbing nearly all 
light from above. Lofty pines droop in all directions here like 
eerie sentinels, their short boughs laden heavily with thorny 
growth. Towering firs loom over the landscape, the forest ground 
peppered with dry cones that have fallen from their gnarled 
limbs. An assortment of ferns and weeds carpet the forest floor 
during most months of the year, their leathery foliage ranging 
widely in colour. 
   The landscape here grows craggy and unpredictable, folding 
into a series of foothills to the south and ending at a high 
mountain range.

   Coriaceous nets of deep-green ivy have been cast about the 
forest flora, clinging fast to the trunks of trees and swarming 
about other vegetation. A network of winding paths has been cut 
through the ground underfoot here by the local wildlife, twisting 
with the rise and fall of the terrain. Ranks of trees rise 
proudly here in every direction, their low-hanging boughs 
intersecting above to choke out the sky. Dense brambles and 
other woody shrubs grow about the bases of the trees here, 
crawling over the serpentine roots that breach the surface of the 
earth below. Fallen trees occasionally inhibit swift travel

   The Druadan, unhindered in growth for a countless passing of 
years, has a primeval look, and seems utterly devoid of 
civilization. The rare dead or dying tree can be spied amongst 
the old, but vibrant forest life here, their leafless and 
skeletal frames plainly perceptible. Throughout the landscape, 
the towering, ponderous evergreens of the Druadan loom, their 
bristling frames drooping with age. Ferns, nettles, herbs and 
woody bushes of various sorts struggle for dominance in the shady 
world beneath the treeline here. Cobwebs enmesh much of the 
undergrowth here, and drift lazily above from the boughs of the 
trees when caught in a rare breeze.

Eilenach's Western Slope~
   Hemmed in on all sides by the deep Druadan, the western face 
of the beacon hill of Eilenach rises here. The slope here is 
very gradual - as a result, many evergreens from the surrounding 
wilderness have found purchase at its lower regions, draping it 
in a dense, verdant cloak. Where trees do not grow large swathes 
of grass do, teeming in the light soil that peppers the rockier 
stretches of the hillside. Bare boulders occasionally crest the 
healthy brush, growing more common as the hill continues to angle 
upward to the east. 
   Eastward, a bare peak of rock thrusts upward, while to the 
north, south, and west the Druadan Forest lies.

   The silence of the Druadan is broken often by the hushed 
rustling of foliage, and the muted chirping of insects and birds. 
Shelves of dull, orange-grey fungus, speckled with grime, deck 
some of the older trees in this section of the forest. Ridges of 
murky grey limestone rise and fall here, adding a wild, 
unpredictable depth to the forest landscape. Thick blankets of 
dark green moss swathe the broad trunks of the Druadan's ancient 
evergreens, and pad the ground underfoot in heavy patches. 
Shafts of light, either from the sun at day, or the stars at 
night, cut through gaps in the high canopy above, illuminating 
the primeval Druadan in a murky glow. 
   To the south and east the steep slopes of a rocky, 
grass-strewn hill stand, rising above the treeline. The slope to 
the east is especially sheer, and seems impossible to climb; the 
entrance to a cave sits in one bend of the rockface.

firs here like primeval armour, split with age. Broad pine trees

granite, thrust up through the earth at intervals, forming mossy 
escarpments and low ridges. Massive pines, centuries old,

their gnarled limbs. The landscape here undulates severely at 
times, rising swiftly into rocky hillocks before plunging down 
into deep gullies. 
   In every visible bearing the forest presses forth, thinning 
somewhat to the north.

On Wooded Slopes in Druadan Forest, Near Mountains~
   The trees of the woodland grow in close proximity, their 
contorted frames bent and pressed together, stifling the 
surroundings and inhibiting swift travel. High above, the 
massive crowns of Druadan's towering trees meet, their bushy 
green boughs forming a nearly impenetrable canopy. The air of 
the Druadan is not crisp and clear but thick and oppressive, 
heavy with a persistent dampness. The forest floor here is 
littered with fallen needles and other dry foliage, which soften 
one's step. The land here is remarkably uneven, furrowed with 
trenches and frowning with broad ridges of lichen-strewn grey 
limestone. 
   The terrain follows a general upward slope to the south, where 
the land rolls into a line of hills, before reaching the roots of 
a series of ponderous, white-capped mountains.

Amidst Knotted Evergreens in Druadan Forest~
   A wide assortment of weedy grasses grows in patches underfoot, 
sprinkling the forest floor with swathes of yellow-green colour. 
The Druadan, unhindered in growth for a countless passing of 
years, has a primeval look, and seems utterly devoid of 
civilization. The steady drone of insects hidden from view 
amongst the dense brush pervades this stretch of the forest. The 
rare dead or dying tree can be spied amongst the old, but vibrant 
forest life here, their leafless and skeletal frames plainly 
perceptible. Where not entirely overgrown with vegetation, dry 
debris litters the ground underfoot, carpeting the dank earth 
beneath. 
   In all directions the high trees of the Druadan lie.

Beneath the Mighty Boughs of the Druadan Wood~
   An assortment of ferns and weeds carpet the forest floor 
during most months of the year, their leathery foliage ranging 
widely in colour. Dense thickets of tenacious, woody shrub-life 
dot the surrounding terrain. Dewy cobwebs lie on much of the 
vegetation here throughout most months of the year, gleaming 
silver even in low light. The occasional rocky crag emerges 
through the earthen woodland floor, grey limestone faces freckled 
with blood red lichen. The craggy woodland ground is broken by a 
mazy network of sinuous roots, which radiate outward from the 
nearby evergreens in every direction. 
   To the north, east, and south the Druadan stretches forth. To 
the west it continues, growing deeper and darker.

In the Druadan Forest~
   Dense, black-green moss pads the forest floor in rough patches 
and blots the faces of the encircling evergreens at random. 
Though largely silent, the woodland here hums with ambient noise, 
from the faint whirring of native flies and beetles, to the 
clattering and moaning of the encompassing trees in a strong 
wind. Muggy air envelopes this stretch of the woodland, tinged 
with the odour of rotten wood and soil. The broad, twisted limbs 
of the Druadan's ancient evergreens sag overhead, bristling with 
spiky growth and laden with pinecones. The trees here grow in 
close vicinity, gnarled boughs converging above, their knurled, 
sooty trunks weeping deep amber sap. 
   The close treeline extends on all about, condensing noticeably 
to the west.

Deep Within the Druadan Wood~
   Twigs, cones, needles, leaves and other dry debris are spread 
loosely across the forest floor, scattered about by the wind. 
Coriaceous nets of deep-green ivy have been cast about the forest 
flora, clinging fast to the trunks of trees and swarming about 
other vegetation. The scraping of gnarled boughs and groaning of 
bending wood resounds with every strong gust of wind here, though 
the air between the broad frames of the encircling trees is most 
often still. A network of winding paths has been cut through the 
ground underfoot here by the local wildlife, twisting with the 
rise and fall of the terrain. A smattering of glossy-leaved 
wildflowers lend the woodland here colour in the warmer months, 
but lie withered and dead in winter. 
   The trees thicken to the west where the terrain slopes gently 
downward. To the north, east, and south, the forest presses on 
as before.

Amidst the Towering Trees of Ancient Druadan~
   Ancient roots crawl outward from the thick bases of some of 
the older trees here, weaving through and across the black earth 
underfoot like hoary, rough-skinned serpents. Webs of leathery 
ivy with deep green, spiny leaves spill over the boughs of the 
wooded flora here. The lower branches of the evergreens here, 
heavy with thorny foliage throughout all months of the year, 
droop overhead, nearly within arms reach. Sheets of thick, old 
bark, swarming with knots and whorls, are wrapped about the pines 
and firs here like primeval armour, split with age. Thick, 
twiggy brambles and nettles flank the archaic trunks of nearby 
trees, lying in wait to snag the feet of unwary passers-by. 
   In every visible bearing the dense Druadan carries on. To the 
northeast the slight bend of a sheer hill can be spied.

Within the Druadan, Near a Hill's Western Slope~
   Bulky firs are quite common throughout this stretch of the 
woodland, twisted boughs lifting crowns of needlelike foliage 
well above the earth at a dizzying height. Massive pines, 
centuries old, dominate the forest landscape, their warped, 
rough-shod arms and stocky trunks screening ones view. The wide 
roots of the ancient trees that protrude above the forest floor 
here are slick with mould and crawling with moss. Throughout the 
landscape, the towering, ponderous evergreens of the Druadan 
loom, their bristling frames drooping with age. The atmosphere 
here is a heavy, oppressive soup, swimming with stray motes of 
dust and dander. 
   The terrain slopes upward noticeably to the east where a tall, 
rocky hill of grey stone begins its ascent. In all other 
directions, the forest stretches on as densely as usual.

Beneath the Broad Canopy of the Deep Druadan~
   Spruces are especially common here, their long trunks wrapped 
in bushy, conic cloaks of blue-green needles, their lowest boughs 
drooping downward at man-height. Towering firs loom over the 
landscape, the forest ground peppered with dry cones that have 
fallen from their gnarled limbs. The landscape here undulates 
severely at times, rising swiftly into rocky hillocks before 
plunging down into deep gullies. Ancient evergreens grow in 
legion throughout the woodland, their knotted bodies and wiry 
boughs thick, bulky, and sheathed in scabrous bark. Whether at 
the peak of day, or the deep of night, the Druadan is only ever 
dimly illuminated, its bristling canopy absorbing nearly all 
light from above. 
   To the southeast, a tall, wooded hill crests the treeline, 
barely visible from this vantage. The woodland continues as far 
as the eye can see.

Deep Within the Druadan Woodland~
   Mountainous firs and pines rise in dense thickets throughout 
the woodland, tall trunks ribbed and knotted, and sheathed in 
stony bark. Thick, grimy roots creep outward in webs from the 
bases of surrounding trees, burrowing in and out of the black 
earth. Sickly grey fungus stipples the surfaces of fallen trees 
here, spreading over the dying wood like a death shroud. Bushy 
mantles of prickly foliage cloak the weighty spruces that grow 
here, their long needles a silvery blue-green in hue. 
Tightly-woven traceries of thorny-leaved ivy hang from the tree 
boughs in view, spotted with white flowers in the warmer months 
of the year. 
   To the north, east, and south, the forest expands. To the 
west the treeline thickens.

Amidst the Evergreens of the Druadan~
   Lofty pines, bulky spruces and colossal firs grow side by side 
in close proximity throughout the surrounding woodland. Thick 
blankets of dark green moss swathe the broad trunks of the 
Druadan's ancient evergreens, and pad the ground underfoot in 
heavy patches. Shafts of light, either from the sun at day, or 
the stars at night, cut through gaps in the high canopy above, 
illuminating the primeval Druadan in a murky glow. Ranks of 
trees rise proudly here in every direction, their low-hanging 
boughs intersecting above to choke out the sky. The atmosphere 
here is charged with the nose-tickling scent of pine, and the 
rich aroma of damp earth. 
   The forest presses on in all directions, growing notably 
denser to the west.

   Although a variety of trees may be spied in the surrounding 
woodland, spruce, fir and pine seem to dominate, their ponderous 
forms bristling with verdant, evergreen needles. The forest 
floor here is littered with fallen needles and other dry foliage, 
which soften ones step. The land here is remarkably uneven, 
furrowed with trenches and frowning with broad ridges of 
lichen-strewn grey limestone. Broad pine trees rise in great 
number here, the length of their lofty trunks teeming with 
gnarled branches and slender shoots. With every strong gust of 
wind the aged trees here creak and groan, as if to converse with 
one another in low, mournful tones. 
   The woodland stretches on for leagues to the west, and a short 
distance to the north, where it begins to thin.

Floating in the Waters of a Muddy Lake~
   The cloudy waters of a shallow lake gently ripple here, its 
surface bobbing with buoyed debris from the woodland about it. 
The water is often lukewarm, cooling significantly only in the 
winter season. Though the lake swarms with dusty silt, it is not 
completely opaque - in some places the lake bottom can be spied 
below, murky and distorted. Fat winged flies and slender, jet 
black fish skip along and skim the water's surface, ever out of 
reach. Submersion in the lake is far from refreshing or 
comfortable - small particles of dirt and detritus whorl and eddy 
about the body with each movement, brushing roughly and 
unpleasantly against the skin.

translucent green, waft up from the lakebed and float suspended 
in the lake's murky midst. Visibility is low here, the cloudy 
water obscuring sight, and absorbing most rays of light from the 
airy world above.

Inside a Dilapidated Barn~
   The broad enclosure of a dilapidated barn unfolds here, the 
packed dirt floor strewn with sheaves of straw, splinters of 
wood, shards of metal, and other bits of long discarded rubbish. 
The wooden walls that enclose the space are knotted and whorled 
and in a terrible state of decay. Two large, overturned barrels 
lie in the northwestern corner of the barn floor, their bottoms 
flecked with seeds of grain, and their metal bands loose and 
tarnished. Moth-eaten sacks of burlap, dusty and empty, rest in 
a heap near the rusty-hinged doorway, half-trodden into the dirt. 
A cavernous wooden loft lines the eastern wall, a thickly 
knotted, slightly fraying rope dangling from its edge.

noisily with each significant movement. The sloped barn ceiling

On Windswept Foothills, Nearing a Cliff to the South~
   The landscape churns here, rolling in a series of high and 
rocky hills. The deep gullies between the foothills in this 
stretch of terrain are tree-filled and teeming with vegetation. 
To the west, the foothills taper off into increasingly even 
ground, eventually meeting with the southern bulk of the Druadan 
Forest. Northward, eastward and southward the hilly land extends 
for a significant distance. In the latter direction, the 
foothills end at a sheer cliff that marks the roots of a great 
mountain of chalky limestone, which towers above the horizon in 
that direction, capped with snow.

   A mountainous hill rises underfoot here, its skyward climb 
ending at a great, sheer cliff of limestone. The cliff itself 
sweeps upward for some distance, curling back into the roots of a 
colossal mountain. The ground below is rocky and bare, the stony 
earthy swept with a thin layer of dusty soil. The cliff face to 
the south frowns with great crags and deep ridges - these offer 
potential footholds, though any attempt to conquer the bluff 
would not be without trial. Northward the terrain here quickly 
descends before rising swiftly again into long a series of hills, 
similar in appearance and composition to this one.

   A large slab of stone protrudes from the otherwise sheer face 
of the cliff here, looming precipitously above the distant ground 
below. The rocky shelf is sharply ridged, beaten hard by the 
elements. Upward the cliff continues to climb, growing 
significantly steeper and showing no signs of visible footholds. 
Downward a route can be carefully picked along the more craggy 
stretches of the bluff, the crest of a rocky hill waiting below. 
Northward lies a captivating view of distant wilderland - a 
series of foothills roll forth in that direction, soon devoured 
by the foreboding depths of the Druadan Forest. There is a 
narrow gap within the cliff wall toward one edge of the shelf 
here.

limestone, chalky white and flecked with grey. The passageway 
has been roughly scraped through the rock - though its northern 
lengths appear to have been naturally formed, its southern 
extension seems to have been man-made. The air here is dingy, 
dusty and oppressive - northward, however, where the the tunnel

scraped outward and shaped by some ancient method. Stalactites 
cling to the roof of the cavern like icicles, their tips 
glistening with cloudy water. Massive stalagmites rise like 
columns from the ground below, their edges frowning with deep 
grooves. The soupy air here is swirling with motes of dust and 
echoes every sound from any corner of the cavern, the most common 
being the steady drip of water from the roof overhead into 
shallow pools beneath. Though the cavern floor is largely 
uneven, it appears to have been levelled to the west, where a 
great, square hallway has been burrowed into its stony wall. 
Northward a narrow tunnel extends, flanked on either side by 
great pillars of rock.

is quite long and lofty, the roof above bumpy and uneven. The 
ground underfoot is dusted with a layer of chalk which clings to

debris, from roughly-rounded pebbles to minute shards of bone, 
the latter grinding noisily underfoot. Dust hangs suspended in

tomb is roughly rectangular in shape. A seat of stone has been 
carved out of the bare western wall, facing the great mound of 
rubble that slopes upward to the east, barring swift travel in 
that bearing. A massive coffin of rock rests before the seat, 
and beneath the great dombed roof of the tomb above. The curved

spilling into deep gullies and narrow gorges. No plants have 
found purchase on the bleak and rocky ground that rises and falls 
steadily underfoot. Even the slender valleys that are 
overshadowed by the landscape's rolling hills here stand a 
considerable height, the air thin and crisp from the altitude. 
In no direction do the hills abate - westward they grow more

south, a particularly bulky hill of chalky limestone rises - a 
quarry has been cut into its base, visible from the loftier 
hilltops of the surrounding terrain.

Floating in Clear Water Within a Quarry~

man-made basin here, extending for some distance in every 
direction. The water is remarkably pure, no hint of dust or soil 
obscuring its depths. The bottom of the basin is plainly visible

unquarried limestone of the mountainous hillside. Eastward, the 
top of the basin rises at an angle more accommodating to travel, 
folding slowly into a flat stretch of dry, elevated ground.

Submerged in a Clear Pool~
   Clear water, startlingly transparent, extends in every bearing 
here. The water rests in a broad basin, the floor of which lies 
just beneath. Rounded blocks of thinly-veined limestone comprise 
the ground below, seemingly thrown down from a considerable 
height. The calm pool seems devoid of life - no fish plumb its 
depths, and the sheer walls that surround it bear no signs of 
algae or other common aquatic growth. The surface of the pool 
hangs high above, the wide sky, slightly distorted, visible 
beyond. Northward, two large blocks of overturned limestone 
obscure a large portion of the smooth wall in that direction.

An Abandoned Quarry, Near a Pool of Clear Water~
   The surrounding landscape converges here at the base of a 
particularly large and bulky hill to the west. A significant 
portion of the hill's lower lengths has been bored into deeply, 
the limestone roots levelled flat to form a broad quarry. 
Westward, the deepest portion of the quarry lies, the 
curve-walled basin filled near to the brim with water of 
exceptional clarity. Northward and eastward the boundaries of 
the quarry end as rougher terrain ranges in either direction. 
Southward, the terrain declines swiftly into a narrow valley, 
abandoned and overgrown, before steeply rising again to meet the 
sheer face of Mount Mindolluin and other outlying peaks.

A Damp, Subterranean Cavern~
   Smooth limestone walls twist and warp to form the boundaries 
of this subterranean cavern. The space is more than a little 
cramped the ceiling of the cavern hangs low overhead, and dips 
steeply in some areas to completely obstruct ones movement. The 
floor underfoot, comprised of the same grainy, grey-white 
limestone that domes the cave, is slick with perspiration, 
offering only a few stable footholds. Southward, the wet floor 
spills downward to meet a pool of crystal clear water, which 
extends for some space in that direction and passes under the lip 
of the caverns southernmost wall.

Inside of a Wooden Palisade~
   Once inside the gates, the ground looks as if it has been 
cleared of any debris or wildlife that might have once grown 
here. The surrounding wall is made of logs that have been dug 
into the ground and sharpened at the top. The center of this 
area is dominated by a sturdy wooden cabin. Often the camp 
buzzes with activity during daytime while at night, sounds of 
wild creatures and insects hang in the air.

A Damp, Noisome Cave Beneath the Hills~
   The shifting of some ancient watercourse in a past age left 
this wide grotto nestled under the hills, hidden from daylight. 
It retains a glistening, clinging dampness that has given rise to 
great growths of slime and fungi upon the walls, and the uneven 
floor is studded with shallow, mineral-crusted pools of water. 
Rounded, lumpish boulders litter the place and the paler hues of 
chalky bones, many split or gnawed to rounded nubs, show in many 
places.

A Break in the Thorns~
   Thorns and underbrush suddenly give way to this small, 
semicircular depression in the forest floor. Long ago, a spring 
bubbled to the surface here, perhaps giving rise to a small 
brook, but centuries of silt and forest detritus have swallowed 
the waters once more, leaving no more signs of them then a low, 
marshy patch near the center of the clearing. Leaning in from 
all sides, the moss-hung limbs of squat old trees encase the sky 
above, reducing it to a few fractured angles above and preventing 
all but the strongest of winds from reaching this place.

A Stone-Walled Storage Cellar~
   Wide stone stairs lead down into this cellar from the kitchen. 
The walls are made of stone, while the floor is made of stone. 
Various containers line the edges of the room. The room is dimly 
lit by a few candles set in sconces on the walls, though much of 
the room remains shadowed. The air here is dry. At the northern 
edge of the room is a heavy door with a narrow shutter in it, and 
heavy bolts on this side of it.

wall. A heavy, reinforced door stands in the southern wall, 
leading out of the cell, but elsewhere there is no prospect of 
escape; the walls and floor are constructed of well-cut stone. 
The air here is somewhat dry. A couple of sleeping mats lie in 
the floor, provided minimal comfort.

A Moderately-Sized Stable~
   This building functions as the fort's stables. It is longer 
east-west than it is north-south, and the horse stalls are along 
the longer walls. The floor is made of hard-packed dirt, and the 
path running along between the stalls is wide enough to 
accommodate a cart. There is an odor hanging in the air, of 
horses and their feed. Well-cut stone makes up the lower six 
foot or so of both the northern and eastern walls, while the 
remainder of the building is made of logs. In the northwest 
corner of the room a spiraling wooden staircase leads up to the 
next level, while at the western end of the southern wall there 
is an opening, leading to a training room.

been laid out in the northeast corner, and a sparring ring takes 
up much of the rest of the room. A small archery range has been 
set up along the western end of the hall, the targets at the 
southern end. The southern and eastern walls of this room are 
mostly stone, while the remainder is made of logs. The floor

A Large Barracks~
   This room can be accessed from the stables below by spiraling 
wooden stairs. Occasionally the smell of horses wafts up, though 
it is not unbearable. In the northwest corner is a trapdoor 
which can be reached by climbing a ladder. Along the east and 
west walls are bunk beds. Placed on the floor between the rows 
of bunk beds is a long, sky blue rug. Wooden logs form the walls 
here. A sturdy door is set in the wall to the west, leading out 
onto a wooden walkway, and on either side of it are two archers' 
slits. Due to the sparseness of the natural light, candles set 
in wall sconces are used to light the room.

with various cupboards and racks around it, and all the usual 
kitchen necessities. There is a fireplace at the northern end of 
the room. The western and southern walls are partly stone, 
partly wood, while the northern and eastern walls are both made 
of logs. In the northwest corner of the waxed wooden floor is 
set a wide, heavy trapdoor. A very small, shuttered window in 
the upper part of the east wall allows a little natural light in.

A Crenellated, Covered Wooden Walkway~
   This walkway runs between the two buildings. It is of sturdy 
construct, able to support a great deal of weight. At the east 
and west ends, the buildings can be accessed through two sturdy 
doors, while the north and south sides have thick wooden 
crenellations, reminiscent of a stone fort. The entire walkway 
is covered by a triangular roof, which helps a little to fend off 
the elements and protects archers from indirect shots at them 
while still giving them room to shoot out. To the north 
stretches the Lond Anorien and the countryside on either side of 
it, while not far to the south is Milton. The walkway also 
overlooks the part of the road which runs through the small fort, 
and has murder holes which allow anything directly beneath it to 
be harmed.

   This room almost certainly functions as the fort's armoury, 
given the nature of the contents of the various containers lining 
the walls. The room isn't overly large, and only a handful of 
people would be able to fit into what floor-space there is 
between the storage areas. Several lanterns around the walls 
keep the room lit when necessary. The door is somewhat heavier 
than usual, and on either side of it is an archer's slit.

   This room appears to function as both a common room and a 
dining room. The western and northern walls are mostly 
constructed of stone, though the top parts are made of logs, as 
are the eastern and southern walls, while the floor is also 
wooden. A single, small, shuttered window in the eastern wall, 
at the southern end, lets in light otherwise the room is usually 
lit by the fireplace built into the southern wall and by candles 
set in brackets around it. Chairs are dotted around the northern 
part of the room, and long tables are set by the western wall, 
perpendicular to it. A door to the south leads into a kitchen. 
Spiraling wooden stairs are set in the northwest corner.

A Sizeable Wooden Barracks Room~
   Spiraling wooden stairs lead up into this room from below, and 
a ladder in the northeast corner leads to a trapdoor. Two rows 
of bunk beds placed perpendicular to the east and west walls are 
the main feature of the room. There is a long, sky blue rug 
placed on the floor between the rows of beds, and apart from that 
the room is bare. The walls are constructed of wooden logs, 
which help to insulate the room in cold weather. At the eastern 
side of the room, near the ladder, is a sturdy door, and on 
either side of it are two archers' slits. Only a very small 
amount of light comes through those, so the room relies on the 
candles set in wall-sconces for light.

   This small room functions as both a study and a bedroom. It 
is constructed in a similar manner to the rest of the building; 
the floor is wooden and the walls have been made of logs. A desk 
stands facing the door, and hanging from the wall behind the desk 
is a sky blue banner bearing a rising sun. Near the eastern edge 
of the room is set a partition, and behind it are a cupboard and 
a bed. Shelves line part of the western wall. A small window 
high up in the northwest corner of the room lets in a little 
light, and at night the room is lit with candles set in sconces 
or the lantern hanging by the door if necessary.

A Fortified Platform~
   Set on top of the fort's western building, this flat platform 
has a magnificent view of the surrounding countryside. A wooden, 
shingled, pyramid-like roof rises to a point above the centre 
platform, offering limited protection from the elements and from 
projectiles from above. The entire rooftop is surrounded by 
battlements, made of wood but sturdy enough to stop an arrow with 
ease.

Wooden Fortifications Overlooking Anorien~
   A vast amount of land can be seen from this position on top of 
the fort's eastern building. The Anduin is just visible many 
miles to the east. Sheltering the wide platform is a 
pyramid-like roof, covered in slates, which provides some 
protection from rain, snow and arrows, though this is still 
exposed to the elements. Below the edges of the roof and around 
the platform are battlements, offering more protection from 
arrows for anyone stationed up here, while still allowing them to 
shoot back easily.

Inside a Huge Green Pavilion~
   This extremely large, linen-covered pavilion is supported by 
four stout poles. During daylight hours an appliqued emblem on 
the outside wall stands in dark contrast against the otherwise 
leaf-green-tinged light shed here. A series of hung lanterns 
provide illumination at night, while during the day a shaft of 
light shines through the entrance to the pavilion, offering a 
glimpse of the Great West Road beyond. 
   Filled with Marchwardens and soldiers, this tent is a bustling 
and noisy base for the encampment surrounding it. A runner is 
usually on hand to contact the Wardenry. Simply "#Bsend

   This hastily erected platform is little more than a series of 
split logs lashed together with cording and pinned with a few 
rough, wooden pegs. Hugging the wall of the palisade in several 
segments, it gives those who balance up here a view over the 
rough log wall of the fortifications. 
   Those of able body could easily make the quick scramble over
the top of the palisade wall to drop to the earth in the country-
side surrounding the fort.

On a Dirt Trail Amidst the Fields of Anorien ~
   On occasion the encompassing fieldland is grooved with low, 
craggy escarpments, their sloped limestone faces overrun with 
growth. Few wild trees grow in the surrounding grassland, but 
those that do, though usually spare and thin, are easy to spot. 
The land here is cloaked in a dense carpet of grasses, ranging 
variously in type and colour. Small shrubs, and a variety of 
woody vegetation sprinkle the region, growing in close thickets 
over the flatland. Tall hawthorns, bristling with thorny 
branches and pale green foliage, bloom with spotted white flowers 
across the grassland here in fairer seasons. The trail meanders 
eastwards curving gently to the south.

A Trail Through the Cultivated Anorien Grassland~
   Several low, broad hillocks add a depth to this otherwise flat 
stretch of countryside, rising and falling in gentle waves across 
the land. Herbaceous milkwort bushes thrive in the grassy 
landscape alongside other vegetation here, blooming purple in 
most months of the year. A variety of wild herbs, from cowslip 
to sorrel, prosper here in the dank, fertile soil of the 
grassland. Scattered about, fenced rectangular plots can be seen 
in the tamer corners of the encircling grassland, tended and 
tilled by resident farmers. Rough sheets of granite and 
limestone occasionally crest the lush meadow turf of this region, 
weeds crawling over their exposed stony surfaces.

The Fields of North Anduin Near the Shore of the Great Anduin~
   The grassy stalks of the surrounding countryside quiver and 
rustle with every stiff gust of wind, their roots running deep 
into the dark, arable soil of the land here. Human feet have 
created a small number of paths through a few portions the 
fields, the sodden passages weaving off toward distant buildings 
and small, tilled meadows. Houses, barns, and other wooden 
structures are scattered about the surrounding grassland, plainly 
visible from the proper vantage. A handfull of small farms 
spring randomly here, fairly well tended by the inhabitants 
throughout the year, and most of them bordered by low, knotted 
fences. A firm, wide trail runs east and west as it crosses the 
farmed landscape. The sound of the flowing water of a wide river 
rumbles softly across the fields.

Along the West Shore of the River Anduin Above a Wooden Dock~
   With a slight westward curve, the River Anduin keeps to the 
western bank, flowing alongside in an easy, fluid manner. Easily 
sloping underwater, the dirt mixed sand is lapped by the swiftly 
moving river. From the water's edge, the bank extends the width 
of twenty feet or so to the west, rising slightly. The bank 
breaks suddenly into thin, knee-high grass which waves with the 
movement of the air about it, beyond which, the fertile fields of 
Anorien lie. Small animals dart in and out of the grass, leave 
tracks in the mud and then disappear as quickly as they appeared. 
To the east a huge island of rock rises from the depths of the 
river, its peak standing taller then the forests of Ithilien that 
are visible on the distant eastern bank of the river. 
   The way to the east stops before the bank of the Anduin, 
barred by a high stone wall and a gatehouse. Carriages come here 
and drop off visitors from Minas Tirith and Anorien, or take 
parties to the other areas of Gondor.

   Where fully exposed, the grassy stalks of the surrounding 
countryside quiver and rustle with every stiff gust of wind. The 
dark soil of the land here is plainly arable and largely pure, 
bearing only a sparse scattering of white-flecked pebbles and 
other detritus. Human feet have trod a network of paths through 
the fields, the sodden passages weaving off toward distant 
buildings and small, tilled meadows. Houses, barns, and other 
wooden structures freckle the surrounding grassland, plainly 
visible from the proper vantage. Little farms spring up at

year, and bordered by low, knotted fences. A firm, wide trail 
leads northwards veering to the east as it crosses the farmed 
landscape and southwards towards the main highway.

A Murky Pool Meets an Underground River~
   As the water-filled shaft continues further down into the 
earth, any signs of light quickly fade in the murky water. At 
its bottom it meets a horizontal tunnel which directs a 
subterranean river southwest to northwest. The water becomes 
turbulent as the relatively still water from the shaft meets the 
rushing river water.

   Half of this dark chamber is sunk in a murky underground river 
which flows in through a cramped black tunnel in the southeastern 
wall and exits through a similar tunnel in the northwest. At the 
highest point of the cavern's ceiling the outline of a trapdoor 
formed from stone might be visible. A similar stone door, on the 
cave's northern side, rests on the floor. To the northeast a 
slope of moist dirt rises up to the ceiling where a small hole, 
which could possibly be entered, might allow a weak beam of light 
to penetrate and dimly illuminate the chamber.

At the Base of a Time-Worn Waterfall~
   Pouring down from the high peaks of the White Mountains, this 
waterfall, cut into the smoothed, grey stone, pours down into a 
rock outcropping that lies on the slopes of the rocky foothills. 
Off to the north, the hills creep down into the thick stand of 
trees that make up the Forest Druadan. The peaks to the south 
are sheer, preventing passage. Although too worn now, the stone 
of the waterfall looks as though the more jagged stones once 
might have served as suitable footholds for climbing.

the thick air, filled with a stagnant, moist feeling. The water 
of the river begins to steadily grow more filled with dirt.

   The craggy woodland ground is broken by a mazy network of 
sinuous roots, which radiate outward from the nearby evergreens 
in every direction. Particles of dust and pollen swirl through 
the woodland air, adding to the forest's oppressive atmosphere. 
An assortment of ferns and weeds carpet the forest floor during 
most months of the year, their leathery foliage ranging widely in 
colour. Lofty pines droop in all directions here like eerie 
sentinels, their short boughs laden heavily with thorny growth. 
Dewy cobwebs lie on much of the vegetation here throughout most 
months of the year, gleaming silver even in low light.

The broad, twisted limbs of the Druadan's ancient evergreens sag
overhead, bristling with spiky growth and laden with pinecones.
A rock-ribbed landscape churns below the lofty treeline, flinty
promontories and rocky fingers peeking often through the 
underbrush. Broad ferns with leathery, jagged-edged fronds grow 
aside spiny nettles and other vegetation here, thriving in the
deep shade. Thick, grimy roots creep outward in webs from the
bases of surrounding trees, burrowing in and out of the black
earth.

Within the Druadan, Near a Hill's Eastern Slope~
   Shafts of light, either from the sun at day, or the stars at 
night, cut through gaps in the high canopy above, illuminating 
the primeval Druadan in a murky glow. A network of winding paths 
has been cut through the ground underfoot here by the local 
wildlife, twisting with the rise and fall of the terrain. Ridges 
of murky grey limestone rise and fall here, adding a wild, 
unpredictable depth to the forest landscape. The scraping of 
gnarled boughs and groaning of bending wood resounds with every 
strong gust of wind here, though the air between the broad frames 
of the encircling trees is most often still. Lofty pines, bulky 
spruces and colossal firs grow side by side in close proximity 
throughout the surrounding woodland. 
   To the west frowns the rock-bound eastern slope of a high 
stone hill.

shoots. Sheets of thick, old bark, swarming with knots and 
whorls, are wrapped about the pines and firs here like primeval 
armour, split with age. The atmosphere here buzzes with muted 
sounds, from the humming of insects to the supernal crowing of 
distant birds. High above, the massive crowns of Druadan's 
towering trees meet, their bushy green boughs forming a nearly 
impenetrable canopy. The forest floor here is littered with 
fallen needles and other dry foliage, which soften ones step.

Among the Evergreens of the Druadan~
   The wide roots of the ancient trees that protrude above the 
forest floor here are slick with mould and crawling with moss. 
The rare dead or dying tree can be spied amongst the old, but 
vibrant forest life here, their leafless and skeletal frames 
plainly perceptible. The landscape of the Druadan is rarely flat 
and even; shelves of rock, mostly limestone and granite, thrust 
up through the earth at intervals, forming mossy escarpments and 
low ridges. The steady drone of insects hidden from view amongst 
the dense brush pervades this stretch of the forest. Bulky firs 
are quite common throughout this stretch of the woodland, twisted 
boughs lifting crowns of needlelike foliage well above the earth 
at a dizzying height.

   Ancient evergreens grow in legion throughout the woodland, 
their knotted bodies and wiry boughs thick, bulky, and sheathed 
in scabrous bark. The occasional rocky crag emerges through the 
earthen woodland floor, grey limestone faces freckled with blood 
red lichen. The scent of sweet pine, exhaled by the woods many 
evergreens, pervades the senses here strongly. Rangy shrubs 
bearing a variety of thorny vegetation are scattered throughout 
this stretch of the woodland. Towering firs loom over the 
landscape, the forest ground peppered with dry cones that have 
fallen from their gnarled limbs.

Deep Amid the Druadan Wood~
   Sickly grey fungus stipples the surfaces of fallen trees here, 
spreading over the dying wood like a death shroud. The broad, 
twisted limbs of the Druadan's ancient evergreens sag overhead, 
bristling with spiky growth and laden with pinecones. A vast 
dome of needlelike growth, lush and verdant even in winter, 
crowns the Druadan here and nearly completely blots out the sky 
above. Muggy air envelopes this stretch of the woodland, tinged 
with the odour of rotten wood and soil. Mountainous firs and 
pines rise in dense thickets throughout the woodland, tall trunks 
ribbed and knotted, and sheathed in stony bark. 
   Northward the forest gradually thins, though to the east, 
south and west it expands as densely as usual.

   Drifting ideally underneath the ancient bridge, the river,

Behind a Screen of Rushing Water~
   A torrent of water falls down from somewhere up above, 
creating a mirror of a thousand sparkling droplets that hides 
this large hollow of grey rock behind the waterfall. Large, grey 
boulders are scattered here, pulled down and smoothed now, in 
contrast from the jagged stones on the other side, from high 
above by the raw power of the water, ferns and other plant life 
taken root in the gaps. High above, a separate ledge can be seen 
jutting out to almost touch the cascade. Pools of water have 
collected in abundance here and leak through cracks and streams 
into the main body of water below. 
   A dark cave, large enough to accommodate wanderers in single 
file, opens up to the south. A small trail leads around the 
waterfall northwards and back to the Druadan forest.

A Damp, Bone Littered Cave~
   Skeletons are scattered across the floor of this cave, the 
smaller bones crunch easily underfoot. A faint faint, musty, 
animal smell lingers in the air and becomes more apparent as the 
cave opens up into a larger space. Pools of water have formed in 
some places and drain away through cracks and gullies, leaving 
sand and dirt where little plant life grows. The back of the 
cave is dryer caused by the the slight incline. A few rocks can 
be found on the floor and a large boulder rests against the grey 
stone wall to the west. 
   The sounds of water falling echo all about this cave.

rags~
   Peering closer at the pile of rags reveals a human skull, the 
back of which is completely missing. Closer inspection of the 
area around the skull reveals more bones of less animal looking 
origin. 
~

skeletons~
   A closer inspection of the skeletons reveal them to be mostly 
of animal origin, quite old, and are marred and notched in 
several places, most likely by whatever killed them. A pile of 
dirty rags is also present amongst the bones.

A Rocky Outcrop~
   A slab of smoothed, grey rock juts out from the cave mouth to 
the south, almost touching the torrent of water from the 
waterfall that cascades from above. Looking over the edge of the 
slab, a clear view of the path leading behind the waterfall and 
to the mouth of the entrance to this cave system below can easily 
be seen, whilst concealing any would-be ambushers that may choose 
to take advantage of this position. Ferns and other foliage 
cling to the wet rock of the cave mouth.

An Echoing Cave within Draug S'am~
   The sound of water echoes loudly about this cave, making it 
difficult to hear anything below a shout. Spanning roughly five 
men standing abreast from the west side to the eastern, and 
allowing most men to stand easily. The walls of this cave are a 
grey-granite in color, quite smooth and dry. The floor is 
covered in crisp hay atop a layer of sand and dirt. 
   The cave continues west, northwards a fresh breeze can be 
felt. A narrow shaft leads back down a steep incline.

A Winding Passage~
   Narrow and winding from east to south, this passage would 
allow two men to stand abreast with ease. The ceiling drops 
occasionally, providing the incautious with a nasty bump if they 
are not careful. The walls have a water-smoothed look, though 
the tunnel is quite dry. Crisp hay covers the sand and dirt 
floor and crunches underfoot. 
   To the east, the roar of the waterfall can be heard. 
Southwards the tunnel becomes wider.

A Winding Passage Opening to a Larger Cave~
   The cave system opens up here into a wide, smooth walled 
cavern. The ceiling slopes upwards slightly to about double the 
height of a man and continues towards the south. Hay is strewn 
over the ground, with a layer sand and dirt covering the stone 
underneath. The walls are smoothed, yet cracked in places, as if 
a great torrent of water had passed through over the course of 
years. 
   The cave is lined with torches, lighting the area in dim, 
flickering torchlight. The exit to the south is blocked by a 
barricade of logs.

A Dry Floored Opening in the Rock~
   Narrowing from the north and developing back into a thinner 
tunnel, this area of the cave system would allow perhaps two men 
to walk abreast and branches three directions. The walls 
continue their smoothness that is found elsewhere and the floor 
is covered with hay, over a layer of dirt and sand. The tunnel 
is lined with sconces, each holding a flickering torch. 
   The tunnel continues west and north and to the east, the floor 
and walls become rougher, jagged rocks are just visible in the 
flickering firelight.

A Short Passage~
   A short, narrow passage leads to a split in several 
directions, and is lit by torches lining the walls. The ground 
is covered with hay and the walls have been smoothed, though 
contain cracks here and there. 
   Rough hewn exits lead off from this room to the north, south 
and west.

A Makeshift Barracks and Mess Hall~
   This cave has been made larger and extended further north into 
a makeshift barracks of a sort. Sleeping mats line the edges of 
the room and have been arranged into lines, allowing people to 
move about easily. Hammocks have been hung here and there and 
supported by wooden beams that have been shorn up underneath the 
roof to prevent caveins. 
   A small alcove to the west has cut off from the barracks by a 
hide curtain.

are smooth and occasionally lined with cracks and small crevices. 
Overturned boxes and crates have been placed in the center of the 
the cave. On a particularly smooth part of the northern wall, a 
rough map has been etched into the rock. 
   To the west of the cave, a number of crates and boxes have 
been stacked up. Eastwards leads back to a short passage.

A Small Hide Overlooking the Road to the East~
   A small tunnel has been dug out of the earth of the hill. 
Grass roots and stone poke out of the walls and ceiling, where 
wooden supports have been shored up to make the hide more sturdy 
and safe. Hey is strewn across the floor, removing some of the 
damp in this space that could allow two average sized humans to 
inhabit. 
   A grass cover to the east looks out over the Great West Road, 
whilst another exits onto the western facing side of a hill, 
covering those who would use it from eyes on the road.

Cramped Main Room of a Stone Building~
   Spartan and dull, even the gray of the stone bears the look of 
monotony. Evenly carved and perfectly squared, this room is 
well-crafted despite its bare furnishing and dreary looks. The 
room is somewhat stuffy as the air seems to have very poor 
circulation, but a slight draft can be felt coming from above 
where a small trap-door is led to by a rickety wooden ladder. 
   Within the doorways to the other rooms, no doors are hung save 
in the doorway to the south where a heavy granite door has been 
fashioned.

Atop a Stone Turret~
   Dominating the top of this turret is a great stack of wood 
which has been soaked thoroughly with a very hearty dose of oil. 
Placed several yards away, several torches are always kept lit 
and at the ready should danger arise, demanding this turret be 
lit to call to arms the defenses of Gondor. 
   Looking outward, one might notice that they reside atop the 
high reaches of the slopes of Eilenach, house to one of the 
beacon fires of Gondor. Deep within the Druadan Forest, a 
commanding view of the dark forest is offered by this old, 
weathered fortification.

Within a Cramped Kitchen~
   Tiny even by comparison to the main room, this kitchen would 
allow for only the storage of food and the stove which has been 
positioned in the corner. Carved into the walls are shelves to 
alleviate some of the closeness of this room, but it is quite 
apparent this structure, carved from the gray gneiss, was not 
intended to be welcoming; merely a functional place for storage 
or preparation of bland food.

A Spartan Living Quarters~
   Lined with only a few pallets for sleeping, this living area 
does not seem it could comfortably house more than half a dozen

that it would not provide suitable habit even with ample space. 
The room is stuffy and there is no circulation or air movement in 
the slightest.

A Flame-Lit Entry To An Underground Burrow~
   Torchs carrying flame are set in a pair of rusted iron sconces 
at the low entry of this burrow, low enough to cause tall men to 
stoop. The entry is rather narrow, with a hard-packed earthen 
floor and stone-ridden walls. Timber has been strutted in places 
to reinforce and strengthen the burrow. It starts to widen and 
grow taller the further one descends into the burrow.

   The burrow descends down as it lengthens westwards, opening up 
wider and wider, and leading into an underground hall. The 
ground is formed of hard-packed earth, loose dust and dirt built 
up on the surface. Rusted iron sconces are driven into the 
stone-ridden walls, holding flame-laden torchs in order to cast 
the burrow in a dim flickering light. Lengths of timber and logs 
have been placed in strategic places to reinforce and strengthen 
the earthen ceilings and walls of the burrow.

A Spacious, Flame-Lit Underground Hall~
   Smudged and stained with the residue of smoke, this great 
underground hall has clearly hosted many a bonfire. Prominent in 
the large chamber is a gigantic, stone-ringed firepit bearing 
heaps of ash and surrounded by a variety of seating ranging from 
stumps and logs to stones and stools. The hard-packed dirt 
ground is stained a blackish grey from all of the ash that has 
been stamped into it. A smoky smell clings to the air, and warm 
light is cast about from a series of rusted iron sconces that 
have been thrust into crannies of the stone-ridden walls. A long 
swathe of tattered cloth curtains off a small way to the west 
that enlarges into another cavern, while a well-traveled ramp 
inclines to lead one up and out of the hall.

A Dark And Musty Sleeping Cavern~
   Dark and musty, this cavern has been hollowed out from the 
earth, thick wooden beams placed strategically to brace and 
strengthen the walls and stone-ridden ceiling. The ground is of 
hard-packed dirt, and spread out amongst the caverns floor are 
varied rudimentary sets of sleeping arrangements. Little light 
is shed in the cavern, with a solitary torch set within a nook in 
the wall spreading a fickle wavering glow. A long series of 
tattered curtains is hung over the narrowed way from the main 
hall, dampening noise produced on the other side of the mangy 
cloth.
