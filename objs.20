A shining, silver medal with a crossed sword and spear lies here.~
   Simple in design and craft, this silver medal shines brightly. 
The metal has been shaped into a sword and spear, the former 
crossed over the top of the latter. Etched carefully along the 
length of the blade are four digits, '2479', the sigils flowing 
gently and gracefully. Affixed to the back of this medal is a 
simple pin, allowing the badge to be affixed to an article of 
clothing.

A pair kevlar underpants cut with eyeholes are piled here.~
   This pitch black mass of material is masterfully weaved into a 
protective undergarment. Fashioned out of the highest quality 
kevlar, it would prove protective against bullets and the weather 
alike. Cut and sitched into either side of the piece are two 
almond-shaped holes, indistinct in their purpose.

A gigantic piece of still space debris float here, commanding gravity.~
   Made up of little more than rocks, this large cluster has 
developed to be the central point of this system. The various 
grey and black rocks have melded together to form a single jagged 
mass that rotates slowly in comparison to the sweeping 
revolutions of its appendages.

an ever burning sun~
A swirling ball of ever burning plasma floats here, way off in the distance.~
   The true size of this orb is impossible to discern, as is its 
distance from you. The heat it emits is enough to offset the 
frigid chill of the vacuum, which offers some insight in to its 
power. White at the center, this ball pulses with every shade of 
yellow and orange along with the various darker spots of black 
that scatter along its surface.

The age old capsule of a spaceship float here.~
   This metal husk has not seen the kind side of time, chipped 
and aged. The paint that once coated its metallic surface 
savaged by the numerous contacts it has made in its orbit. Yet 
clear on its side is a red flag that bears a tiny yellow star in 
the far corner, unharmed by time or space. The top hatch of this 
massive capsule is hinged, allowing anyone to pull from its 
contents at will.

   The many bullets lining this red leather belt are its most

in yellow lettering.

A large, flat-topped cooking grill with a hinged lid stands here, ever burning.~
   Made out of dark iron, this charcoal grill stands about four 
feet high at its cooking surface. The charred metal along the 
inside of the hood and the entire cooking grid make apparent that 
it has seen many uses over a prolonged period of time. 
Underneath the grid slumbers a stack of glowing embers that 
radiate intense here should the hood be opened. Set on the face 
of the hood next to the temperature gauge is a little marking 
that bears the words "TilianCo".

Glowing luminously, a gray full moon is suspended here.~
   This massive grey sphere hides an impossible distance away, 
which can be attributed to the lack of nearby objects to offer 
perspective. Marring the surface of this rock is a clear face. 
This face can only be seen if you tilt your head to side and 
squint really hard and strongly resembles the actor Ben Kingsley.
