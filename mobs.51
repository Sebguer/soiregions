a formless liegeman of the Ithilien Battalion is here, lacking form~
   Still wet behind the ears, this youthful liegeman appears as

hand rather than arms of war. None the less, they keep a 
vigilant, if nervous watch on the surrounding land as they tend 
their duties.

A tall, swarthy man stands here~
   Close cropped black hair covers this tall man's head. Coffee 
color eyes cut large round shapes beneath his heavy brow. His 
nose arcs in a hawklike accent over his wide, thin lipped mouth. 
His jaw is strong and his chin square and in need of a shave. 
Broad shoulders taper down to trim hips. His hands are large and 
caloused. His legs strong and long. His skin is the color of 
aged parchment.

A rough-black-furred, one-eyed wolf prowls here.~
   This wolf stands just a little higher than average for its 
species, reaching to about a Man's hip. A single intelligent eye 
gazes out at the world, the other scarred shut. Rough black fur 
mats its muscular body, though in some places scars push back the 
hair. Its tail is fairly long, its teeth sharper than the finest 
dagger, powerful jaws moving with the easy knowledge of a sure 
kill. Its claws face the world like a protective wall of spikes, 
dangerous in their own right.

muscle rippling beneath.

A fine-haired, large coal stallion stands here, quite tall.~
   Ferociously intelligent eyes of a light brown flecked with 
gold gaze outwards, a streak of mean in the way they regard 
anything. At least 18 hands high, this horse bears a beautiful 
coat of a coal-black color, shining as it covers the rippling 
muscle beneath. Thick, powerful hindquarters and a broad chest 
make this horse seem extremely strong. It is obviously well 
groomed. Heavy hooves stamp at the ground in an eager manner.

Tiny troll jaundiced mane OTTO~
a long maned troll with jaundiced eyes~
A long maned troll with jaundiced eyes looms here.~
   This hulking troll stands at over twelve-feet and is covered 
in hair thick enough to be called fur. Its muscles are 
enormously proportioned, accentuating rogue tufts of white 
follicles around its joints. Its arms are longer than they 
should be and end in thick hands with gnarled and yellowed 
fingernails. There is little neck to speak of beneath its square 
head, which is offset by a lack of ears and lips. Carved by the 
gods of battle, they have long since gone missing beneath the 
rush of steel. Its eyes are jaundiced, edged in pink and red.

a mountainous troll with an iron plate over its eye~
A mountainous Olog-Hai with an iron plate above his right eye, stands here.~
   Rusted and partially overgrown by the creep of flesh, a thick 
metal plate sits in prominence above this troll's right eye. It 
is perhaps the most attractive thing about it as its body is 
covered in open sores and lesions. They weep and ooze a greenish 
puss that has given his blackened skin a lacquered finished. Its 
eyes are tiny pinpricks, almost entirely hidden by eyelids that 
slough atop each other like loose hosiery. It is gigantic, even 
as members of its own species goes, with an enormous belly 
complete with stretch marks and varicose veins.

A stoic man with a raptor-like gaze looms here.~
   Barely topping five-feet, this squat, thick necked man stands 
with a confident turn of his head. His build is stocky, with 
wide shoulders and legs thick as tree trunks. A long brown beard 
flows down to his mid-section, matched in length by two long 
braids from just in front of his ears. His hard face, showing no 
emotion, is cracked and weathered by the echoes of past violence. 
He moves with confidence belied in the raptor-like glint of his 
hazel eyes.

auto-create Plebe Goblin OTTO waits here.~
   A life of hardship is written clearly into this small goblin's 
emaciated body. Scars mare the exposed flesh - grey lines 
standing in stark contrast to its greasy flesh. Red-eyes, clear 
with hate, glare from under a sloping brow. Hands, clawed and 
sporting broken fingernails, hang from boney wrists. While 
appearing half-starved, there is a vibrant desperation evident in 
its quick movements that lend this creature an incongruous degree 
of menace.

auto-create commoner goblin OTTO stands ready.~
   This snaga is hunched over with rounded shoulders and a 
stooped gait. Lanky arms and legs holding barely enough meat to 
be called muscle root it to the ground. Scraggly hair falls down 
over its eyes, hiding their true color behind a veil of umber. 
Its teeth are yellowed and cracked, mirroring the poor hygiene 
that are the hallmarks of its gum line. This vile creature has 
felt its share of hard work and violence and it seems prepared to 
pass on the favor.

   Skin grabs tightly to lanky muscle, pulled over a small frame 
with uncommonly long arms. Its nose is elongated, wide at the 
bridge and thick of nostril. Sunken eyes accentuate the length 
of its skull, seeming to contort the face into something 
raptor-like. Its hand are wiry and yet strong, curling and 
uncurling with each breath. Its scalp can be seen through its 
thinning, greasy hair, which is periodically flaked with 
dandruff. Small and agile, this creature is no stranger to 
danger.

clench and unclench in anxious anticipation.

   Watery blue eyes are set deep in large in this homely 
mongrel's face. Their cheeks are marred by streaks of red from 
the elements or too much drink - it is hard to tell. Brown hair 
in a nest of mousy curls tumbles just below the earlobes, which 
wraps its head in a halo of unkept tangles. Rounded shoulders 
and fatty curves, bespeak a hard life with a terrible diet. 
Though their spirit seems defeated, there is yet anger in its 
eyes.

Haradan elite~
auto-create Haradn Elite RALALAN~
auto-create Haradn Elite RALALAN waits here warily.~
   Geometric scarring, a dark brown against deep caramel skin, 
decorates the well developed cheekbones of this Haradan. Their 
hair is black and closely cropped in martial concern, echoing the 
neatly trimmed and bushy beard below. Its body is broad 
shouldered and thick limbed, muscles hardened by a life of 
physical effort. Calloused hands with thick tendons and 
ligaments twist into the thick muscles of their forearm. They 
walk with confidence and surety.

A tall, black-haired, cloud-grey eyed man stands here.~
   With eyes the color of dark clouds, this man watches 
everything that goes on about him. A muscled body, 
standing ready to react. His face is clean-shaven and 
continually set firm and serious. Dark hair is kept 
cropped short, and orderly. His skin, though fairly 
light, is nevertheless tanned, and many scarred can be 
noted when it is exposed. Bushy black eyebrows sit on 
a high and noble forehead. The man's hands are large 
and heavily scarred. His back is carried straight, the 
wide shoulders proudly squared.

A green-eyed, blond-haired young man is here.~
   This man is rather young, barely out of his teenage years. 
Lithe blonde hair, slightly mussy, careens its way down his head 
and a rather large nose potrudes between two green eyes. His 
thin lips do nothing to compliment the small wisp of a beard he 
attempts to grow. In fact, his entire body seems rather gangly 
and awkward, as if still growing.

A tall, distinguished, silver-haired man with grey eyes stands here~
   Silver hair showing an occasional black strand crowns a regal 
head held erect above a proud, straight back. This man's keen 
grey eyes exhibit an unmistakable intelligence and his entire 
demeanor is one of confidence and competence. His hands show old 
scars typical of a swordsman, yet their callouses are of a type 
associated more with a man who spends long days with a quill. 
Tall and lean, he moves with a fluid elegance.

holander bay wrinkly stallion UniquePOFAowein byPhear Holander~
a long-and-wrinkly necked, bay-coated stallion~
A long-and-wrinkly necked, bay-coated stallion stands here.~
   Standing at roughly 16 hands high, this stallion keeps itself 
in a manner befitting its worn exterior. Its mane and tail are a 
dark black, split-ends and thin hairs jutting out in meandering 
directions. A jagged, dull-pink, scar runs from top of his 
right-front side to about midway down his ribcage, the long-ago 
rough and healed flesh within rising slightly out and above the 
surface. His legs appears sturdy, a white stocking rising from 
his back-left hood to his knee, with several scratches and minor 
scars visible upon his legs and underside. A slight slope forms 
in the middle of his back, small patches of hair removed and 
callouses forming wear a saddle would be worn. Vericose veins 
rise from his lean and muscular form throughout his body, though 
mainly upon his haunches and down his legs. Long and wrinkly, 
the stallions neck seems a bit longer than average, lending 
itself to a slightly arched appearance as it ascends into a black 
muzzle with a white snip upon his nose. Dark brown eyes look 
alertly from beneath two high-perched ears, the right of which 
has a V shaped sliced from it.

A young, strong destrier with a snow white coat stands here.~
   Its coat is white with a few grey specks on its hind quarters. 
Its long mane and tail are also of white hair. Thick cords of 
muscle ripple under its hide as it moves on long, strong legs. 
Standing much taller than the average horse this massive warhorse 
casts its intense eyes about almost constantly, its ears flicking 
at any sound.

Selwyn Rowlie balding overweight Garrison_Cook byPhear~
a balding, overweight man with blue eyes~
A balding, overweight man with blue eyes keeps busy here.~
   The most noticeable feature of this man is his girth. Severely 
overweight, he looks like a man who knows his food well. His cheeks and 
nose are rosy and his countenance is jovial. His hair is brown, what 
little of it is left, and his eyes are vivid gems of blue in the 
crinkles and creases of his face. His eyebrows are wild and bushy and 
expressive; his lips so thin as to be nearly nonexistent. His hands are 
worn, large and strong.

a massive destrier~
A massive destrier stands here flicking its tail.~
   Almost half again the size of a normal riding horse, this 
monstrous warhorse casts its intelligent and intense eyes about 
almost constantly, pawing a massive hoof at the ground and snorting 
irritably. Its coat is a light grey with a black mane, tail and 
feathers. Thick cords of muscle ripple under its hide.

an immense, pitch-black-coated charger~
An immense, pitch-black-coated charger towers here.~
   His head held with little humility, this stallion towers at 
seventeen hands height. A fibrous muscle structure and a heavy 
physique hint great speed and power. The sleek midnight coat 
stretched over his hulking frame, which shimmers with each 
movement while exposed to light. A lengthy mane sprouts from the 
back of his wide-girthed neck, which tapers neatly as it reaches 
his forehead, below which sit a pair of brown-hued eyes, the 
whites of which are constantly visible.

Micah Rylie tow-headed muscular lad POFerinur byPhear~
a tow-headed, muscular lad~
A tow-headed, muscular lad stands here~
   This boy is come early to his growth, though his oversized 
hands and feet hint at more to come.  Shoulders already heavy 
with muscle support a broad neck and a head topped with neatly 
cut blond hair.  Serious blue eyes, aged beyond their years, 
look from a broad, square-jawed face sporting a generous 
smattering of freckles.  His movements seem awkward at times.  
His hands are calloused in that particular way that any 
swordsman will recognize as coming from long hours of practice
with blade and shield, though he bears no visible scars.

A variable battalion soldier - private - stands here.~
   Rugged and scarred, this armsman's rough skin displays the 
tale of many past battles and survived hardships. His 
experienced gaze keeps a firm watch on his surroundings as he 
goes about his daily duties. The heavy mail that adorns his 
frame is worn like a familiar second skin, only slightly 
hindering this experienced warrior.

a tall skeleton with eyes glowing a soft blue~
An imposing figure of what was once a man with a soft blue glowing from it's eyes sockets stands here proudly.~
   This being is nothing but the skeleton of a man who once lived long ago. Strips of cartiledge and decomposing flesh riddle only some parts of its skeletal form, showing the age of which the creature has. Its eyes stand out above all else, staring out in a soft blueish glow. Its stature is unmoving and its form broad and tall, despite only bones being left. A tatterd cloak of white wool hangs from shoulders loosely beaing aged and worn armor. A polished shield adorns the left arm and a longsword is held in his right hand.

Strips of cartiledge and decomposing flesh riddle only some parts of its skeletal form, showing the age of which the creature has. Its stature is unmoving and its form tall but thin, despite only bones being left. A tatterd cloak of grey wool is wrapped about it, a rip visible in it over the figues chest. Clutched in its hands is an iron-bound tome of brittle ash-grey leather.

a chubby older woman~
A chubby, older woman stands here with hands on her hips.~
   This older woman has obviously seen a great deal of life and seems to approve of what she has seen. Wrinkles line her face, creasing the areas around her twinkling grey eyes, lips and even her cheeks from decades of smiling and laughing. Her lips more often than not curve upwards. Her eyebrows are thin, tapered, and as white as her hair. A matronly figure, her body is quite plump as it settles with time and gravity. Her frame and chubby little hands, while small, maintain a sense of efficiency and confidence about them. Her soft white hair seems to always be neatly combed, plaited and wrapped into a wreath over the crown of her head.

A tall, broad-shouldered, dark man is standing here.~
   A thick, ridged brow sits over a pair of dark, beady eyes, 
giving this half-troll a brutish appearance. Dark, greyish black 
skin is laced with scars in a wide assortment of shapes and 
severity, the largest of which runs directly up his back to 
dissappear as it reaches his bald skull. A set of small, dirty 
tusks jut from his broad, lower lip, the left snapped off halfway 
toward its apex, while the right seems to have been sharpened. 
Nearly as wide as he is tall, generous muscles coat his frame, 
padded with a healthy layer of fat, and his movements are slow 
and ponderous.

a tall, obsidian black destrier~
A tall, obsidian black destrier with intelligent eyes stands here.~
   This horse has a striking appearance with its shiny, black 
coat the hue of obsidian, its tall well-proportioned frame 
generously corded with well developed muscles, and its long wavy 
black mane and tail. Upon its thick and muscular neck, its well 
proportioned head has fine features and its large eyes bear a 
keen intelligence within them. The horse moves with trained 
grace and dignity, but with such energy that it can spring into 
action at a moment's call. Its long wavy tail occasionally 
flicks aside to ward off flies.

Sage wight sickly half decayed figure byHalfjack~
a withered, sickly and half decayed figure~
A withered, sickly and half decayed figure is here.~
   Standing tall, despite a rather large slouch, this 
half-decayed figure glares outwards with milky white eyes. Flesh 
hangs slack from the creature's bones, sometimes missing 
completely. Patchy black hair hangs down to its shoulders, with 
the hairless portions of its head revealing yellow bone. The 
right side of its chest is completely devoid of flesh, revealing 
the bone underneath, and the lack of organs, which allows for an 
almost undisturbed view right through the figure. Its fingertips 
are sharpened into claws, and its palms are torn up, showing 
bloodstained bones.

A dust-covered, mummified wight is here~
   The wight's flesh, incredibly well-preserved and dried, is 
drawn taught over the creature's bones. Thick layers of dust 
have settled over his form, covering up or heavily muting the 
colors of his body, except for his bright milky white eyes. His 
hair is a dull black, covered and inundated with dark grey dust. 
His fingertips have been sharpened into claws, each extending 
from the already bone thin fingers into needle-sharp points.

A small striped kitten, with large blue eyes is here~
   Over-sized blue eyes, with curiously enlarged pupils gaze out 
from the otherwise miniscule form of this kitten. Black lines 
form a faint 'M' across his forehead, followed up promptly by 
black and orange stripes across a brown canvas of fur. Aroun his 
mouth, the fur is bright white, creating a small beard which 
contrasts strongly with his otherwise fairly dark coloring. His 
whiskers are long and curved forwards slightly, adding to the 
image of facial hair. His front paws are similarly white, though 
his rear follow the striped pattern that covers the rest of his 
body.

A wizened, warty old goblin stands hunched here.~
   This goblin, a male, is very old. He has long, spindly limbs 
with a greyish-green complexion and he is covered from head to 
toe in warts of various sizes. His head is bulbous with stringy 
grey hair and he has large, frog-like eyes, a thin nose and a 
wide mouth. His ears are large and pointed and tend to flap 
about when he moves.

a steel-grey-eyed man with long black hair~
A man with steel-grey-eyes and long black hair stands quietly here.~
   Looming imperiously over most lesser men, this man bears the 
clear marks of his Dunedain heritage. Stern steel-grey eyes peer 
out from his chiseled features, with a wisdom and age betraying 
his middle-aged appearance. He is quite stout, hardened sinew 
composing his large frame. Straight jet-black hair cascades over 
his shoulders and back, a sheen of light catching in the strands. 
His hands are broad and calloused and his composure grim.

an agile, steel grey coated stallion~
An agile, steel-grey stallion gazes out with bright, alert eyes.~
   Long-limbed and sleekly muscled with a compact torso, this 
horse is a fine specimen of its breed. Its head has a curiously 
dished profile, giving prominence to a pair of fiercely alert 
eyes. Sharp ears point out from a silky black mane, swiveling 
this way and that as the horse takes in its surroundings at every 
moment. Its coat is a lustrous steel grey, growing darker where 
it covers the flanks and slender legs.

a thickset, amber-eyed man~
A thickset, amber-eyed man is here.~
   This man's barrel-chested torso stands upon a pair of squat, 
muscular legs, giving him an overall stocky appearance. His fair 
skin has been sun-bronzed and weathered by the elements, a 
tribute to a life of outdoor toil. His charcoal black hair is 
kept short and cropped in a military fashion upon his head, and 
hard amber eyes look out from a somewhat rounded face centered by 
a large bulbous nose.

An elite uruk shock trooper variable stands here.~
   So far as Uruk-Hai are concerned, this one bears itself with 
an arrogance seen as haughty even by most of its kind, its 
bestial eyes gazing dismissively over all that is surveys. Head 
held high and shoulders set back, this uruk stands nearly 
man-high. Jagged, yellow teeth bare behind savagely peeled-back, 
black lips and many scars riddle this uruk's body. Under these 
peppered scars and gashes, so calloused and tough in places that 
it is comparable to leather, a dusky black skin stretches taut 
over muscle and bone.

   Looming well over the height of most smaller buildings, this 
fearfully massive troll towers over its surroundings. Its thick 
hide is a meshwork of scars, and its beady eyes survey the area 
with a cold glint. Long, jagged, yellowed teeth protrude from 
its maw, glistening with a foul patina of putrid saliva, and long 
ropes of thick, corded muscle cover its entire body.

a delicate-featured, sable-crowned woman~
A woman with delicate features, soft grey eyes and a crown of sable colored hair ~
   This woman's heart-shaped face bears a delicacy that is 
accented by her coloring. Her skin is as pale and elegant as 
porcelain, framed by a mane of sable hair; more often than not 
sleekly coiffed. Eyes the soft shade of a grey dove's wing gaze 
out with clarity from under a brow that can only be described as 
noble. A mouth, mobile and quick to demonstrate moods through 
minuscule motions, is formed with a narrow upper lip and plumper 
rose-tinted lower tier that hide pearl-like teeth from view. Her 
willowy figure is tall, but not devoid of curves. Youthful, but 
well past her teenage years, she carries herself with the 
confidence of experience; dark head held high.

descended from the breed. It's short haired coat is roan in 
color and well brushed. This horse appears to be built for 
speed, looking lighter than a standard warhorse. This specimen 
is still built heavier than standard riding horses and looks as 
though it can hold it's own in combat.

   A rough and dirty individual, this person looks to have very 
little concern for anyone but themselves. Muscular yet, trim 
this individual looks quite capable to survive the wilds. Hair 
grows unchecked and uncared for, as well as pretty much 
everything else.

Ellmeera byConscript Kramatian graceful sorrel mare~
a graceful sorrel mare~
A graceful sorrel mare whickers softly here.~
   With the sleek copper hairs of a true sorrel, this mare is 
long-limbed and slender with a compact torso. The head of this 
steed has a curiously dished profile, giving prominence to a pair 
of alert brown eyes. Sharp copper-red ears perk out from a silky 
golden mane, swiveling at the slightest noise. Her tail is a 
similar golden confection to the mane, a glimmering light 
contrast to the bright copper of her hide. Never still, from her 
pointed ears to her swishing tail, the graceful horse is a fine 
example of a delicate Kramatian bred for riding.

a tall man with midnight-black hair and shadowy grey eyes~
A tall man stands here, with midnight-black hair and shadowy grey eyes.~
   With a regal bearing, this slightly weathered man, his face 
bearing some wrinkles around his eyes and lips, stands tall and 
proud. His hair, meticulously groomed to a fine silky black 
sheen drifts down past his shoulders, pushed back to reveal his 
large forehead. Fairly bushy black eyebrows seem ever creased at 
severe angles, providing a stark contrast to his shadowy grey 
eyes. His nose is perfectly straight, and flares out at the end 
to two wide nostrils. His cheeks are even and flat, their shape 
tarnished only by faint laugh lines, until they get to his 
pronounced jaw, with his rounded chin. Broadness takes command 
as his shoulders and chest are concerned, narrowing evenly until 
his legs are reached, which, though still slender, bear a refined 
musculature. His skin is an even pale, almost sickly in its 
extremity, and seeming almost fragile.

a short, stern-faced man~
A short, stern-faced man is here, directing workers.~
   Slightly balding, what is left of this man's hair is grey. 
Despite his age, his dark brown eyes appear quite alert. He is 
short of stature, partly due to his age though it is doubtful he 
was ever a tall man. His movements, slowed with age, are 
nevertheless deliberate.

A monstrous, black, long fanged wolf with glowing red eyes prowls here.~
   Fur as dark as a moonless night completely coats this hulking 
wolf from head to toe. Piercing, glowing, red eyes stand out 
starkly against the black background that is this wolf's body, 
lying slanted within its feral-looking, canine face. A gaping 
maw splits open to reveal a set of frighteningly sharp teeth, the 
foremost of these being a pair of extrememly long fangs. Tough 
sinew ropes its way about this wolf's body, from its muscular 
neck and shoulders, down to its lithe hindquarters, rippling 
beneath the skin with every movement. Each of its four paws are 
the size of a large, full-grown human's hands, ending in black 
claws that dig into the earth as it moves.

absolutely monstrous proportions for such a creature, its long, 
bulky legs covered in knife-length barbs that glisten black. Its 
heavy, bloated midsection is covered in a shiny black carapace, 
overlaid with a short, spiky layer of what appears to be a 
bristly kind of fur. Eight dull red eyes flick about at the top 
of the spiders head, set above a massive collection of fangs.

and graceful nonetheless.

wren bird pudgy mottled brown xSONG_OF_SHADOW_PLOTx xNauriel~
a pudgy, mottled-brown wren~
A pudgy, mottled-brown wren is perched on a branch overhead.~
   The body of this small, plump bird forms a near half-circle, 
its back flat and its lightly-coloured lower body rounded until 
its thin legs are hardly visible beneath. Its head almost 
appears to be a part of its torso, and is set with a pair of 
glistening black, beady eyes and a short, thin beak. Its tail 
stands straight up behind it, and when it is still its short 
wings blend with the mottled, dusky feathers upon its back.

a small, grey-furred shrew~
A small, grey-furred shrew rustles through the underbrush.~
   This small creature closely resembles a cross between a mouse 
and a mole in appearance. Its body is somewhat elongated and its 
crooked snout comes to a downward point. A long, rat-like tail 
extends from its furry grey body, and is face is marked with a 
pair of beady black eyes and small, sharp teeth.

Herbert mottled grey frog xpofMarv xNauriel~
a mottled-grey frog~
A mottled-grey frog hops about here.~
   This small creature is one of many of its species that call 
the marsh home. It is on a constant quest, searching out tasty 
small insects to slap out of the air with a long tongue. Loud 
and obnoxious, the constant croaks and other sounds leaving this 
amphibian make it a sore sight as well as a burden on the ears.
