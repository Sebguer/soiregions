An Upward Sloping Mountain Trail~
   This rocky trail winds upward along the western face of the 
mountain, weaving north and south to lower the vertical pitch. 
The trail itself is well formed, only a few loose rocks and 
pebbles presenting a danger to travelers. Light vegetation grows 
alongside the road, though the slope is barren of anything larger 
than a small bush.

The End Of The Mountain Trail At A Cave Entrance~
   The mountain trail peaks here, turning southward into the 
large opening of a dark cave. The view eastwards is amazing, the 
once royal city of Osgiliath below, the mighty Anduin splitting 
it into two. Beyond the city lie the forests of the Ithilien, 
bordered by the Ephel Duath, looming with a menacing visage 
in the distance.

A Large Cavern~
   Carved from the mountainside, this cavern is quite enormous. 
Mostly circular in shape, there is room enough to fit a moderate 
sized home. The ceiling is suspended by ornate columns, 
weathered by time, yet still intricate in design. Carvings can 
still be made out upon them, images of short bearded men laboring 
with hammers and picks. A large set of dented and hacked iron 
doors are set into the western wall of the cave.

Within a Large, Masterfully-Carved Hall~
   This hall verges on the lines between large and monstrously 
sized, but it is the scrollwork, detail, and quality of the 
carved stone that sets it apart from nigh almost any other 
structure. The stone of this room, despite the heavy layer of 
dust that has settled unmarred on many of the surfaces, has been 
carved directly out of the mountain and is pristinely smooth to 
the touch, alluding to the prodigious skill of whatever long-dead 
craftsmen made this area. In spite of the glorious carvings that 
have been worked into the functionality of this large, Hall-esque 
room, it all seems to have been for naught as the disuse of the 
room is obvious: the wood of tables is mostly rotten away, smooth 
dust covers most of the floor and other surfaces, and the rooms 
harsh, echoing silence fills all.

Within an Ornately-Carved Hallway~
   This hallway seems to have been carved smoothly from the stone 
of the mountain, running a rigidly straight path. Any with even 
a glimmering of stonemason knowledge would recognize the 
significance of a smooth, straight hallway, the floor beneath the 
feet of any traveler without scuffs or mars, or even seams. 
Carved at perhaps abdomen-level on the walls of this hallway, a 
pattern of geometric shapes have been etched into the dark stone, 
attractive in their prim functionality and cohesive design.

A Functional Hallway~
   The scrollwork and other prettifications of the stone of the 
earlier rooms is gone here in this one, it being a simple, 
straightforwards hallway. While the aesthetic value is gone, 
there are is still the practical value of a perfectly straight, 
utterly smooth hallway that has been carved from the hard stone 
of the mountain. Strangely, there are no wall brackets or 
similar items to hold light sources of any kind.

A Circular Room With Downwards Spiraling Stairs~
   The smooth, pure functionality of the previous decour sets the 
tone for this room, no signs of decoration or other things of 
similar, frivolous nature present. In the center of the room, 
however, the stone has been cut away and the tunnel continues 
leading downwards, a masterfully-cut spiral staircase descends 
downward and into darkness. A thick layer of dust has settled 
over the area and staircase.

Smoothly-Carved Intersection at the Base of a Staircase~
   Aside from a staircase leading upwards, this area serves as an 
intersection for north, south, and western passages, all smoothly 
carved and unmarred by the seemingly prodigiously long passage of 
time. Upon the walls in this area here, however, some idle 
decoration has managed to scrounge its way onto the walls, 
seeming to be more idle carvings and artistic musings rather than 
any great masterwork.

Within a Scree-Strewn Tunnel~
   The majority of this short tunnel is roughly hewn, the ground 
and walls uneven and even jagged in some places, a far cry from 
the civilized and almost decorous manner of the southern area. 
Scree and other loose rocks is still pooled here on the floor, 
though a layer of dust sits atop it, stating the passage of time 
since its conception. The northern section of stone is almost 
porous with a large number of slight indentions into it, before 
these abruptly halt.

   For perhaps the first half of this area, the stone is smoothly 
carved and displays an almost tedious level of care before, quite 
abruptly, this level of sophistication drops off. The western 
wall of this area is pock-marked and heavily hewn from mining 
picks, an indention in the middle of the wall present, as if 
someone or something had dug as deeply as desired and then simply 
stopped. The scored face of the western wall is only some 
fifteen or twenty feet from the eastern intersection.

heap of dirt and broken stone sit at the base of the tunnel's 
end, along with abandoned picks and hammers, the layer of dust 
that covers them putting the lie to any suspicions of recent 
usage. A stack of broad lumber sits against the wall, as some of 
the support beams have already been put into place. The shabbily 
hewn wall along the southern way is only some ten feet from the 
northern area.

The Base of the Mountain~
   The fertile lands of Anorien change slightly here, the 
countryside a little less green, the ground beginning to slope 
upwards. Mount Mindolluin looms to the south and to the west as 
the White Mountains stand in the distance. Not many people are 
seen here, though the random hunter can be seen, tracking an 
animal. A small, dirt trodden trail is visible to the west, 
snaking its way up the mountainside past a newly-constructed high 
gate of heavily-strapped oak logs. There is a small, old wooden 
cabin at the base of the trail. 
   A small hut with a sloped roof offers some solace to the 
Wardens who guard the gate and some stables sit nearby.

A Trail at the Base of the Mountain~
   The mountain trail slopes sharply upwards, winding its way up 
the mountainside. While steep, the path is in a mostly good 
condition the dirt packed hard, loose stones few. However, a 
large section of the path has fallen away with the tracks from a 
cart clearly showing a narrow escape. In that part it is only a 
few feet across. 
   Several large boulders lay off to the distance, the ground 
slowly reclaiming them as grass grows at their base. The trail 
continues on southwards, as it turns to continue its ascent. The 
fields of Anorien lay to the east, and beyond them, the river 
Anduin.

A Turn in the Trail Around a Rock Outcropping~
   The mountain trail continues its steep ascent up the 
mountainside here, turning sharply around an enormous outcropping 
of rock, jutting forth from the earth. The stone towers far 
above, taller than a two story building, a sheer rock face 
greeting travelers. The trail pushes eastward, starting to 
ascend above Anorien.

treacherous. To the north the mountainside slopes downward at a 
steep pitch, little stopping someone from tumbling downward to 
their doom. Miles of Anorien can now be seen to the north and 
east, a wooded forest visible further. The trail turns again 
here, its steep slope heading south and further up the mountain.

A Wooden Bridge Across a Brook~
   The trail here is cut in two by an ice-cold brook that flows 
down the mountain. Less wide than a man is tall, the brook 
nevertheless runs swiftly downstream. A wooden bridge provides 
travel over the brook. Its wood is obviously old, weathered by 
time and elements, yet its construction seems sturdy - a 
testament to the original builders. Upon one of the support 
beams of the bridge strange sigils are made out, barely visible. 
A waterfall seems to be present west, as is evident by the dull 
roar of water coming from that direction.

A Trail Up The Mountain~
   At this height much of Anorien can be seen, along with the 
city of Osgiliath, far in the distance, cut in two by the river 
Anduin. The trail used to split here, one route travelling up a 
very steep and treacherous-looking path, the other more travelled 
path continuing in its north and south directions, though 
leveling off quite a bit. The path widens as it travels to the 
south and trees can be seen farther off. The sound of a brook 
filters in from the north. 
   The old path leading upwards has been completely sheared from 
the rockface by recent rockfalls.

A Small Box Canyon in the Mountainside~
   Once again the trail turns sharply, this time forced upwards 
by a gaping canyon slicing through the mountainside. The canyon 
runs far eastwards, likely carved by a thin stream running down 
it. No discernable path descends into it, the only sign of 
travel the worn path, stretching north and twisting up the 
mountain. A large tree stands at the edge of the ravine, its 
roots partially exposed by the downward slope.

debris scattered along its narrow length, with larger boulders 
almost blocking a small cave opening set into one of the eastern 
shoulders of the mountainside. The entire path has been lowered 
by the recent rockfalls, with the way northwards a scramble 
around wrecked boulders towards a natural stone archway.

in the distance upon the snow-capped peaks. A small forest glen 
dwells southwards, mighty trees towering above a small camp. The 
trail continues upward, winding back and forth as it climbs.

A Stand of Trees on the Side of the Mountain~
   The area widens enough for a growth of trees here, their 
stature tall and mighty. They cast a large amount of shade upon 
the area, shadowed further to the south by the sloping mountain 
walls. Pine needles and cones dot the ground here, formed of 
mostly dirt with an occasional large rock poking through. A 
ravine to the south and west separates the area from the 
mountain, while a steep slope to the east blocks movement in that 
direction. 
   A small trail winds to the south out of sight into an outcrop 
of rocks. From the scrubbed rock and cleared bracken it seems 
this has been recently exposed.

   Rather small in size, this cave isn't much larger than a 
single room home. The walls are rough stone and damp to the 
touch as water drips down them. The ceiling is high enough for a 
man to stand without crouching, though barely. There is a potent 
musty smell, as there is recent evidence of animal activity, 
mainly in the form of dung.

   Huge walls of sheer stone rise above on both sides. Boulders

some stones in the mountain are fairly loose, providing no sturdy

flinging dust and sharp gravel as it gusts around the side of the 
mountain and partially obscured, some secure footholdings provide 
passage for the continuing climb southwards along the

   Here the mountain becomes nearly vertical, ascending steeply. 
The rocks are jagged and bare, and a few holes spaced in between

while the trail descends into a narrow path of stone footholds to

   Steep and somewhat wide, the trail climbs up the face of the 
mountain, an ever cold chill hanging in the air. A few pine 
needles litter the rocky path though otherwise it is bare and 
bleak, the stony crags jutting out of the side of the mountain 
providing for a nearly-blinding field of white. Over the edge of 
the road remains only a sharp-faced cliff, a perilous journey for 
any that attempt to to descend it while continuing up the 
mountain side, the trail continues. A large hole in the rocks to 
the east grants a view of what appears to be a secluded canyon 
beyond with a stream running into it.

   The trail wends its way up the side of the mountain, craggy 
white rocks protruding and often obscuring the rocky path ahead. 
Very little vegetation grows here, a handful of weeds sprouting 
out of the cracks between the boulders and occasional pebbles dot 
the road though well-formed it continues to be. Far up above, 
the snow-capped peaks of the mountain can be seen and the air 
carries a cold chill upon its breeze. To the south, a crevice in 
the side of the mountain breaks the rocky path and provides a 
rather large gap between this side of the landing and the flat, 
narrow ledge upon the other side. 
   At the top of a plateau across the valley, a small village can

steep angle. What is left of the trail here is heavily covered 
in rocks and other debris and heavier vegetation grows here than 
previously upon the trail. Moss creeps along the ground and to 
one side of the sheer face of the mountain, the protruding rocks 
provide a steep climb down the edge, partially covered in vines.

On a Narrow Ledge~
   Here, the trail narrows and becomes more obscure, more dirt 
covering the path as it continues onto a tiny ledge barely wide 
enough for one person alone to stand. The way across is made 
even more perilous by the jagged rocks that jut out of the side 
of the mountain, often well into the way of the path itself, 
nearly blocking one's access to pass however near the western end 
of the ledge, the trail can be faintly seen heading further in 
that direction and a few stones allow for a climb down below. 
   At the top of a plateau across the valley, a small village can 
be seen.

A Scenic Waterfall Leading to a Series of Pools~
   A sheer cliff of several hundred feet is set into the 
mountainside here, creating a spectacular site as the water from 
a fast flowing steam tumbles down to its base. The land here is 
tiered, creating a series of pools as the water fills one and 
flows onward to the next. The pool at the base of the waterfall 
is the largest of these pools, its water white as it falls from 
its great height. The other pools are quiet, however, as the 
water flows forth. Some are quite placid, though their waters 
are ice cold. The last pool dumps out into a small brook, its 
waters flowing swiftly as it is forced to a narrow passage 
eastward. A thick, perpetual mist floats, suspended in the air, 
kicked up from the falling water. 
   An abandoned wide hole is half dug here, scratched out of the 
rocks themselves.

Where the Shoreline of the River Anduin Meets the Walls of Osgiliath ~
   Here the countryside of Anorien reaches the western bank of 
the great River Anduin. Composed mainly of sand and dirt mixed 
with the occasional scattering of stone and rock, it slopes 
easily into the swiftly flowing river to the east. Tall grass 
begins just before the shore to the west before spreading out 
into the farmland and roads of the landscape of Northern Gondor. 
   Northwards the high southern walls of Osgiliath rises up, 
stretching out to the east over the broad River Anduin. The sand 
gathers at the base of the wall and the western path to the road 
is marked by a slight uphill climb.

Western Shore of the River Anduin~
   Curving gently from the south to the north, the River Anduin's 
sand and dirt bank widens a bit, forcing back the encroaching 
grassland. Far across the river's waters, the eastern bank can 
be spotted, almost out of sight in bad weather. A few birds fly 
quickly overhead, fast enough to avoid any predators in the sky, 
and high enough as not to be snagged by a hidden danger in the 
grass. 
   The shoreline continues naturally to the south, while 
northwards it meets with the walls of the city of Osgiliath. 
Uphill to the west lies the Lond Caras-Mir.

East of the Road on the Shore of the River Anduin~
   With a slight inward curve, the River Anduin keeps to the 
western bank, flowing alongside in an easy, fluid manner. Easily 
sloping underwater, the dirt mixed sand is lapped by the swiftly 
moving river. The bank extends the width of twenty feet or so, 
breaking suddenly into thin, knee-high grass which waves with the 
movement of the air about it. Small animals dart in and out of 
the grass, leave tracks in the mud and then disappear as quickly 
as they appeared. 
   To the west the sandy shore is stabilised by the road of Lond 
Caras-Mir as it runs from Osgiliath to the walls of the Pelennor 
Fields.

the towering peak of Mount Mindolluin and the White Mountains 
that stretch out beyond it is always visible, capped with snow 
and often cloaked in mist. Through this area grassy fallow 
fields and small hillocks vie for space between rows of planted 
crops and grazing livestock, the situation repeated throughout 
the lands of Anorien in Northern Gondor. A light copse of 
woodland can be seen to north, the broad River Anduin flowing out 
from behind it. 
   The sandy shore of the River Anduin can be seen to the south

South of a Road at the Base of the Rammas Echor~
   The normal grass and farmland of the lands of Anorien come to 
a halt as they reach the base of the Rammas Echor, the mighty 
stone wall that acts as the first layer of defence to the city of 
Minas Tirith that lies within. There are few holdings in front 
of the walls, the land periodically cleared by soldiers of the 
city to ensure any enemy attacking is deprived of cover of any 
sort. The tended land of Anorien lies to the north. 
   To the north a gate lies in the white stone wall, a road 
leading out east from it.

Nearing the River Anduin to the South by the Rammas Echor~
   Stretching many miles from east to west, the Rammas Echor 
signals the end of the Gondorian fiefdom of Anorien here. Built 
from large blocks of white stone, the crenulated battlements are 
constantly patrolled by heavily armed soldiers ensuring the 
safety of the lands inside the walls to the south. The 
vegetation here consists mainly of dirt and patches of grass, but 
in the distance to the north farmlands can be seen. 
   As the dirt before the wall continues to the south, the waters 
of the River Anduin can be seen as the Rammas Echor is built 
directly above its cool grasp.

The Rammas Echor at the River Anduin~
   Here the Rammas Echor meets perfectly flush with the glassy 
waters of the River Anduin. Knee-high grasslands sprawl out to 
the northeast, following the gently curving river bank. The 
grass moves with any wind, brushing past in a wave. Small 
animals dart in and out of the grasses to the river, pausing if 
only for a moment to clean their bodies in the waters, then 
disapearing quickly, back into the long grass. Sand and dirt mix 
together to form the riverbank, running under the current in an 
easy slope. 
   To the west, the great white wall of the Rammas Echor prevents 
any travel. North, the riverbank opens further into the grassy 
interior of the landscape of Anorien.

Anorien Countryside Off a Turn in the Highway~
   While not overly so, the lands of Anorien are fertile enough 
to provide a decent livelihood to the farmers that tend to the 
land and their livestock upon it. Bordered to the north and east 
by the wide River Anduin, the countryside of Northern Gondor is 
peaceful at most times as its inhabitants go about their daily 
business. The colossal shape of Mount Mindolluin is always 
present to the west, as are the White Mountains that stretch out 
further beyond it. 
   To the south as well as to the east the highway Lond Caras-Mir

Green Fields Near Lond Caras-Mir~
   In the fiefdom of Anorien, a complacent peace and calm hold 
over the many small towns and isolated farms that dot the 
landscape of fields and gentle green hills. The regular patrol 
of soldiers belonging to the local lords of the land upon the 
roads and highways that cut through Northern Gondor ensures that 
no harm can come to the valuable agricultural land of the mighty 
country. To the west, the countryside expands onwards for 
hundreds of miles, unhindered by anything, while the River Anduin 
acts as the northern and eastern border of Anorien. 
   A paved road bearing a light stream of traffic lies to the 
east.

for the eye to see, farmers caring for to their crops and 
shepherds managing their herds during the day and at night the 
villages and farmsteads that dot the land casting out points of 
light in the distance. A few travellers can be seen moving 
through the tended lands rather then walk upon the more crowded 
highways that cut through Anorien.

Easily sloping underwater, the dirt mixed sand is lapped by the 
swiftly moving river. The bank extends the width of twenty feet 
or so, breaking suddenly into thin, knee-high grass which waves 
with the movement of the air about it. Small animals dart in and 
out of the grass, leave tracks in the mud and then disappear as 
quickly as they appeared. 
   To the north and east the shoreline quickly disappears under 
the fast flowing waters of the River Anduin.

Deep Pine Cabin~
   A tended lawn stretches out here, surrounded by a picket fence 
of deep brown wood. A snaking path of white stones set into the 
earth winds toward the door of a small, rectangular cabin to the 
west. To the east the lawn spills out into the Anorien, joining 
with the fields north of the Rammas Echor.

The Interior of a Log Cabin~
   This simple, rectangular cabin is fashioned of large, pinewood 
logs, stacked one atop another and intersecting at the corners. 
The floor is made of panelled wood, lightly stained and 
well-swept. Two windows are set into the cabin walls, rimmed in 
bronze. The cabin is cluttered with furniture and various other 
effects, but its small size grants it a cosy feeling. A large 
stone fireplace is set into the western wall. Through the 
southern window the edge of the Rammas Echor can be spied, 
winding off into the distance.

A Rock-Strewn Grass Meadow~
   Jutting from the ground here and there, weathered grey stones 
form long clusters amidst the grass. The ground in this area, 
sloping gently downward toward the river to the east, has been 
cleared of brush and trees to leave a meadowy lawn. A low stone 
wall runs along the borders of the land, pausing briefly at a 
broken wooden gate through which meanders a dirt path, its faded 
wagon ruts slowly being retaken by the grass. Slightly downhill 
to the east, the path leads to an old windmill, obviously no 
longer in service for its original purpose but reclaimed as a 
dwelling of sorts. To the north, crouched where trees begin 
rising from the grass, is a small storage shed, the faintest of 
footpaths parting the way to its weathered door.

A Small Stone-Walled Room~
   Obviously refurbished, this room was once apparently used for 
milling grain. Now, however, it has been converted to a small 
sitting room, the stone walls patched here and there. The floor 
is wood, worn but sturdy, and large beams stretch overhead to 
hold the upper level. In the center of the room, held in place 
by means of a thick wooden pole, a battered old millstone has 
been converted into a table, raised off the ground and held by 
chunks of stone. Behind it, on the southern wall, a fireplace 
lends heat to the room. A creaky wooden staircase on the 
northern wall leads up to the second floor, and a door leads 
west, out to the yard. A broad archway opens up to the east, 
leading into a kitchen.

A Tall, Drafty Room~
   What once was the upper floor of the windmill is now a 
bedroom, a rough and slanted ceiling of wood added high above to 
keep the elements out. The wooden walls fail to do this 
completely, however, letting drafts in to search about randomly. 
A tiny window of thick, wavy glass has been added on the western 
wall to let light in during the day. In the center of the room, 
a broad wooden pole stretches from ceiling to floor. A creaky 
wooden staircase leads down from the northeastern corner of the 
room.

A Small Kitchen~
   A more recent addition, the stone walls of this kitchen are a 
slightly different color than those of the rest of the building. 
The floor here is packed dirt, so hard as to be almost glossy. A 
thatched roof above slants down away from the rest of the 
dwelling, giving the room a skewed appearance. Furnished 
sparsely, there is still little room to spare here. Two windows 
flank either side of a wide door on the eastern wall, looking out 
over the river. To the west, a broad archway has been opened in 
the wall to allow access to another room.

A Gently Sloping Field~
Ever so gently sloping down to the east, toward the river, 
this field is fenced in by a low stone wall running along the 
edges of the property. Rich soil, plowed evenly in long furrows, 
gives way at the northernmost edges of the area to a lightly 
wooded copse, amidst which stoops a storage shed. To the west 
stands an old windmill, the broken and bare blades no longer 
turning, even in the strongest of winds. A few small paths
lead the way through the fields, allowing access to the crops
In the distance, a modest little cottage with arched windows
and drawn-back curtains emerges before the southern wall,
shrouded in ivy vines and surrounded with wildflowers.

A Dim, Musty Storage Shed~
   Little more than a wooden box, the inside of this shed is dim 
and musty. The planks that make up the walls are warped and 
weathered with age, knotholes and cracks allowing any light 
outside to seep in. The air is heavy, scents of oiled metal, 
mildew, old leather, and more mingling together along with dust 
that floats lazily about when anything is disturbed. Hooks and 
shelves give extra storage space for tools and goods. The roof 
is slanted away from a double-door that opens to the south.

A Cleared Yard Amidst the Birch Wood~
   The birch forest comes to a sudden end as it reaches this 
small yard. The trees and underbrush have been cleared away, 
leaving a field of assorted weeds and wildflowers. On the 
northern end of the yard the remains of a cabin stands, the front 
porch left as the remains of blackened timbers. Long pine logs 
that formed the walls and roof have rolled away, flame-licked and 
shattered. The shingles and a few timbers that formed the roof 
have fallen in, and the stone chimney that once stood upon the 
eastern side has fallen off into the clearing. The corner of the 
cabin closest to the door stands partially still, but the rest 
have burnt or rolled away.

   The birch forest comes to a sudden end as it reaches this

a blanket of snow covers cleared ground. To the north, a log

Inside The Remains of a Burnt-Down Cabin~
   The interior of this log cabin remains in tatters. The logs
that once formed the walls have turned to ash or rolled away
from the marred building. The ceiling and floor have burned
away, the floor of what appears to be a loft have fallen in
along with the roof of the cabin. Various holes have burnt
their way through the floor, sending sections to collapse
and bend to form the unstable ground.

Birch Place~
   A cleared trail leads up to a small log cabin just north of
here, in the thick of the birch woods. All around, slender birch
trees grow, many of them saplings, providing lush shade and dappling
all year round. From outside the clearing, the cabin and its surrounding
land are nearly invisible, but from here, the trail leading up to it
can be seen easily.

Inside the Log Cabin~
   This secure, snug log cabin is made with just a couple of rooms,
though they are large ones. A hearth and fireplace stands near a
wood-burning cookstove and kitchen area, while the open floorplan
opens to a living area here. A wall divides the cabin in half down
the middle. Windows are set to the north and south, each made with
wooden shutters. The floor is made of split logs that are sanded
utterly silken-smooth and planed flat. They fit together, like the
chinked walls, like jigsaw-puzzle pieces. Doors lead north, to a
small yard, and south, to the clearing and birch forest outside.

A Stone-Lined Path~
   This path of hard-packed earth is lined on either side by 
small stones of varying shades of grey. While to the north the 
path leads into Anorien, the path splits to the south, leading 
southward to a one-story house and west to a well-maintained 
vineyard surrounded by a picket fence which looks to have been 
repaired in numerous places with other pieces of wood. On the 
front of the house is a small wooden porch with a bench, and two 
four-paned windows frame the sturdy, iron-knobbed, pinewood door. 
The grounds along the pathway are beautifully landscaped with 
ornamental flowers planted in raised flowerbeds edged in stacked 
stone. A small seating area is to the east of the path, where 
the gardens tastefully highlight a granite bench.

A Lush Vineyard Surrounded by a Picket Fence~
   A wide, green field grows here, the grass lush between the 
rows of tilled earth. In each row plowed is built a low trellis 
that looks a bit like a picket fence that runs the length of the 
field; there are several of them. Growing up from the ground at 
intervals of a few feet, along each vertical pole of each length 
of trellis, is a thin vine that twines around and around the 
trellis. It expands, in its growing season, to a bush suspended 
off the ground, the green branches twining and intertwining with 
those of its neighbors until the trellis can barely be seen. As 
summer progresses, the curly tendrils of grapes begin to grow out 
from each bush, and the further along it goes, the larger and 
darker the grapes get. The whole field has a tidy, tended 
appearance. All around it, a white picket fence keeps intruders 
out; beyond the fence can be seen more farms and fields and small 
houses.

   A wide, green field grows here, the grass lush between the 
rows of tilled earth. In each row plowed is built a low trellis 
that looks a bit like a picket fence that runs the length of the 
field; there are several of them. Growing up from the ground at 
intervals of a few feet, along each vertical pole of each length 
of trellis, is a thin vine that twines around and around the 
trellis. It expands, in its growing season, to a bush suspended 
off the ground, the green branches twining and intertwining with 
those of its neighbors until the trellis can barely be seen. Rain
falls down on the plants, spattering them with water and dripping down
from the broad green leaves. The pattering sound of water droplets
can be heard here easily, while the grey sky overhead is a marked
contrast to the green fields here and beyond the fence.
~
~
   The wintry field is large, with many trellises built across
it, though in the winter, the vines growing up on them are shriveled
and dead-looking, with no leaves. The grass underfoot is brown and
dead as well, as are the few windbreak trees planted around. The fields
all around are in the same state. The white snow falling piles up
around each trellis, making conical piles, with the tufts of yellow
grass sticking up from it here and there. More snow piles up along the
trellises, giving the scene a peaceful, bucolic air.
~
   Blinding snow in all directions obscures everything, everything
in this area. If one fumbles around enough, one might just run into
a gate to the east, but otherwise, picket fences surround the field.

A Bedroom~
   The walls of this room are composed of plaster over pinewood 
planks, all painted a soft yellow. In the eastern wall is one 
small window, covered by heavy, white woolen curtains that hang 
from a bronze rod above it. The ceiling and floor are made from 
planks of wood, to which a dark stain has been applied. Though 
still in good shape, the floor bears scratches in many places. 
The ceiling is mostly unadorned, except for a single string that 
hangs down in the southeast corner of the room. A door to the 
west opens into the living room.

A Pine-Walled Kitchen~
   The walls of this room have been painted a clean, eggshell 
white color, and make the room appear quite bright. 
Richly-stained pinewood planks have been laid diagonally through 
the rectangular room, giving the floor a tasteful elegance. 
Against the western wall is the stove, above which faint stains 
from cooking can be detected on the wall. A window in the 
northern wall is set over a copper wash basin. A door in the 
eastern wall opens into the living room, and a similar door in 
the southern wall opens into a small spare bedroom. A large 
trapdoor opens into the cellar below.

deep and spacious stone cellar. The floor and walls are 
constructed of large pieces of dark grey stone, while the ceiling

A Rough, Overgrown Field~
   This field is rocky and the ground rough, overgrown with thick 
grass and weeds, small shrubs, and trees. The vegetation 
thickens as it approaches an old stone fence to the northwest, 
becoming a full-fledged woodland beyond. A wide pathway has been 
cleared here, bordered by large stones and littered with sparse 
gravel. To the east stands a building - a bulky extension built 
off of an old, run-down windmill. To the south, the pathway 
leads to a grassy pasture beside the windmill. To the east, it 
runs up to a wooden door in the stone first floor of the 
building.

   Sturdy stone walls form this long room, which seems to be a 
more recent addition to the older building it borders to the 
south. Most of the southern wall is weathered and worn, save the 
area around where a fireplace is tucked into the far southeastern 
corner for heat. A broad hearth of stone set in the wooden floor 
before it protects from errant embers. The only windows in the 
room are tiny, looking out from beside the door to the west that 
leads out to an overgrown field. To the north, another, wider 
door is set into the wall, while a stone staircase leads upward
past the heavy wooden beams that support the ceiling.

   This hallway continues north from the narrow landing to the

with great heat and flame. The ashen walls seem to soak up any 
light that shines from the small window far to the south, causing 
odd shadows that sweep all along this area. Doors lead in three

East of a Birch Woodland~
   In the fiefdom of Anorien, a complacent peace and calm hold 
over the many small towns and isolated farms that dot the 
landscape of fields and gentle green hills. The regular patrol 
of soldiers belonging to the local lords of the land upon the 
roads and highways that cut through Northern Gondor ensures that 
no harm can come to the valuable agricultural land of the mighty 
country. To the west, the countryside expands onwards for 
hundreds of miles, unhindered by anything, while the River Anduin 
acts as the northern and eastern border of Anorien. 
   The fields and pastures continue in all directions save to the 
west where a birch woodland begins. A barn stands right to the 
south.

Fields Between the River Anduin's Shore and a Birch Woodland~
   In the distance to the south-west, no matter where one stands 
here, the towering peak of Mount Mindolluin and the White 
Mountains that stretch out beyond it is always visible, capped 
with snow and often cloaked in mist. Through this area grassy 
fallow fields and small hillocks vie for space between rows of 
planted crops and grazing livestock, the situation repeated 
throughout the lands of Anorien in Northern Gondor. A light 
copse of woodland can be seen to west, the broad River Anduin 
flowing out from behind it. 
   The shore of the River Anduin can be seen to the north, while 
a dense birch forest lies to the west.

A Dusty Bunk Room~
   Dim and dusty, the wooden walls of this room are lined with 
wooden bunks stacked two high, each of which bears a very simple 
straw mattress. There is little room to maneuver between the 
bunks, and the air is constantly laden with motes of dust and the 
smells of sweat, soil, and occasionally animals. The only exit 
is a stone staircase that leads down.

   The dirt floor of this small barn is strewn with straw and 
packed to an almost glossy hardness. A few animal stalls line 
the northern wall, supporting above them a small hay loft. 
Wooden beams studded with pegs and old nails rise up to the 
shadowy rafters above, and the occasional knothole in the walls 
lets light squeeze through during the day to illuminate specks of 
dust floating about. A wide barn door opens to a field east of 
here, and a wooden door leads through the stone lower portion of 
the southern wall.

A Cleared Field~
   Sloping slowly downward to the south, this field is completely 
cleared of errant vegetation from the woodland that lies past the 
stone fence to the north. Below the field, the land runs to the 
shore of the Anduin River, whose broad waters flow lazily by. 
Jutting from the small barn that lies to the west is a pig-pen, 
which seems to stay rather muddy in most weather. The barn leans 
against a building to its south, a bulky-looking windmill that 
has obviously been added to several times. Barring the way to 
another field south of here is a wooden fence, in which is a gate 
bearing lock and chain.

Turn in the River Anduin Shoreline~
   Curving gently from the west to the north, the River Anduin's 
sand and dirt bank widens a bit, forcing back the encroaching 
grassland. Far across the river's waters, the eastern bank can 
be spotted, almost out of sight in bad weather. A few birds fly 
quickly overhead, fast enough to avoid any predators in the sky, 
and high enough as not to be snagged by a hidden danger in the 
grass. 
   The shoreline of the River Anduin turns here from north to 
east, whilst to the west a dense birch woodland lies.

Vegetated Shore of the River Anduin~
   Here the countryside of Anorien reaches the south-western bank 
of the great River Anduin. Composed mainly of sand and dirt 
mixed with the occasional scattering of stone and rock, it slopes 
easily into the swiftly flowing river to the east. Tall grass 
begins just before the shore to the west before spreading out 
into the farmland and roads of the landscape of Northern Gondor. 
The vegetation of this south-western shore of the River Anduin 
increases as it heads towards the west, nearing a birch woodland. 
   An old, run-down windmill looks over the river, a fenced-in 
field below it.

rustlings and scampering movements of small forest creatures can 
be heard occasionally in this clearing, the dense layer of 
smaller plants and trees around the feet having been moved back 
around a shallow firepit in the middle. To the east is a narrow, 
near invisible path through the thick undergrowth and gnarled 
treeroots that leads away from the clearing and into the larger

A Dirt Trail Before a Squat, Stone Bastion~
   A trail made of dirt follows from the west to the east, where 
it comes to a stop before a squat, stone bastion. The ground has 
been heavily trampled by many feet over a long period of time, as 
well as wagons and horses. To the north and south the woodlands 
and hills of Anorien extend outwards. And in the distance the 
Anduin River can be seen to the northwest. A pair of lamps hang 
from the Bastion's walls above its door provide the area with 
some light. The trail continues around to the south and behind 
the bastion, following the stone walls. A small plot of land has 
been fenced off with iron rails to on the northern side of this 
trail.

Shady Grove Around a Clear Pond~
   A number of various kinds of tree form a pleasant, shady grove 
here, many of them willows. Their branches trail down into the 
crystal-clear waters of a pond nearby. The pond is more or less 
round, with reeds sprouting up on one side, and the grass all 
about is luscious and a green. Leading away from the pond is a 
narrow stream that wends its way towards the great Anduin River 
to the northeast. The birchwoods encompass the grove thickly, 
preventing passage out by any means other than the little stream.

predators. The woods thin out to the south and west, giving way 
to more cultivated fields and farmlands.

   Leading northwards and away from the Lond Forodren-Annui, this 
gravel path comes right up to the front entrance of the 
two-storey Inn here. It is quite wide and looks to have been 
well-used by people, horses and wagons. It is lined on either 
side by a low fence, and several lanterns hang from posts to 
illuminate the path after the sun goes down. 
   Carriages stop here to drop off visitors from Minas Tirith or 
from Cair Andros across the river from Amdir where the Army of 
Gondor is based. The travel is in both directions and many use 
this point to stop for a tankard or to visit the Wardogs 
marketplace, then travel on.

The Pelennor Fields Near the Lond Forodren-Annui~
   From here a vantage point of the vast and varied landscape of 
the Pelennor Fields is offered to the eye. The land has been 
divided by the numerous fences and dirt roads criss-crossing 
through it, different crops being grown showing through as 
different colours, as well as green grass of fallow fields and 
yellow of areas in need of rain. The odd tree and hillock occur 
time from time among the Fields, along with farmsteads housing 
those that work upon them to produce all sorts of agricultural 
products. The looming figure of Mount Mindolluin lies in the 
distant to the west, its craggy slopes clearly visible. The 
white-cobbled Lond Forodren-Annui can be seen not far to the west 
and south. A lightly wooded meadow reveals a wooden cabin.

Grassy Trail Before a Stone Bastion~
   The grassy trail comes to a halt before the large wooden 
barn-doors of the Bastion. Lanterns hang from the walls, 
providing plenty of light when in darkness, and the trail is 
bordered on the west and south by a wooden fence. To the west, 
south and east the expanse of the Pelennor Fields can be see, 
while the walls of the bastion rise up high to the north.
 
   A squat, log building sits just a few yards further
to the west.

around the bastion to the west and then north. A flagpole 
bearing a large pennant is fixed proudly above the western 
doorway. The flag bears the image of a sword before a 
seven-pointed star, the symbol of Greathouse Astirian.

Grassy Fields Near the Lond Forodren-Annui~
   Fertile soil gives growth to a multitude of things in the 
Pelennor Fields, to the green grass on the hills and fallows 
fields, to the numerous crops of wheat, barley, beans and other 
such things and to the grazing land for the herds of cattle and 
sheep that occupy the Fields. As they expand outwards in all 
directions, contained only by the Mount Mindolluin to the west 
and the Rammas Echor that forms their boundaries, the Pelennor 
Fields contain within them much of the agricultural production 
for Northern Gondor and the city Minas Tirith. In several 
directions, the Lond Forodren-Annui borders the farmlands, its 
white cobblestones lined with lanterns on posts to light the road 
at night.

On the Shore of the River Anduin~
   With a slight inward curve, the River Anduin keeps to the 
northern bank, flowing alongside in an easy, fluid manner. 
Easily sloping underwater, the dirt mixed sand is lapped by the 
swiftly moving river. The bank extends the width of twenty feet 
or so, breaking suddenly into thin, knee-high grass which waves 
with the movement of the air about it. Small animals dart in and 
out of the grass, leave tracks in the mud and then disappear as 
quickly as they appeared.

A Stretch of the Yard, Rounding a Burnt-Down Cabin~
   A portion of the yard cleared to the east branches away here, 
dotted with wild vegetation and a sparse collection of trees 
which grow denser and more numerous in all directions. An 
extension of the burnt-down cabin resides here, also collapsed
and set ablaze in the past. The walls of shed are more in-tact
than those of the cabin, but the roof seems to have been
completely engulfed and turned to ash long ago.

Gravel Road Before A Large Stone Building~
   Here is a wide, freshly built gravel road that branches 
southwards from the Lond Caras-Mir, cutting through the fields 
towards a high stone structure rising up to the south. The walls 
of Osgiliath are visible to the northeast and the sounds of the 
mighty Anduin River can be heard not too far away both east and 
south, beyond the irrigated farmlands and fallow fields all 
about. The road ends at two large double-doors that lead into 
the stone building. From the walls above the doors hang a pair 
of lanterns, to shed light upon the entrance during the night.

east and west, the inner walls of the barracks rise upwards, and 
a large gate leads soutwards to a wide pasture. North of the 
arena is an open archway leading into the ante-room, while on the 
eastern and western sides are the stables for the horses. The 
arena is open to the sky and its surface is of coarse, brown 
sand. Lanterns set on poles around it provide it will ample 
light at any given time.

though, despite some medium sixed holes in the walls where the 
boards don't fit together. The roof slopes down towards the back

and trees around the feet providing cover against larger 
predators.

Dense Birch Woods~
   Birch trees heavily populate this patch of woods. Older, more 
dominating birches spread their expansive canopies over the 
younger, struggling saplings. While not thick enough to impede 
travel, the encompassing undergrowth, composed of varied bushes 
intertwined with snake-like vines, is substantial enough to hide 
the multitudes of wild critters that make it their home. 
   To the east the birch trees quickly thin out, giving way to 
the farmlands of Anorien. In all other directions the trees 
continue.

Woods Approaching the Shores of a River~
   Tall birch trees with smooth, silver bark clamber up towards 
the sky here, their drooping branches interwoven so thickly that 
during the day light from the sun must filter past the small, 
green, edged leaves. A thick undergrowth of various shrubs and 
plants, as well as younger birch saplings, crowds around the base 
of the wide trunks of the birches, slowing movement through this 
area. 
   Eastwards the shore of a river lies, the woodlands quickly 
disperses as it approaches the water, whilst to the north the 
trees continue right to the water. The burnt remains of a large 
birch tree stand amidst others.

Wooded South Shore of the Anduin River~
   Numerous birch trees rise up high overhead here, forcing those 
who travel through this area to negotiate over the large roots 
and felled trees. Moss and other lichen grow at the base of the 
trees, whilst upward along their trunks sits the silver bark of 
the birch, feeling smooth to the touch. Green toothed leaves 
hang from the drooping branches of the trees here, some 
interwoven in a woodland canopy. 
   The trees end abruptly to the north-east as the dark waters of 
the River Anduin flow past the roots of the birch trees that have 
extended out into the river.

Birch Tree Canopy Over the Forested River Shore~
   A thick canopy of boughs and other smaller branches of the 
tall birch trees here has been woven between the many mature 
trees that sprout up from the ground here. The quiet rustlings 
and scampering movements of small forest creatures can be heard 
occasionally in this woodland, the dense layer of smaller plants 
and trees around the feet providing cover against larger 
predators. 
   The forested shore of the River Anduin continues to the west 
and south, the fast flowing currents of the river flowing past 
the large roots of the birch trees set in the waters.

By the Rammas Echor North of a Road ~
   The countryside of Anorien, a fiefdom of northern Gondor, ends 
abruptly to the west here. A wall over twice the height of a 
normal man and constructed from blocks of white stone prevents 
any further movement in that direction, the lands beyond them 
known as the Pelennor Fields. Leading up to the wall, known as 
the Rammas Echor, the vegetation thins before becoming little 
more then dirt at the base of its formation. 
   Northwards the Rammas Echor runs and approaches corner in its 
formation, while to the south a broad stone road runs out from a 
gate set in the wall.

Corner of the Stone Wall as it Leads West and South~
   Stretching many miles from south to west, the Rammas Echor 
signals the end of the Gondorian fiefdom of Anorien here. Built 
from large blocks of white stone, the crenulated battlements are 
constantly patrolled by heavily armed soldiers ensuring the 
safety of the lands inside the walls to the south. The 
vegetation here consists mainly of dirt and patches of grass, but 
in the distance to the north and east farmlands can be seen. 
   A corner in the Rammas Echor develops here, shifting the 
course of the wall from west to south.

Fertile Landscape~
   A rustic atmosphere lies settled over the countryside of 
Anorien, those lands west of the River Anduin and north of the 
cathedral Minas Tirith. The labours of agriculture spread out 
for the eye to see, farmers caring for their crops and shepherds 
managing their herds during the day, and at night the villages 
and farmsteads that dot the land casting out points of light in 
the distance. A few travellers can be seen moving through the 
tended lands rather than walk upon the more crowded highways that 
cut through Anorien. 
   In all directions of the compass point the lands of Anorien 
continue as far as the eye can see. A log farm house is here 
amidst the fields.

Rolling Hills and Grassy Plains~
   While not overly so, the lands of Anorien are fertile enough 
to provide a decent livelihood to the farmers that tend to the 
land and their livestock upon it. Bordered to the north and east 
by the wide River Anduin, the countryside of Northern Gondor is 
peaceful at most times as its inhabitants go about their daily 
business. The colossal shape of Mount Mindolluin is always 
present to the south-west, as are the White Mountains that 
stretch out further beyond it. 
   No matter which way one turns the landscape of Anorien 
continues in front of them. Slightly to the west, a recently
refurbished farmstead sits in the fields.

landscape of fields and gentle green hills. The regular patrol 
of soldiers belonging to the local lords of the land upon the 
roads and highways that cut through Northern Gondor ensures that

Sparsely Vegetated Ground at a Stone Wall~
   The normal grass and farmland of the lands of Anorien come to 
a halt as they reach the base of the Rammas Echor, the mighty 
stone wall that acts as the first layer of defence to the city of 
Minas Tirith that lies within. There are few holdings in front 
of the walls, the land periodically cleared by soldiers of the 
city to ensure any enemy attacking is deprived of cover of any 
sort. The tended land of Anorien lies to the north. 
   The Rammas Echor runs west and east, the stretch of dirt in 
front of it extending in both directions.

Thick Copse of Birch Trees~
   Tall birch trees with smooth, silver bark clamber up towards 
the sky here, their drooping branches interwoven so thickly that 
during the day light from the sun must filter past the small, 
green, edged leaves. A thick undergrowth of various shrubs and 
plants, as well as younger birch saplings, crowds around the base 
of the wide trunks of the birches, slowing movement through this 
area. 
   In all directions the birch trees continue on.

Birch Woodland~
   Birch trees heavily populate this patch of woods. Older, more 
dominating birches spread their expansive canopies over the 
younger, struggling saplings. While not thick enough to impede 
travel, the encompassing undergrowth, composed of varied bushes 
intertwined with snake-like vines, is substantial enough to hide 
the multitudes of wild critters that make it their home. 
   The woodland thins as it heads south and west, a dirt trail 
running by it to the south. The vegetation progresses in to 
north and east.

trees, whilst upward along their trunks sits the silver bark of 
the birch, feeling smooth to the touch. Green toothed leaves 
hang from the drooping branches of the trees here, some 
interwoven in a woodland canopy. 
   No matter which way one turns, past the trees in the immediate 
vicinity lie more of the smooth-barked trees.

of short trees grow off in the distance - a rare sight in the 
wide plains of Anorien. The landscape is lended colour by the 
rich green of the tended land nearby, most of the developed 
property gathering to the north, where a single band of brown 
interrupts the continuous flow of the plains.
   Judging by the increasing traffic, a trail lies ahead to the
north.

A Wide, Pebbly Yard~
   Cleared from the tall trees that surround the area, this wide 
yard is strewn with small rocks and pebbles. A low stone wall 
embraces a disused yard, while a two-story wooden building leans 
against the mountain here, looking weather-worn. Here and there 
can be seen crates, mining tools, and other signs of the work 
that must have taken place in the area.

A Disused Yard~
Through an opening in a low stone wall stands the remnants of

ground, leaving only dusty bare earth with the occasional 
scraggly weed vying for survival. The yard continues to the south 
and a gate blocks passage to the west.

wooden gate leads out to a pebbly yard to the south.

A Cluttered Wood-Walled Room~
   This cluttered room seems to serve a multitude of purposes, 
being an office, kitchen, bedroom, and storeroom all rolled into 
one. It is kept as tidy as possible but still ends up being very 
cluttered and difficult to navigate. A narrow wooden stairway in 
the northwestern corner leads upward, while a door stands to the 
east.

A Large Barn Made into an Events Hall~
   The floors and walls of this hall are made of wood, The once 
rich beige hue now dulled and chipping. Hay and straw are strewn 
across the floor, providing insulation against the elements as 
well as padding in case of a fall. Strung across the ceiling are 
numerous strings of colorful paper lanterns adding a soft, and 
cheery glow when lit though they are now covered in dust and 
cobwebs, the paper of the lanterns hardened and very fragile. 
Large and expansive, this hall is roomy enough to accomodate 
several people and lining the walls are a few benches and bales 
of hay for seating.

Cramped, Walk-In Pantry~
   This walk-in pantry has grown stale and moldy, the aged 
foodstuffs sending horrible tendrils of a dirty aroma out to 
every nose. This room has gone largely untouched from the fire 
that engulfed most of the building. Time has not been kind to it 
none the less, as the ceiling has caved in exposing it to the 
elements and to the rotting nature of wood when left untreated.

A Modest Bedroom~
   Pine forms the walls and eaved roof of this modestly sized 
room. The floorboards have been carved from maple wood, and 
stained bringing out the rich grain of the wood. The walls 
themselves have been painted a pale gold color, which in the 
evening sun reflects its colors around the interior of the room 
warmly. An orange-red cherrywood trim has been nailed to the 
corner posts as well as running along the walls at about waist 
height. Great detail appears to have been put into the carving 
of an interwoven vine and rosebud pattern on this cherrywood 
trim. There is a single window on the east wall hung with 
sea-green linen drapes.

A Cottage Garden~
   A narrow dirt pathway winds through this serene little garden, 
arching branches of a tall cherry tree casting dappled shade over 
the blossoms and evergreens beneath. Occasionally, the wind 
picks up and whistles as it passes through these branches, 
joining the gentle burble of the Anduin to the east. At the end 
of the path is a small cottage with two windows, one either side 
of its darkly-hued timber door. A small stone chimney juts out 
at one end of the building.

   This long common room is often bathed in sunlight due to the 
large windows facing out over the orchards and toward the fields 
to the north. The curtains are almost permanently drawn back, 
allowing the light in to warm a smooth, stone floor fashioned 
from compacted grey river-rocks. At the eastern most end of the 
room, a modest river-rock fireplace stands below a polished 
dark-wood mantelpiece. The same dark grain of timber has been 
used for both doors, north and south.

Stream Fields Cabin~
   A path of well-kept grass leads through a large yard here in 
the fields, home to a quaint cabin nestled off the stream's 
wildflowers, their colors intermingled hap-hazardly. The 
darkened hardwood logs that form this cabin are sturdy and thick, 
nearly a man's arm in diameter and dove-tailed to fit tightly 
together. The roof is tiled and tarred, angled to slope to the 
front and back with a brick chimney along the eastern side. A 
sturdy, step-up porch leads from the path to the solid door. 
Windows dot the sides of the cabin, shuttered with wood and 
curtained on the cabin's western side to a small shed. A more 
travelled path of trampled grass leads around the shore.

On the Side of the Cabin~
   Situated alongside the western flank of a sturdy cabin, this 
portion of yard is covered in a thick carpet of wildflowers. A 
path leads eastward around toward the cabin's front, and also to 
a small shed. Windowless, the shed is sturdy, and fashioned from 
planks of hardwood similar in appearance to the larger logs that 
make up the cabin nearby.

Inside the Cabin~
   The interior of this cabin has been formed of finished planks 
of hardwood, designed to conceal the exterior logs and plaster 
between them. The floor is also formed from finished hardwood 
planks, polished and laquered to a glossy shine. A pair of 
windows lie along the southern wall, their sills carpentered with 
scrolling designs running along their edge. Billowing, deep-blue 
curtains hung on plain rods above. Comfortable, this room is 
home to the cabin's massive fireplace, elaborately constructed of 
smooth stones found from the stream that can be heard running 
year-round to the north. A steep stairwell leads to a loft up 
above.

Climbing Hills, at the Base of Mindolluin~
   The land of the Pelennor lifts sharply here, climbing towards 
the apex of Mount Mindolluin to the west, the rolling hills here 
dwarfed by the mountain's enormity. The hills are spotted with 
low brush and sparse woodland. The eastern horizon is mostly 
clear, proffering a stunning view of the Pelennor fields as they 
stretch on to the banks of a distant Anduin, too far away to 
glimpse. The air here is cool, even during the summer months, 
and the hills are often swept with wild mountain wind.

Before a Stone Cottage~
   A small stretch of Pelennor Fields has been fenced in here, 
forming the front gardens of a stone cottage along a trail to the 
north. The cottage is flat but broad, fashioned of wood and 
sun-baked stone. The circling fence is coloured a deep green, 
the paint worn and flaking with age. A gap in it to the south 
leads back out into the board fields of Pelennor. A wide, stone 
path leads from the southern gate up to the house, then branches 
off in a smooth curve around the house to the east and west. A 
grassy sitting area is at the corner where the path bends, 
surrounded by a bed of wildflowers, bright with colors. 
Ornamental ivy and rose shrubs grow on either side of the sitting 
area, room for a bench between them.

few pieces of furniture dot the enclosure, clustered about a

sporting a triangular, thatched roof, fronted by a wide porch 
with an overhang supported by thick oak posts.

of furniture, mostly clustered about the fireplace set into the 
northern wall. Shuttered windows proffer light during the 
daytime and privacy at night. A door exits out into another room 
to the east, while a second leads southward to the garden 
outside.

A Private Room Within a Cabin~
   This private bedchamber, kept quite quiet by the thick wooden 
walls of the log cabin, has a stale earthy aroma. Furniture 
tossed about among piles of rubbish leaving a thin trail clear 
for feet from the western door to the bed, a few of the heavily 
scratched and dented floorboards clearly visible, one in 
particular squeaking loudly whenever a careless step lands on it. 
Above the bed a wide window has been nailed shut though a 
tarnished sconced glass lamp beside it offers scattered light 
after nightfall.

The Logging Camp~
   This large yard is lively with the movement and shouts of 
laborers hauling freshly cut logs and setting them to be turned 
into lumbers at the lumbermill, which fills the air with a 
constant roar of metal on wood. The packed-dirt of the yard show 
the marks of a constant traffic by small carts or wagons. A 
large gate allows one to return to the Pelennor, while the sounds 
of the lumberyard are constant through the day. A wide, strong 
set of doors give way to what seems a warehouse to the west, 
while a small, simple door to the north allows entry to a squat 
building, made of logs. The lumbermill stands to the south, 
easily entered by through a wide, wooden arch.

The Pelennor Lumbermill~
   This area is full with the buzz of the sawmill, reaching
a deafening level . This complex piece of machinery is a mass 
of metal cogs, wheels and sawblades, fed with the power of 
the nearby brook, propelling it into life to work the hefty logs
that are set to it. The smell of oil and water used to cool the 
blades mixes with the strong smells of the wood chips which 
cover the floor. Logs and long lengths of cut timbers are 
orderly set around the floor, either to be taken into the 
warehouse for storage or readied to be cut at the mill.

A Rustic Common Room~
   This simple, rustic room is part of a squat, midsized building
fashioned with thick logs from the nearby woods. The floor, 
stained by the passage of men and the weather outside, has 
been given a cursory sanding and sealing. The walls, made of 
thick logs, still sporting the bark in some parts, have been 
nailed, lashed and isolated using clay and dirt, staving off the 
effects of the cold. The roof is also made of long timbers, 
which have been somewhat water-proofed, keeping the 
elements at bay. A door to the south allows return to the 
camp's yard, while two simple doors west give way east 
to the barrack and west to the small kitchen and mess.

timbers, and a stone chimney, cemented with mortar, 
allows a cook to prepare varied foods. A small iron stove 
is set in the western wall, connected to a fireplace where 
different foods can be prepared. The northern wall has 
series of simple shelves, and a large window, sawed off
the southern wall, can be opened to ventilate the 
smoky quality of this kitchen. The only exit is back
into the common room to the east.

laborers of the logging operation. The logs have been 
somewhat worked on to allow a less rugged appearance, 
and insulated from the elements using clay and hay. A 
few simple beds have been set to allow rest, and the 
southern wall has a shuttered window that permits air
to flow in easily. The floor is somewhat better than the 
rest of the building, having been sanded and varnished,
free of splinters and insulated from the ground. The 
common room can be entered through the sturdy
door to the west.

   The large, airy area of this rustic warehouse is full

are stored here. The walls are made of rough, thick local
logs secured and lashed together, with no flooring. Light 
comes, in the day, from a pair of tall windows on the 
eastern wall, over the wide doors that permit the entry. 
The timbers and logs are stacked neatly, arranged by type
of wood, which allows for the easy loading of any vehicle
used to haul the materials outside.

apple trees towards an eastern bend in the track, beyond which 
one can see several buildings, and some enclosed fields. A 
sign is set across two high wooden posts, beneath which one 
passes into the farmstead. To the south are the broad fields of 
the Pelennor.

  This well-kept, packed-earth yard has a wide cobbled path 
leading to the east and south, where a house with a single wide 
door stretches across the yard. There are windows on both 
storeys of the building. To the south a five-bar gate allows 
access to a paddock. To the north, a large barn stands, closed 
doors barring further access. Birdsong and the chatter of small 
animals surround this yard during all but the harshest of 
seasons.

   This simple, functional kitchen has been recently repaired, as 
has the rest of the cottage. With a decently-sized fireplace and 
a stone floor, meals can be easily prepared here. Ventilation is 
provided by a squat, small window, facing east onto a path. One 
can exit through a curtain to the south, into the rest of the 
cottage, or downwards by opening a sturdy trapdoor, that has been 
set on the ground.

   Dug out of the ground, this cramped cellar's walls are lined 
with stone while the earthen floor has been left exposed. Poor 
ventilation gives the air a stale, musty smell. Some cobwebs 
can be seen hanging from the ceiling and a thin layer of dust 
covers the places where things remain for too long. A small 
wooden ladder leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling.

A Small, Dirt Yard~
   This small, dirt yard is surrounded by a pair of log-walled 
buildings. To the west, through a squat door stands some sort of 
large building. East, a squat log building carries smells of 
yeast and brewing. The view from the top of the hill is 
impressive, looking over the fields and quilted farmlands 
northwards. A gate set in the northern fence leads down a gentle 
slope to the Pelennor. Southwards a copse is clear to see, 
thickening to the southwest.

local woods, leashed, nailed and isolated to keep the elements 
from the inhabitants. The floor has also been made of long, 
planed and simply sanded timbers, while thick beams support the 
roof, also fashioned with wooden shingles. Although the place is 
humble in construction, it is quite fitting for any outdoorsman, 
heat provided by a simple fireplace of stone, set in the northern 
wall. A curtain leads east into what must be a kitchen, from the 
savory smells that emanate from there. A sturdy pine door allows 
for the leaving back into the yard to the west.

Contained in the room is all manners of devices used by the men 
and women of the Hawk and Dove and the Cadre to hone their 
skills. Archery butts, straw dummies, sparring rings, ropes and 
more have been placed about the large barn-sized room. The roof 
is low and a series of lanterns suspended from it brighten the 
room. An iron-banded door blocks exit to the west.

what used to be the old hayloft. The original pair of hayloft 
doors remain here in the western wall, forming a half-moon shape 
and are firmly barred and nailed shut. Four windows are set 
along the eastern wall. It has been recently converted to be 
used as a dormitory, and looks like it could sleep twenty people 
with ease. A hatch leads down to the bottom of the barn and the 
remainder of the dormitory stretches away southwards. 
   A recently added iron-banded thick oak door is set into the 
northern wall, itself reinforced with large stone slabs.

   Packed earth and clay make up the walls, floors and ceiling of 
this long and narrow tunnel. Barely high enough to crouch in, it 
ducks down then rises, clearly meant as a passage rather than a 
place for storage or dwelling. The air is damp and heavy. 
Insects and rodents clearly make their home here. At the 
northern end of the tunnel are five clay steps leading to a 
smooth wooden door of vertical panels. At the southern end a 
wooden hatch hangs down on large ceiling hinges nailed deep into 
the clay and soil. Brambles and branches can be seen pushing at

surrounding farmers can be seen to the east and south. A small 
path leads from the north side of the field, through a gap in the 
fence. A cottage can be seen to the northwest.

A Fenced Field in Anorien~
   This orchard of roughly an acre is bordered by a wooden fence. 
Some apiaries buzz with bees among the fruit trees. A path leads 
south and north into another fields and farm buildings can be

Meadow Downs~
   On the northern edge of this tiny clearing is built a cabin 
smelling of curing birch wood. A faint path has been trodden 
through the tall grass sprinkled with meadow flowers, and leads 
to a metal-banded oaken door, the iron still bright. A small 
window with snug blue shutters is visible to the right of the 
door. A second window with the same color shutters is seen on 
the loft rising above the main cabin, the shake-covered roof 
slanting down from the front to the back of the building to allow 
snow to slide off in the winter.

A Common Room In A Cabin~
   Wooden panels made of white pine cover the walls of this 
pleasant common room, sanded smooth and still smelling of 
varnish. On one side of the metal-banded oaken door a small 
window trimmed with maple looks out onto the grassy clearing 
outside, and on the other side is a row of pegs at head height. 
A fireplace lined with evenly mortared red brick takes up the 
middle of the west wall, the chimney extending up through the 
ceiling. The floor is laid with pine planks, sanded to a smooth 
finish and stained a light golden yellow. On the west a 
ladder-like staircase of golden stained pine leads upwards to a 
trap door. A varnished pine door stained the same color as the 
floor leads into another room to the north.

of the west wall is the column of a red-bricked chimney leading 
from the room below to the roof and providing warmth in the

A Large Open Cavern~
   Whether by nature or by the hand of some ancient miner, the 
cavern walls here fan out in all directions, forming a sizable 
cave. The lichen covered walls glow with a soft blue light, 
offering sufficient lighting, if barely, to see by. In the

table rises out from the rough floor, strange glyphs marring its

   The walls of this squarish room clearly display the scars from 
ancient picks and chisels. Narrow gouges run along the northern 
face, where excavated stone was sheared away. Along the southern

containing panes of glass, as is its sloping roof - this though 
is washed with a thin coat of whitewash, which prevents Anor's 
rays from burning all within. The glasshouse is lined with waist

center sits a small stone well. The northern path leads to the 
front of the farmhouse. The house is made of simple pinewood and 
has a slightly slanted roof. The path branching east leads to a 
small barnyard situated between a moderately sized pinewood barn 
and the farm's several fields. To the south a path leads to the 
gate in the fence that seperates the farm from the rest of the 
Pelennor Fields. A little way to the west a path leads to a 
small garden, and beyond that another structure can be seen.

A Cozy Farmhouse Room~
   This cozy, warm square room is a moderate sized with a high 
ceiling. The walls consist of pine planks, save for the stone 
work around the freshly built in chimney of smooth, grey river 
rocks bound together with mortar which rises up the southern wall 
from the fireplace. The floor consist of moderately sized stones 
that are somewhat uneven. A small window has been set into the 
southern wall to provide light during the day. A trapdoor has 
been set in the floor on eastern side of the house while a sturdy 
door has been set in the southern wall. Freshly built doors now 
rest to the east, and north. The east door leads to a bedroom , 
while the one to the north to a storage area. A grayish woolen 
curtain in the west leads to the kitchen.

Some Well-Tended Fields~
   These fields are well cared for, whether it is during the 
growing season of spring or the harsh coldness of winter. 
Whether they are just starting to sprout, near ready to be 
harvested, or lying fallow for the winter, these fields have been 
cleared of rocks and debris, and are constantly under the 
attention of the farmhands that work them.

A Pinewood Barn~
This moderately sized barn is built from pinewood, and even 
after so long the scent of the wood mingles with that of the 
animals housed within. Stalls line either side of the wall from 
the large front double-doors to the rear, where a curtained 
doorway leads to storage. To either side of this doorway, some 
space has been made for a more immediate storage.

One of the stalls seems to be used for storage.

A Squat Storage Shed ~
   Ruggedly built and bearing the signs of years of use, this 
squat, windowless shed is built for function instead of beauty. 
With barely enough room for one to move about, it is compact, 
featuring several hooks and nails, capable of supporting various 
tools and objects. Overhead, a low-hanging loft allows for 
larger things to be put up out of the way. A sturdy door leads 
southwards towards the horseyard.

Hillfoot Cabin~
   In the northeast corner of the tiny clearing a snugly built 
cabin is visible, the smell of curing birch still discernable, 
indicating its newness. A thin earthen path has been beaten here 
by traffic leading through the flower sprinkled clearing to a 
bright metal-banded oaken door. To the right of the door is a 
small window with freshly painted white shutters. Above the main 
cabin is visible a loft with a shake-covered slanted roof, to 
allow accumulated snow to slide off in the winter. Inset into 
the center of the loft wall is a window with white shutters 
matching the window on the main level.

A Common Room In A Cabin~
   Paneled in white pine sanded smooth and varnished, this 
restful common room still smells of pine. On one side of the 
metal-banded oaken door is a small maple trimmed window that 
provides a view of the grassy clearing outside, while on the 
other side a row of pegs has been set at head height. The floor 
has been laid down with planks of pine, sanded to smoothness and 
stained a light golden yellow. A chimney of tidily mortared red 
brick set in the western wall, extends through the ceiling down 
to a brick-lined fireplace. On the east wall a ladder-like 
staircase of golden stained pine leads upwards to a trap door. A 
pine door, stained and varnished to match the floor is visible on 
the northern wall.

   Creamy white streaks run through the grey stones that have 
been roughly flattened and fitted to make the floor of this small 
pleasant kitchen. To the west a window edged in maple shows a 
view of the birch trees edging the clearing, letting in light to 
illuminate the room during the daytime. In the northwest corner 
of the room a small stove has been placed, a metal pipe extending 
to the roof to let out smoke. Against the north wall an oblong

enough for the majority of people to stand upright, but slanting 
down to an area about half that height. Up the middle of the 
west wall extends the stack of a red-bricked chimney that 
provides wintertime warmth. Stained a golden brown, the floor is 
made of planks of white pine, sanded and stained a light golden 
brown. Through the small maple edged window in the south wall, a 
pleasant view is provided of the grassy clearing before the 
cabin. A bed has been pushed against the wall to the east.

Craggy Meadow Cabin~
   This lightly wooded meadow has been well trod in the past, but 
now hints of wild grasses and other vegetation are beginning to 
show. A small garden has become overgrown with weeds. Broad 
pine trees shade a patched wooden cabin sealed with dark pitch. 
A roof of weathered wooden roof tiles shows signs of recent 
repair and the door appears to be made of well sanded and lightly 
varnished oak. 
   The gravel trail continues toward the door of the cabin and a 
well worn path leads to a small outbuilding. In all other 
directions the Pelennor fields can be seen.

A Comfortable Living Area~
   This large main room serves as a general living room, with 
short steps leading up through a hatch to a sleeping area. A 
stone fireplace warms the room in cooler months and shuttered 
windows allow for the airing of the cabin on warmer days. A high 
ceiling gives the room an open feel. The air carries a faint 
odor of musk and burnt wood. 
   A window lends a view of the meadow to the south, while drapes 
hang over a doorway to the north.

Before the Steps of a Stone Manor House~
   A winding path rises up from the surrounding fields here, 
cresting the low bend of a hill to come to an end at the doors of 
a small manor house to the east. The homestead itself is a low, 
broad, brick structure, set with a pair of squat glass windows 
that reveal little of the building's interior. Another path 
bends away from the steps to the house's entry, snaking southward 
where it ends at the gate to a large plowed field, surrounded by 
a tall fence. To the west, the fields of the Pelennor stretch on 
to the horizon, clearly visible from the vantage the hill here 
provides.

   A small, rectangular common hall opens here, the flat, 
wood-beamed ceiling lifted high above to lend it an airy 
atmosphere. The floors and walls here are fashioned of grey 
brick, and are sparsely decorated, the room sporting a few choice 
pieces of furniture. An open archway to the east leads into a 
kitchen of the same construction, the entryway set beside a tall 
fireplace that lies central along the eastern wall. To the 
south, several steps lead down to a broad doorway, while a 
similar door is set into the northern wall, bordered by a thick 
wooden frame. A gently curving stone staircase hugs the 
southeastern corner of the room, climbing up to landing above. A 
pair of windows border the doors along the western wall, 
proffering a clear view of the surrounding fields in the 
daylight.

Amidst Fenced-In, Fertile Fields~

main sections and plowed during the warmer months. Occasionally 
a workman can be glimpsed, attending to their duties. A barn can 
be spotted in the distance to the northeast, erected close to the 
boundaries established by the broad wooden fence that encircles 
the entire area. To the north, the fields narrow into a 
cobble-lined path that ends at the steps to a stone manor house. 
To the west lies a wrought iron gate in the fence, that exits out 
onto a small pathway.

well-illuminated, both in the daytime by way of a pair of broad 
windows set upon the eastern wall, and at night by the glow of 
the room's sconced lamps, when they are lit. A squat stone 
fireplace is nestled into the room's southwestern corner, 
providing heat during the cool winter months, and the floor is 
padded with rugs for further comfort. A narrow, oak-framed 
doorway is also set into the western door, proffering entry to

   A path of beaten dirt snakes along the edge of a wide stone 
manor house, bordered on either side by wild grasses, and shaded 
by the boughs of scattered trees in the daylight. The path stops 
as it bends eastward, halting at a squat gate of wrought iron, 
and the beginnings of a tall log fence. Beyond the fence plowed 
fields are visible, a low barn erected in their midst. The path 
continues northward, where it leads to the entry of the house 
that it borders.

A Quiet Cemetery North of a Squat, Stone Bastion~
   Resting in quiet peace, this small cemetery lies at the 
northern foot of a squat bastion built of stone. The plot 
contains several rows of headstones, some of which stand over 
fresh graves. At the end of each row, a tree has been planted, 
presiding over those laid to rest within this silent cemetery 
shadowed by the stone wall of the bastion. Protecting the graves 
from roaming animals, a tall, iron fence of simple design 
surround them, with a gate set in the southern section. A pair 
of stoic guards remains against the Bastion wall, constantly 
watching this serene and peaceful cemetery.

Under an Archway In the Curving Trail~
   Windswept clumps of short grass cling onto the mountainside on 
the eastern side of this trail, the western edge falling away 
treacherously. The trail continues straight to the south, but to 
the north it begins to wind slightly eastwards and dips towards 
some woodland. 
   The northern trail leads under a crumbling archway of rock, 
seemingly recently fallen away judging by the debris on either 
side. Beyond, high rock spires and shoulders of Mindolluin 
stretch up between a series of valleys and sharply ascending 
trails.

belly of Mindolluin. Looking off to the north and east, the

the woodland ends. A steep rock climb blocks the way westwards.

Sloping Pine Woodland~
   Sloping down to the east, the woodland begins to thicken in 
that direction. To the north it stretches away, with little sign 
of life. The mountain rises to the south, lichen and the mineral 
streaks from decades of rainfall clinging onto a sheer rise and 
blocking any movement. Pine needles form a thick blanket and 
little else grows here.

Thick Canopied Woodland~
   Pale pine needles form a thick blanket across this part of the 
woods, stunted shrubs pushing up here and there, seeking light 
and finding little. Looking above, a dizzying number of tall 
pine trees stretch up towards the mountain skies. While the tall 
lodgepole pine trunks thin in density to the south and west, here 
they are closely packed, making movement slow.

Thick Canopy of Pine Trees~
   Southwards a thinning in the woods is visible, while to the 
west a sheer drop over the edge of the mountainside is marked by 
crumbling soil and an old aspen leaning out over it at a 
precarious angle. Here, the pines are deeply packed, with any 
fast movement difficult. The green and yellow leaves and needles 
high above add to the lack of light and sense that the air is 
here is stale and old.

Thick Pine Wood~
   In all directions the closely packed pine trees stretch, with 
the canopy holding in what warmth it can, resulting in a deep 
stillness below and little light. Small creatures dart around or 
freeze and sniff if anyone passes, but silence is the predominant 
feature. Any attempt to push through the thick woodland echoes 
out in all directions eerily.

   The woods stretch out in all directions except to the south, 
where a recess among the sheer mountainside offers some respite 
from pine needles and woodland. Here, apparent rockfalls have 
left all sizes of stones and boulders scattered here, some 
revealing the path of their fall through shattered branches high 
above, but most now covered in a dull yellow lichen or soil, with 
new sapling springing from them.

A Rocky Recess~
   Nestled behind a small grove of long-leaved rhododendrons, a 
horseshoe-shaped recess in the otherwise sheer mountainside 
pushes back from a pine woodland to the north. The ground is 
tilted upwards amongst jutting rocks and boulders. A small cave 
to the south sits darkly, surrounded by granite outcroppings. 
Near the cave, when turning and looking to the north, the canopy 
of the pine woods is seen, as if looking out across a dark grassy 
plain. Mount Mindolluin stretches beyond it, snow-capped and 
mighty.

   This large spacious room plays host to a couple of small beds, 
which line the eastern and western walls, each of which has a 
small, trunk placed at their foot. The bare floor is painted a 
light gray and has been scuffed and scratched through everyday 
wear and tear. The walls have been painted a tidy shade of pale 
cream, and are bare, and devoid of any other type of treatment 
whatsoever. Within the southern end of the room is a large 
window, showing an expansive view, with simple blue curtains 
hanging from either side of the window pane. Set in the northern 
wall, near the middle of the room, is a heavy door of 
lightly-stained oak.

Amidst the Pine Woodland~
   The air is heavy and sound is muffled as pine trunks rise high 
above in great numbers all around, giving way to a dark canopy. 
Pine needles lay here, rustling underfoot as insects move in 
countless numbers. A single row of small oblong stones, about 
knee height, stick up prominently above the pine needles. 
   Strange runes are chipped into their sides: whorls and curves. 
It is impossible to estimate how long they have stood here in the 
still woodlands.

Inclining Woodland~
   The thick, eerie woodlands slope down sharply to the east,

where the slope tilts at a sharp angle.

A Steep Dip in the Woodlands~
   High above, the pine forest stretches away beyond view. In 
this bowl below the woodland, steep rock walls offer handholds to 
any seeking to climb out. Slippery and covered with moss and 
lichen, they offer little obstacle to the creatures living in 
this wood, but more of a challenge to visitors. 
   The ground is strewn with large rocks and snapped branches, 
bones of small creatures mingling with low-growing plants.

Jutting Outcrop Amidst the Trees~
While the dark pine roof above allows little illumination,
the large vertical rock formation jutting out of the woodland
floor stands out in sharp contrast to the tree trunks and pine
needles. It is roughly oblong in shape, vertical and offering
few handholds as it pushes up through the top of the woods.
The granite is covered in many places with moss and lichen
and even clumps of short grass and the occasional sapling
struggling to survive. In all directions the pine trees
continue, except to the north where a vertical drop leads
to a bowl-shaped depression.

A Boulder Among the Pine Trees~
   Long ago this closely-packed woodland's slumber was disturbed 
by the fall of a great boulder from high above. Many years must 
have passed it seems, for the canopy is without a break and the 
great arrowhead-shaped rock is now home to bird nests and 
clinging ivy. Wood ant nests rise nearby from the pine needles, 
lending an every-present rustle to the otherwise silent resting 
place.

the woods thicken and darken. Fungus grows everywhere: clinging 
to bark, standing atop small boulders, nestling among the pine 
needles.

A Sunken Clearing of Dead Soil~
   Devoid of pine trees or any flora, a ragged circle of dark and 
stinking soil creates an unnatural clearing in the midst of the 
dark woods. Stretching across an area the size of a large barn, 
this damp, putrid-smelling pit lends at least a view of the 
mountains stretching still higher above. Snow sits at their 
peaks, clean and white during clear days in stark contrast to 
this reeking, blackened clearing.

A Sheltered Clearing Before A Birch Cabin~
   A lightly-trod path winds gently westward through the trees to 
meet a modest stone walkway made of river rock before a cozy 
birch cabin. Cradled on all sides except the east by pale, 
spindly birch trees, the cabin is small, intimate and idyllic. 
It is recently constructed of birchwood, its scent mingling with 
and intensifying the fresh, natural sent of the surrounding wood. 
The windowed eastern face is obscured by a narrow, evenly 
varnished porch leading up to a solid oak door, and the roof is 
pitched, the apex being somewhat off from the center and 
featuring the small window of an upper loft. A quaint stone 
chimney on the southern face reaches skyward. The cabin is 
surrounded on all sides by a seven-foot heavy wood fence with 
posts of oak and crossmembers of birch, with a sturdy oaken gate 
situated along the path. North of the path, abutted to the 
fence, is a small two-stalled stables, with tool pegs on the 
outside and a lean-to roof.

The Cozy Front Room Of A Birch Cabin~
   This cozy room is rather large, occupying most of the main 
floor of the cabin. The interior stain is warm and dark, and the 
hands of a skilled craftsman have laid a straight, even hardwood 
floor. A square, maple-shuttered window on the east wall can be 
opened to admit sunlight during the day, or the elaborate chatter 
of woodland creatures at night. A chimney of smooth, grey river 
rocks bound together with mortar rises up the southern wall from 
the fireplace. Across from the window, a narrow birch staircase 
leads up, past a sturdy trapdoor and into the attic loft, while a 
pale green wool curtain separates this room from the quaint 
kitchen to the north.

together to make the walls, ceiling, and support beams. This 
cozy refuge is proof against rain or snow except on the western 
wall, in which a maple-shuttered window has been set near 
eye-level. A pale, green wool curtain separates the kitchen from 
the front room to the south.

rare. The pungent scent of oozing resin hangs in the air, rents
in several of the trunks running down as if clawed.

here, reflecting off many stalacmites and pillars of wet 
crystalline rock. Thousands of years have passed within this 
cavern to form such structures, causing progress to be slow, 
awkward and slippery. While the cavern walls begin to narrow on 
each side, to the north the roof tips down out of sight over the 
edge of a slippery, smooth ridge.

smooth walls rise up out of sight beyond the reach of lantern or 
torch. More holes offer further access into the Mordor mountain 
depths on the north and west walls, each raised above the ground 
a few feet. They are quite small and offer only enough room for

   Smooth round walls surround a slippery, yet even, rock floor. 
It seems that a great rush of water once forged this place, 
swirling around before continuing on to wherever it eventually 
came out of the mountains. A small hole, barely large enough to 
crawl into, offers a way out at the base of the southern rock 
wall. Another larger hole appears near the top of this cave, 
starting just above the height of a normal person set into the 
shiny northern rock face.

   This long, large tunnel glistens the length of its gray-green 
clammy surface. Small, dank pools barely a finger length deep 
are dotted along the passageway. A hole looks out over a cave to 
the south. The other direction sees the tunnel go on into a 
Y-shaped split.

   This natural conjugation offers access south along a high and

meandering tunnels. The weight of the rock presses heavily here, 
air cold and damp and the silence broken only by the footfalls of 
travellers and the scraping of equipment against the rock.

A Rumbling Cavern Under the Mountains~
   This colossal hollow deep within the mountains stretches far 
away in all directions save southwards, where a smooth tunnel 
entrance leads off into darkness. High above, enormous 
stalactites of glistening, pointed grey rock hang down, while the 
floor of this great cavern is swallowed up within a few footfalls 
of the rim by a still, dark lake. Light shone here reflects the 
slight ripples high up the curving, overhanging cavern walls. 
   A deep and distant rumbling can be heard.

   Disappearing around a bend to the west, the southern section 
of this natural bored tunnel is smooth and damp to the touch. 
The northern end shows cracks in the rock roof, and water drips 
slowly down to form shallow pools, staining the otherwise 
blemish-free floor. The cracks are long and thin, reaching 
across the damaged section.

ancient trees, or perhaps the trees fending off the mountain. No 
further progress can be made southwards, except where a large 
hole opens up down a striated set of granite ledges forming a 
natural set of steps. The hole is bell-shaped and flanked by the 
roots of trees and moist gray-green rock shoulders.

well above the heads of most travellers. The large formations of 
glistening, damp rock offer natural passages deeper into the 
caves. Northwards the tunnel mouth leads out into the woods

   This cavern is rather large and cloying, the ceiling high

many of them seemingly drooping to a sharp and deadly point. The 
walls glisten with a silvery-green sheen coating expanding all 
the way up from the roof of the cave down to the massive 
stalagmites protruding up from the ground, their surface bulbous 
and waxy in feeling. A cramped crawlspace near the ground in the 
western wall of the cavern allows narrow passage out of the cave 
while a small alcove is hidden behind a wall of rock-protrusions 
to the south.

giving out a stench akin to that of rotting eggs. The ground is 
alive with the sound of insects and many red wood ants are 
trapped in the trees' leaking lifeblood.

A Secluded Mountain Canyon~
   A large hole leads through to a much larger pinewood beyond to 
the west. Stretching eastwards this narrow canyon is fed by 
streams pouring down from the sheer walls high above. They merge 
some way ahead and form a fast-flowing torrent that disappears 
downwards out of sight near the sheer eastern rock walls. The 
brown and red granite and limestone cliffs offer shelter here and 
seem to trap warmer air, as the pine trees are absent, in their 
place laurels, red cedars and oaks rise tall in the rich and 
fertile soil underfoot. 
   The land slips downwards gently towards the ledge where the 
river plunges. High up on the eastern rockface beyond that 
dozens of small cave entrances can be seen.

Northern Cliffs of the Canyon~
   Vibrant greenery clings to the many wet ourcroppings of red and 
brown striated limestone and granite rocks making up this sheer 
ascent. Water falls constantly, broken up by foliage in a soft 
curtain until it joins on the canyon floor with other rivulets 
and flows eastwards. The ground is constantly rising and 
falling, creating pools and cracks.

Southern Cliffs of the Canyon~
   The rust-colored striations running across the cliff-face are 
home to moss and small plants. Alpine plants flourish in the 
water-soaked rocky outcroppings. Long ago the mountain shrugged 
off huge rocks which crashed down, now dormant and home to more 
foliage and small creatures. The ground is broken up by the 
fallen rocks.

The River Plunges~
   The widest part of the canyon slopes gently towards a ledge, 
signalling the end of the way eastwards. A rumbling can be heard 
beyond as the streams combine in many places to feed a plunge of 
dozens of cave mouths high above on the cliff wall is granted. 
The way is blocked by the drop below, which spans the entire 
width of the canyon and falls into darkness below. Far beneath 
the water thunders as it reaches what must be an underground 
lake.

Northern Edge of a Plunge Below~
   Water scatters down from high above, showering the foliage 
with a cold, wet haze. The plunge eastwards stops all further 
travel while the calls of rooks sounds out in great numbers as 
they nest in the many crevices leading down from the top of the 
rockface.

Southern Edge of a Plunge Below~
   Overhanging granite high above offers little shelter to 
anything below, as rivulets of water run down from the clifftops 
and plunge below to form many recesses that link to run eastwards 
and fall over the edge of the slippery ledge. Greenery is 
prevalent and many types of wildlife and alpine flora thrive 
here.

A Freshly Built Warehouse~
   Constructed of thick logs, this sturdy warehouse is quite 
roomy. Utilitarian in design and decor, this single room 
building has plenty of open space, allowing for a variety of 
storage bins, racks and cabinets to be placed here. The 
wood-plank floor, dark and glossy, is freshly finished and 
unmarred as yet. Several lanterns have been spaced along the 
walls, providing ample light.

A Cosy Attic Loft~
   The wooden ladder built onto the ledge leads up into a room 
with a slanted roof high enough for the majority of people to 
stand upright, but slanting down to an area about half that 
height. Up the middle of the west wall extends the stack of a 
grey, river-rock chimney that provides wintertime warmth. 
Stained a golden brown, the floor is made of planks of 
light-colored birch, sanded and stained a light golden brown.

A Small Cellar~
   This small cellar is carved out of the earth, the walls and 
floor the dark-brown color of packed dirt. However, thick wooden 
beams support the ceiling and walls, providing ample space for 
one to walk around despite its low ceiling. It is rather cool 
here, its depth underground leaving it rather resistant to the 
elements.

Expansive Meeting Hall~
   White stone makes up the entirety of this very large 
rectangular building's walls. Each of the blocks has been sanded 
smooth and then fit skillfully together with mortar rising up 
well over twice the height of a man. Eight large pillars of 
white stone have been carved helping support a slightly curved 
white stone ceiling. Windows allow light to filter into the room 
from high on the wall. The floor of this spacious building is 
large enough for people to easily mill about and is made up of 
black stone which contrasts to the white of the walls. Three 
steps raise up about two-thirds of the way into the hall leaving 
an area slightly raised up. Inlaid into the black stones of the 
floor on the raised section are white stones which depict a sword 
before a seven-pointed star, the symbol of Lord Astirian.

Storage Room and Passage ~
   Smooth white stone make up the walls and ceiling of this room 
while the floor is made up of black stone. Obviously a storage 
area there is a clear path as well that leads between a staircase 
to the west and the meeting hall through the southern door. 
Shelves and crates neatly line the walls to help avoid clutter 
although there is more than enough room for the storage of 
tables, chairs or any other number of things a meeting hall might 
need.

   A beautifully crafted building of white stone is connected to 
the inn nearby. Lacking any true adornment the stonework is 
still clearly of high quality. A very short path made up of 
black stone lead the last few paces to the double doors of the 
meeting hall. Lush grass surrounds the meeting hall as well as 
the occasional tree. The White City rises up in the distance to 
the south west, its stones matching that of the Hall's.

A Road Approaching a Looming, Ancient Watchtower~
   A winding cut into the rock of the hillside opens up here onto 
a recently repaired cobble road which is just wide enough to 
accommodate a single, large wagon. Studded here and there with 
raven-etched cobblestones, the track bends northward at an old 
maple tree that provides travelers shade in the spring and 
summer. From there it runs past a weathered old wooden structure 
to the west and toward the looming presence of an ancient stone 
watchtower. Immediately to the south, the mountainside plunges 
off at the verge of the path in a sheer cliff, providing a 
breathtaking view of Anorien far below. 
   To the southwest of the stable, there are some debris and 
rocks which have come off the mountain.

A Small Stable with a Log Roof~
   Made of weathered old grey timber, this stable has clearly 
stood for scores of years in service to the Watchtower beyond. 
The dirt floors are kept sprinkled and raked, the stalls are 
clean, and the smell of fresh hay pervades the area. Over a gate 
to the west you can see a long row of stalls. 
   The exception to the aging stables is the roof above. With 
barely enough room to stand in the hayloft beneath thin oak 
beams, a layer of birch logs are lodged in place above, sealing 
out the elements and lending a scent of fresh wood shavings to 
the stables.

handful of them are prepared for use now. Grain buckets and 
water troughs rest at the entrance of each stall with a large 
grain bin at the end of the row. The aisle is kept sprinkled and 
raked and the horses well-groomed.

A Recently Cobbled Courtyard~
   The cobbled road ends in a wide courtyard at the base of an 
ancient tower. The massive stone structure looms above, 
cut-and-fitted stones now grown over by thick tendrils of 
climbing ivy with large clumps of moss lingering inside cracks 
and chinks. Where its base meets the northern edge of the 
courtyard a pair of sturdy, riveted oak doors lead inside, 
flanked by crescent-shaped plots of earth. The center of the 
courtyard is dominated by a large brazier, well-laid cobbles, 
some raven-etched, spreading from it in ever-widening circles. 
The hillside opens up to the west and, beyond a gate, a pathway 
leads through gardens toward the trees beyond.

A Patch of Gardens Around an Old Tower~
   A pathway winds through square patches of gardens that stretch 
outward from this corner of the old tower, dug with care into the 
rocky hillside. Hewn-log edging contains the rich soil of the 
garden patches to prevent it from running down the hillside as it 
steepens sharply to the south. Small herbs and flowers grow 
thickly in the beds in contrast to the rocky ground and tufts of 
tough grass that surrounds them, a few shrubs and trees 
strategically placed.

   A man-made grove is evenly planted on the level slope of this 
plateau, the surrounding mountains provide seclusion and silence 
to this place. Mountain birds twitter amongst carefully-groomed 
branches, while a cool wind blows down the mountainside. An 
ancient stone tower rises just to the northeast, jutting into the 
sky. A pathway winds through the trees in a smooth curve from 
west to north, continuing up the gentle slope northward. 
   To the south, the line of orchard trees ends as one approaches

A Quiet Orchard Climbing a Slope~
   The hillside steepens here, the man-made grove of orchard 
trees extending further to the south. As the hill climbs, the 
fruit types change, planted in even rows. A steady breeze rounds 
the mountain, constantly stirring these upper trees with its 
breath. The rows of trees eventually end, a winding pathway 
continuing on into a barren area of large stones up and to the 
west. An old tower juts into the sky beyond the trees to the 
east, just a short distance off.

A Rocky Plateau of Tombs~
   A steep path leads up to this spartan plateau, bordered on all 
sides by juts of mountain stone. The ground here is grey and 
lifeless bedrock and crumbles of crushed stone where even weeds 
fail to find purchase. A constant moaning of the wind keens 
through the tall spires that border the area, like the mountain 
itself mourns. The front of a mausoleum is built of exquisite 
construction here, aged beyond all attempts at reckoning its date 
of origin, its rear blending seamlessly with the sheer cliff of 
the mountainside. The sealed stone doors are carved with the 
tree of Gondor, surrounded by seven stars. The door is flanked 
by two massive rowan trees, possibly centuries old, the means of 
their purchase on the stone ground indiscernible. A rectangular 
stone table is centered in the middle of the flat clearing, 
centered in front of the doors and equidistant from all edges of 
the area.

A Quaint Storefront~
   The inside of this sturdy wooden outbuilding is lit by two 
tarnished wall lanterns, the entire place imbued with the 
overpowering scent of various herbs. Simple and functional, all 
the walls are lined with shelves, a long counter standing out 
from the northern stone wall, a well-worn chair behind it for the 
shopkeeper. The roof is pitched outward from the tower, making 
it tall and roomy above the counter, but sloping down to only six 
feet at the far side of the room.

   The entry hall is wide enough to fit four men abreast, from

soft glow no matter what time of day. A thick layer of soot 
blackens the wall above each lantern, the stains spreading across 
the ceiling like inky clouds, obscured only by thick cobwebs out 
of reach in the corners of each oak beam running across the 
ceiling. Thick wooden doors open off either side of the hallway 
into rooms beyond, while the hallway continues north to 
smoothly-arched wide doorway, nine-foot double-doors of ancient 
timber carved in bas relief with the white tree of Gondor 
standing sentry.

A Common Room~
   Shaped to the interior of the rounded outer wall of the tower, 
this room has a square corner at the junction of the north and 
west walls, but the southwest edge is a rounded curve, bowing 
outward with the towers curvature. The ceiling, walls, and floor 
are the same ancient grey stone, seasoned oak beams a few feet 
wide stretching across the ceiling to help support the structure 
above. A brass lantern hangs from a sturdy beam over a table 
which provides the centerpiece to the area. Tarnished brass 
lanterns surround the room, providing a steady flickering light 
to the windowless area night and day.

   A spartan barracks clearly designed by those with a mind for 
military efficiency, this room contains the bare necessities. 
Thick, aged tapestries depicting the image of a sword before a 
seven-pointed star cover the walls, faded with age, dust, and 
grime. Bunks line the long east and west walls, their structure 
sound, but dry with extreme age. The east wall bows outward with 
the curvature of the tower, while a large fireplace fills the 
northeast corner, providing warmth to this otherwise cold stone 
room.

A Vaulted Dining Room~
   This breathtaking room takes up much of the towers bottom 
floors, easily accommodating a few dozen people and extending 
upward twice as high as the other rooms. Seven columns rise up 
the walls, supporting a vaulted domed ceiling, a massive oil lamp 
chandelier on thick, black iron chains suspended in its center, 
shedding light across the entire chamber. Leaded glass panels 
surround the dome to reflect the light downward and add their own 
soft glow for impressive effect. Between the columns are seven 
alcoves for statues, though several show signs of having the 
artwork removed. Dust and spider webs occupy the upper arches 
where the pillars meet the roofwork, and upon closer inspection 
many small nicks and scars can be seen to mar the edges of the 
stone.

A Stone Stairway~
   Dark stone bearing the patina of age, this stairway is smooth 
and even, coiling upward and downward in interminable clockwise 
coils. Each step is wide enough for two men to walk abreast, 
narrower at the inside edge and wider at the outer edge, curling 
around in a spiral so only one quarter turn is visible as you 
climb. Each step is worn with a small depression at the center 
by centuries of feet passing over them. A greystone archway, its 
keystone carved with the image of a sword before a seven-pointed 
star, opens into a large chamber to the south.

Feeling along the masterfully-joined stones, you take note of a 
curious portion where the mortared join is thicker and marked by
an even hairline seam. Tracing the seam, you feel that there may be 
a concealed passage.

A Lonely Stone Chamber~
   A simple archway to the north opens onto this dank chamber, 
the hewn-stone walls crusted with nitre and slick with moisture. 
The walls are rough, cut into the natural bedrock rather than 
laid of hewn block. Three ancient, corroded, metal portculli 
open in intervals around the room, the sound of dripping heard in 
the darkness beyond. 
   There is much work being done here and scaffolds have been put 
up against the walls. Blocks of stone as well as much dirt and 
crumblings of ancient stones are scattered over the floor.

A Dark and Lonely Cell~
   Roughly circular, this room is large enough for a man to spend 
considerable time pacing. The walls are rough and damp, hewn 
into the solid bedrock of the mountainside. Sharp marks and 
broken chunks mar the walls surface, evidence of attempts to 
bludgeon or dig. Cobwebs fill the corners where the rounded 
walls meet the ceiling above, some fresh, most layered upon each 
other, decades of neglect allowing the old strands to waft on the 
moist breeze.

A Wide, Open Laboratory~
   Easily encompassing half the towers breadth, this old 
laboratory has a roomy feel to it. The room is the grey tower 
stone; the ceiling, however, is stained with strange hues, while 
the floor is marred by periodic scorchmarks. Large rectangular 
and circular spaces clear of dust mark where once equipment must 
have lain. Wide windows with thick wooden shutters line the 
curved east wall, allowing the mountain breeze to attempt to 
clear the acrid odors from the room. A small area at the south 
end is divided off by a wall of light-stained oak, a simple door 
providing access.

A Long Library (N)~
   This room forms a neatly curving hemisphere, extending halfway 
around the tower with two curved walls. The outer curvature of 
the tower wall to the west forms one side of the room, while the 
curved wall of domed ceiling below forming the inner wall. The 
outer wall is the same aged grey stone as the rest of the tower, 
monotonous in its uniformity, but is covered up to about six feet 
in height by a long row of bookshelves mounted to its surface. A 
large stone fireplace along the north wall can be lit to provide 
warmth to the long chamber. The inner wall is beautiful; the 
translucent leaded-glass panels of the dome, warped with age, 
glow with a soft light at all hours from the chandelier hung 
within the dome, giving the room a peaceful feel. A few desks 
face the dome, the soft light illuminating their work surface, 
while a larger pine work table occupies the middle of the isle.

here is harshly weathered by the elements, the floor pitted and 
chipped, chunks of stone crumbling away from the notched 
battlements. The view in each direction is breathtaking, 
allowing clear sight across the entire Anorien and Pelennor, even 
to the blue ribbon of the Anduin river in the distance. The 
White City of Minas Tirith can be clearly seen on the horizon. A 
charred slab resides near the center of the roof, while a small 
wooden structure is built in the southeast corner.

A High-Fenced Gated Paddock~
   This lush paddock is carpetted with verdant, well-grazed 
grass, which is dotted, especially around its edge, by 
wild-flowers during the spring and summer. Its boundary is 
marked by a high slatted wooden fence, built of sturdy logs of 
wood. A well trodden broad path runs alongside the fence on one 
side of the paddock, from the wide double doors in the stable, 
providing access to the lane, through double gates. To the 
north, over the fence, can be seen a farmyard, and buildings, 
while to the south, as the land of the hill begins to fall away, 
stretch the vast fertile reaches of the Pelennor fields.

There is an open area, where a couple of carts are stored, along 
with various items of harness and horse tack. Beyond this is a 
tidy line of horse stalls and, opposite these, are loose boxes 
with high wooden sides and sturdy gates. A pair of double doors 
lead to the paddock, easily wide enough to bring a substantial 
cart into the stable.

Rocky Slope Around an Ancient Tower ~
   Lying in the perpetual shadow of the tower that rises above, 
this area is relatively barren, only patches of stubborn weeds 
finding purchase in the rocky soil. A massive stone furnace 
rests on the hillside above the tower, the ground it scorched and 
blackened by intense heat. A split-rail fence separates this 
area from the garden patches visible to the southwest around the 
tower's wall, an orchard of small trees lying to the west on the 
hillside. The rocky mountainside rises up northward while the 
solid expanse of the tower wall provides an impenetrable barrier 
to the south, its old mortared stones worn with time and covered 
by clumps of moss.

A Trail Winding Up the Mountainside~
   Climbing the face of an escarpment to the north, this ancient 
trail cuts back and forth in tight turns as it rises, wagon ruts 
showing recent use. It climbs the grey stone of a peak to the 
north, scrub, grasses, and craggy trees clinging to its surface 
along the trail sides. The east falls away, looking down onto 
foothills below and then the fields of Anorien below, grasslands 
stretching out at the edge of the hills to the birchwood beyond. 
The Ramas Echor stretches like a white snake across the fields, 
towers visible on the horizon both in Anorien and the Pelennor. 
To the west lie taller foothills growing into the White 
Mountains, with Mount Mindolluin dominating the Southeast, Minas 
Tirith and its Tower of Ecthelion glistening white.

A Trail Through a Defile~
   An old trail rises up the side of wide defile, the foothills 
of Mount Mindolluin rising to either side, the mountain itself 
visible in the sky to the southeast. The trail rises steadily, 
carved wide and level into the hillside in ages past, climbing 
ever higher and ever northward until it crests out of the defile 
with a view over the hillside to the east, taller hills to the 
west and north.

An Old Trail into the Hills~
   An old trail rises up from the fields of Anorien, rising in a 
slow arc up into the foothills of Mount Mindolluin. The trail is 
hard-packed and wide, cleared and flattened so that, at one time, 
up to three or four horses might have ridden abreast on cobbles. 
The trail has succumbed to the encroachments of time with shrubs 
and erosion narrowing its breadth. The trail is now pocked by 
weeds and clumps of grass, but wide enough for a wagon to pass 
easily. The trail climbs a rise to the west, curves around a 
sheer rock face, and continues north.

Horse Market~
   A very large pen has been erected here, the fence surrounding 
it standing to the height of an average man's waist. There is no 
kind of covering, leaving the entire area exposed to the elements 
while the ground is field dirt and trodden grass. A long row of 
troughs has been pushed up against one wall of the fencing while 
at each corner of the pen, brass lanterns have been hung to shine 
light over the area even during the night. Horses of different 
breeds graze and rest here within the pen and a wide gate to the 
west leads back to the dirt path.

plain grey linen. The ceiling above is sloped and beamed with 
wood. The stone floor is lined with woolen rugs for warmth and 
comfort.

Sturdy Interior of the Compound~
   This chamber is enormous and immaculate. A fairly new wooden 
floor, with only the occasional gouge or scratch where something 
heavy has been pushed along its surface, spreads out beneath your 
feet. Along the northern wall, a stout door of solid oak has 
been placed, leading deeper into the structure, a similar door 
opposing it to the south, while somewhat narrower, less sturdy 
doors have been placed within either wall to the east and west, 
probably leading to bedrooms. The obvious recent construction 
lends to the overall sturdy structure of this cabin and is 
further confirmed by the fresh cuts still visible in the struts 
making up its ceiling.

A Large Bedroom~
   This smaller room adjoining the larger via a small door set in

compound. Spartan in decor, furnishings have been kept to a 
minimum and a large pallet composed of soft rabbit furs dominates 
the center of the oak floor. A small window in the southern wall 
allows light and fresh air in, flanked by two sturdy shutters 
that have been heavily lacquered to shield this chamber from the 
elements. Built within the heavy oak logs of the western wall, a 
modestly sized fireplace of river-rock has been constructed, 
bathing the room in cozy warmth during cooler seasons. A wide 
archway in the northern wall allows egress to a small bathing 
chamber.

Heledhnen Compound~
   At the borders of the birchwoods, a large compound is set 
overlooking the banks of the river Heledhnen. In all seasons, 
the sound of flowing water and songbirds surround this sturdy 
structure of oak logs. A short path of trodden earth lies here, 
leading to the thick wooden front door of the compound to the 
north, while branches lead east, towards a towering barn a few 
dozen yards away, or west, where it curves around the corner of 
the structure and along its side. Birch trees grow all around 
except to the north where the ground gives way a short distance 
away to the Heledhnen riverbank and shoreline.

Grassy Plains Cabin~
   Set amidst a a small, dirt-filled yard is a small cabin of 
notched logs rests here, it's exterior raw and unpainted, 
beginning to silver slightly from exposure to the elements. A 
few scraggly weeds grow around the area, left untouched save for 
a small, heavily-trod path that leads up the front door of the 
cabin, set in the northern wall. Should the winds be still, one 
might detect the subtle, musky aroma of wild game wafting from 
cabin itself.

Main Room of the Cabin~
   The spacious chamber of this cabin has been consolidated into 
a single living space, a stout door of roughly-hewn oak set into 
the southern wall and leading outside, while the door set in the 
western wall is thinner. Thick, notched logs make up the walls 
while above, the ceiling rises some fifteen feet at the center 
brace and the roof itself pitches north and south before meeting 
the respective walls. the floor is composed of sturdy oak planks 
that have not been sanded. Set into the northern wall, a 
fireplace has been constructed and no windows can be seen within 
this room. The cracks between the notched logs that make up the 
wall have been sealed with a thin bead of long dried pine-tar.

A Small Room~
   Far smaller then the main room of this cabin, this chamber 
might have been intended as a bedroom, but instead seems to be 
more of a storage space for various pelts and hides, the musky 
smell of wild animals strong here even when pelts are not 
present. A myriad of racks have been set into the northern, and 
western walls, and the southern wall bears a built in set of 
shelves. Beyond these simple, efficient furnishings, this room 
seems otherwise barren, though the floor has been covered in a 
light layer of river sand. Small notches have been cut into the 
wall for ventilation, and a simple, light-duty door has been set 
into the eastern wall, leading to the main chamber.

A Path West of the Horse Market~
   This pathway has been made of hard-packed dirt and leads past 
the fenced pasture to the east where a variety of horses can be 
seen. The area to either side of the path is a healthy green 
grass and intermittently erected along the way are sturdy wooden 
poles bearing hanging lanterns to light the area in the evening. 
The path continues northwards to where some stalls seem to have 
been erected.

wooden stalls, many items visible hanging from racks and packed 
into shelves within. To the east, a stall with tools lining the 
shelves has been erected while to the west, one can see bins of 
wool and shepherding items. To the north, more stalls stand 
while southwards, a fenced horse-yard can be seen.

A Tool Merchant's Stall~
   An off-white canvas fabric spreads out across the entirety of 
this stall, providing minimal shelter from the elements from up 
above and behind but otherwise leaving the side and front of the 
stall bare. Racks and small tables have been set up around the 
interior, displaying a number of tools for sale, some still in 
the process of being completed. To the west leads back out to 
the dirt path, the sound of horses audible nearby.

A Turn in the Path~
   The path continues here through the wooden stalls, packed dirt 
marking the way eastwards as tall posts bear suspended lanterns 
to light the area in the evening. A tall birch tree gives shade 
here between two stalls, one to the north and one to the west. 
The smell of freshly-baked goods wafts in from the northern stall 
and the scent of raw meat comes in from the west. To the south, 
the pathway leads past even more stalls though the faint sound of 
horses can be heard as well.

Green Acres Farm Stall~
   This stall is of simple but sturdy construction, open front 
and back to form a simple breezeway, though a heavy flap may be 
lowered and fastened in cold or bad weather. The walls are 
formed of simple pine wood, but are painted in a bright, cheery 
green-and-yellow, with round windows cut high in the walls to let 
in the sun. The roof is slightly sloped and covered in sod. 
Stacked in various crates and barrels and jars and shelves around 
the stall are farm goods and produce: dairy products, fresh, ripe 
vegetables, eggs, and more. The shelves seem unusually low to 
the ground.

totally open, allowing a breeze to waft inside. Shelves built

leather goods, farm produce, clothing and other items.

about this room as well. The floor is made of birch wood,

darkly-lacquered shutters open and close, bestowing light into 
the relaxing room during the daytime and the walls are made up of 
grey stone, keeping the area cool in the summer and warm in the 
winter. The floor is made of birch wood, the planks sanded, free 
of splinters, and with few imperfections. A small stone 
fireplace lights and warms the room when it is lit. A birch wood 
door has been placed to the south and west of the room, the

A Musty Rookery~
   Sheltered from the elements by fresh-hewn birch timbers 
constructed above, this rookery is musty with the smells of 
feathers and droppings. Shelves hold nests where the large black 
birds nest while perches abound for them to roost. Openings to 
the north allow the birds egress into the open air beyond, while 
a large tray holds their feed. A small trapdoor in the corner of 
the shelter away from the raven perches allows access down into 
the building, a wooden pole bearing a hanging brass lantern 
casting light over the rookery even in the evening.

Rocky Crop Cabin~
   A small worn path snakes through tall grasses and barely 
maintained, wildy growing shrubs to the front of a small cabin. 
Made of a variety of crudely cut and stacked logs, this 
dilapidated cabin still appears quite sturdy even with its worn 
woven roof. Several small gaps have been covered with jagged, 
curved pieces of wood from broken shields, or stiff over tanned 
hides. Facing the door one can see a pair of uneven shutters 
made from a patchwork of boards held together with rusting nails.

   This room seems far more maintained then one would expect from 
the outside or the adjoining room. The bark of the logs making 
up the walls has been scrapped away so the wood can be planed, 
sanded smooth, and had a dark stain applied to it. A wooden 
chest has been securely bolted into the floor and against the 
eastern wall beside a bed. At first appearance it would appear 
there are no windows or ventilation in this room, when looking 
over the various hides adorning the wall though, you can see that 
set against the southern wall is a small gap that can be peered 
through if you pull aside the stiff hide covering it from the 
inside and outside as well.

fence to the west, allowing one access back to the path while 
large posts bearing lanterns that burn in the evening rise up 
from intermittent spaces upon the fencing, lighting the area in 
the nighttime. 
   To the east, a small dirt path leads into the fields and 
grasslands of the Pelennor fields.

A Burnt Down Windmill~
   Light filters in through the cracks in the blackened roof of 
this old windmill. The rafters above are in poor condition, some 
hanging from what seems impossibly tiny nails. The one familiar 
feature is that the entire room is blackened, with the entire 
southern wall collapsed. A few supports manage to hold up the 
roof, though it sags dangerously. The rest of the walls are a 
mess. Gaps traverse the their entire length, slats where light 
pours in. On the ground, dirt has caked into a thick, crusted 
vat of mud. The remains of what seem to have been the main 
spindle is a blackened stone husk. A burnt door, having 
relatively escaped ruin, is set in the northern wall.

Dim light makes its way into this old, burnt mill from the gaps in
the roof and the walls. The entire area is silent, eerily so, the
blackened husk of what was once a windmill now devoid of nearly all
traces of its previous function. A single burnt spindle remains in
the center of the room. The southern wall is completely collapsed,
the sound of a river audible in the distance. Only a few supports
remain to hold up the sagging roof. A burnt door, relatively spared
from ruin, waits to the north.

   The collapsed wall leads out into a small patch of dirt and 
grass before the wide, flowing Anduin. Little moves here save 
the occasional cricket. A few stones lie on the grass by the 
river, their surfaces smooth and flat. An old willow tree hangs 
out over the river, providing shade during the daytime to the 
stones, which seem to be in a position of constant shadow no 
matter the time.

here, the blackened shell looming. The yard and general area is 
filled with rocks and debris, charred pieces of wood scattered 
about and falling from the walls yet still. The only sound 
audible is the nearby river, the cold waters rushing close by 
though the place is otherwise silent and eerie. A door to the 
south still stands, relatively spared from the ruin.

Mountain Trail Leading Up Toward a Tall Keep~
   Beginning in the Pelennor Fields, east of the slopes of Mount 
Mindolluin, this wide trail heads westwards in a slight curve 
towards the mountain's feet. Hills and tall grass give way to 
rocks and shrubs as it moves closer to the mountainside in a 
moderate incline. The road is well-kept and well-sheltered from 
the elements, with sheer cliffs rising to the west and south. It 
comes to a halt in front of a tall, stone keep which is built on 
a rise of land high above the Pelennor Fields, granting it a 
great view of the lands to the east.

crenellation of rocks behind the mausoleum that stands to the 
east. A heavy, wrought-iron fence surrounds this area, many 
worn, stone gravestones marking patches of dirt here and there. 
The constant moaning of the winds can be heard, lending the small 
burial site an eerie atmosphere.

Frog Cottage~
   Nestled between tall grasses, a small, cozy stone-walled cabin 
sits. The walls are choked with threads of ivy vines that 
consume much of the outer parts, while the glass of windows can 
be barely seen inbetween their covering in some areas. A chimney 
extrudes from the rooftop, often puffing a plume of grey smoke. 
A wooden door set to the north leads to the inside of the cabin.

A Yard Before A Stone Building~
   A path of blackened, flat stones leads up to a violet-painted 
front door to a large, scorched building built of grey stones. A 
tall stone wall leads around the property, marking its 
boundaries. This area has fallen in to disrepair; weeds, vines 
and other undesired vegetation has consumed it and flourished 
from within the potent soil. The thick foliage prevents easy 
movement without a cutting implement, grown thick and high.

Within Fenced-In Fields, Near a Barn~
   Gently rolling fields spread in all directions here, bordered 
to the north, east and south by a tall line of wooden fence. In 
the distance to the northwest a low hillock is visible lifting 
gently above the horizon, a small stone manor house standing at 
its peak. A barn has been built on the eastern fringes of the 
property, its timbers somewhat worn and roughened with age, a 
yard of packed dirt surrounding it. Beyond the fenced exterior 
of this stretch of land the fields of the fiefdom of Anorien 
continue, spotted with sparse vegetation and the occasional 
distant structure.

On A Sharply-Climbing Trail~
   The trail becomes less distinct here as it threads its way 
among boulders and across rock falls. Downhill, past a stand of 
scrub pine, it leads to a steep roofed hall while, for those who 
would risk the abrupt climb from this point, it stretches upward 
toward the top of a sheer bluff overlooking the region. Near at 
hand, a low cave mouth can be spotted, though its aperture is all 
but choked by wind-wracked bracken. 
   Light shining from fires further west perpetually casts the 
area in a dim light.

Inside A Dark Grotto~
   The low ceiling of this dark grotto forces all but the 
shortest of those who enter to bend double. Uneven walls, 
branching shafts, and side tunnels too small to admit passage 
leave much of this low chamber in perpetual shadow. Strange, 
lumpy rock formations with a disturbingly familiar look to them 
press in from all sides. A particularly dark boulder with a 
queer, slick look to it squats at the far side of the cave; 
asymmetrical lumps suggesting a lolling head and pendulous 
breasts.

Atop A Steep Bluff~
   Marked is the contrast between this sloping high meadow and 
the stony, bracken-draped hills and cliffs round about it. Here, 
grass grows to the height of a man's calf and small, flowers with 
fleshy, white petals thrive for much of the year. The vault of 
the sky seems within easy reach above and the wind stirs 
ceaselessly here, bringing the hint of scents from many leagues 
distant. In season, swallows dive and swoop here, riding the 
updrafts from the cliff face below. From the brink of the cliff 
that forms the meadow's southern face, a steep-roofed timber hall 
can be plainly seen, smoke trickling from the square opening amid 
its cedar shakes. Further down the slope sprawls the brown span 
of a wide yard and encircling palisade, guarded by a simple gate.

On A Steep Trail Before A Timber Hall~
   Twice the stony trail switches back upon itself as it climbs 
this rugged hillside. At the head of the path stands a broad 
hall of weathered timber. The battered and failing roof of the 
structure dips almost to the ground on either side, covered with 
countless shakes of split cedar. High above, at the ridgeline, 
the topmost timbers have been fitted with finials shaped in the 
likeness of rearing serpents, festooned with folded wings. The 
single doorway set in the face of the hall is both low and 
narrow, forcing taller folk to stoop as they enter. Facing the 
door, the trail continues up the cliff face to the right hand, 
while a cave mouth yawns to the left.

Within A Dry Cave~
   The rough floor of this dry cave slopes evenly toward the 
entrance and regular ripples in the dull stone underfoot suggest 
the slow work of some ancient watercourse. The ceiling above, 
while easily brushed with an upraised arm, is tall enough to 
accommodate a standing adult for all but the rear-most quarter of 
the cave's area. Numerous pine saplings have been cut and lashed 
with sturdy cords to form a simple framework. This framework has 
been overlaid with heaped pine boughs to make a crude layer of 
knee-deep matting which serves to keep anything stored here well 
above any seasonal damps.

Within a Steep, Roofed Hall~
   This rough-hewn timber hall has been built directly into the 
rocky hillside, its rear-most wall actually formed by the stone 
of the cliff face itself. Twin rows of pillars, hewn from 
mountain pines, support the steep-pitched roof above; their 
surfaces carved with the dancing, intertwining forms of animals 
and mythical beasts. The hall has no chimney, but rather a 
square smoke hole has been cut in the distant, soot-blackened 
ceiling at the ridgeline directly above a stone-lined firepit. 
Occasionally strange, furtive moments can be made out amid the 
dark rafters high overhead. Raised platforms of rammed earth, 
faced with planks and draped with bundles of furs, line the walls 
on either hand as one enters, serving in both feasting and 
repose. A hide curtain screens off the rear portion of the hall, 
where the timber construction gives way to the walls of a low 
cave. 
   The air here is smoky and thick with the scents of animals, 
cooking, and unwashed bodies. Men, women, and children of the 
tribe linger in this place at all hours, resting, preparing food, 
and telling tales.

A Cave Forming the Rearmost Portion of the Hall~
   Here the broad timbers of wall and roof slope abruptly into 
the sheer face of the hillside, enclosing the mouth of this low 
cave. Perhaps six long paces wide and as many deep, the floor of 
this chamber is rough and, though it has been swept free of loose 
pebbles, strange greasy stains blot its surface. The stone 
overhead has been blackened by a staggeringly thick layer of 
soot, suggesting that this place was inhabited for long ages 
before the wooden hall was built to embrace it. In several 
places, the rock walls have been incised with simple images or 
marked with blotches of old pigment: here a man pursues a flock 
of shaggy goats, spear raised; there a geometric shape spirals 
endlessly in upon itself.

A Broad Yard Within A Palisade~
   A low palisade of sharpened logs surrounds this wide yard, 
stretching to join the sloping arms of the hillside on either 
hand. The crude barrier is pierced by a gate to the south. Much 
of the thin turf here has been worn away, particularly in a braod 
ring around the large, upright stone at the center of the yard, 
suggesting that countless feet have circled it. To the north, 
opposite the gate, a trail begins to climb toward a steep-roofed 
hall that looks down upon this yard from the cliff face above.

   Here a low wall of sharpened logs, only a bit higher than a 
tall mans upraised arm, stretches east to west for the distance 
of a fair bowshot where it joins the sharply descending arms of 
the rocky northern hillside. Not great defensive work, rather 
this wall seems best suited for the protection of livestock 
against predators. A single simple gate, reinforced with crossed 
timbers, pierces the wall.

more boulders and rocks dotting the area. There is a slight 
upwards incline to the trail as it continues further north before 
far in the distance, one can see the steep pathway upwards 
towards a flattened area of the mountain. The trail though 
becomes more distinct as it curves around the sheer cliffside of 
the mountain eastwards, a keening moan heard as the winds blow 
past this side of the cliff.

Up an Ancient Trail~
   As this ancient trail winds down the side of the mountain, the

by drowns out almost all sound but the keening moan of the winds 
passing through the area further down the trail, eerie and somber 
in its wail. Looking over the edge of the steep trail, one can 
see just into a dark-watered lake, the white, frothy foam and 
cool mist able to be felt upon one's features from the nearby 
waterfall. Upwards, the trail continues along the mountainside.

to support the roof any longer. These rafters have spawled out

Entering A Dark, Musty Dungeon~
   This narrow hallway is a lot colder than the rest of the 
building , the walls made of stained-darkened stone. The air 
under here is murky and far from fresh. The floor underfoot 
holds it own thick layer of dust, undistrubed and constant. 
Under it, a dried trail leads up in to the main room, following 
it are hand-sized prints up the wall, though they too have been 
partial hidden by years of dust. Several sharp notches and cuts 
mar the wall of this part of the hallway, along with a 
overwhelming smell of rot and decay, it drifts through the entire 
dungeon but is strongest here. Rusted iron bars make up one wall 
of this wall, once providing holdings for several bodies.

Upon a Narrow Trail~
   Dirt and pebbles cover the mountain rock that forms this 
cliff-side path, still narrow as it climbs steadily upwards and 
westwards along the side. Over the edge of the trail is a steep 
slide over sharp, dark-grey rocks down into the woods below where 
one can see the the tree-tops and over the foliage, the raging 
waterfall can be seen, rushing down into the lake below, the soft 
white mist of water droplets creeping fingers over the edge of 
the trees. The only passage is west where the trail continues 
or south, where it leads back down the mountain.

dust filling them. The trail is only wide enough for two to walk 
shoulder to shoulder and continues upwards at a steep incline.

massive trunks of broad-leafed trees blocking out most of the

Though the air is still, the trickling sound of a small creek 
punctuates the atmosphere. The forest lies in every direction,

A Forest Edge Beneath the Shadow of the Mountain~
   Beyond the shadow of the rock face, pines mix with hardwoods, 
some attaining considerable height. The air here is perpetually 
cool and somewhat damp, and mists often linger in the treetops. 
The hammering staccato of foraging woodpeckers often disturbs 
this otherwise quiet stretch of forest. The air here is thick 
with a silver mist that rolls in eerily from the waterfall that 
can be seen just beyond the edge of the forest to the west, its 
roar an ever-present buzz.

A Vegetation-Lined Dirt Path~
   The roots of enormous, ancient trees sprout from the ground in 
gnarls and creeping, thick fingers of wood that seek to hinder a 
traveller's passage as one walks along the half-hidden path 
through the tangle of trees. Weeds and grasses grow to either 
side of the long-ago, man-made trail, even a few stones lining 
the edges as if purposely placed, though now covered in moss and 
layers of dirt. To either side, the woods continue thickly, only 
a little of sunlight, even in the daytime, shining through the 
thick canopy above. 
   North and south the trail continues through a 
partially-cleared section of trees but in the northern distance, 
one can see a small clearing through the tree-trunks.

Approaching the Mountainside Beneath a Canopy of Trees~
   High overhead, the canopy clothes the greater vault of the sky 
with reaching arms, filtering sunlight and starlight into angular 
swaths, each it's own fragment of a shattered firmament. Below 
this stately procession of pine, elm, and ash, few saplings dare 
stand to rival their elders. The forest floor is clear here, 
save for the occasional fallen limb or loose stone, a deep bed of 
dry needles and withered leaves whispering steadily underfoot at 
any rumor of passage. Though their movements are furtive, the 
flitting progress of nuthatches or occasional twitches of 
squirrels tails are easy to spy among the uncluttered trunks of 
the wood.

East of an Ancient Mountain Trail~
   A ridgeline, perhaps the last diminished remnant of some 
grander mountain-spur, makes passage here difficult for all but 
the most sure-footed. The ash and oak farther down the slopes 
yield to pine along the ridge's uneven spine. A few narrow game 
trails weave and slant between laurel and bracken, wending their 
way toward gaps and breaks in the high ground above. Here and 
there, bare stone thrusts from the earth between clinging roots. 
Deadfall is plentiful here, dislodged rocks of all sizes 
collecting uphill of the fallen trees. 
   To the west, the trees begin to thin and one can see a 
boulder-blocked covered, dirt trail, lined by small rocks and 
debris.

East of a Dirt Path~
   The trees begin to thin slightly here, enough so that through 
the spaces between the thick branches above, one can see the grey 
sheet of rock of the mountain, rising higher than even the 
tallest tree. Still though, small bushes and tall grasses cover 
the forest floor, hiding the occasional fallen mountain debris 
that seek to trip the unwary. Westwards, a half-hidden narrow 
trail can be picked out amongst the trees, covered in vegetation.

The Trail Straightens Northwards~
   The thin trees form a haven above and to the sides of this 
thin, curling pathway while the leaves create an aura of 
yellow-red all around, fashioning a hazy tunnel ahead. There is 
little obstruction upon the forest floor save the twigs and nuts 
from the branches and wheat-colored grasses grow sporadically, 
smaller and shorter, larger and taller in random bursts. One can 
either continue along the narrow passage or turn around back into 
the forest.

Nearing the Mountainside~
   Beyond the shadow of the rock face, pines mix with hardwoods, 
some attaining considerable height. The air here is perpetually 
cool and somewhat damp and mists often linger in the treetops 
while the hammering staccato of foraging woodpeckers often 
disturbs this otherwise quiet stretch of forest. 
   Westwards through the thinning trees, a dirt trail through the 
woods can be spotted, lined with grey stones.

A Bend East and South~
   Slow curves and arcs describe the course of an old trail that 
rambles through this stretch of woodlands, though whether its 
margins have been trod into the landscape by men, passing on some 
long ago errand, or by generations of deer and other animals, 
seeking pasture and water, cannot easily be guessed. In any 
case, its head springs from among the tangles of fallen logs and 
hearty briers amid a bit of low, marshy ground where some spring 
must once have flowed, and perhaps still makes its way unseen 
along a hidden way beneath the earth's surface. Clothed on 
either hand by undergrowth of considerable density and variety, 
the trail progresses past elm, ash, and walnut to arrive amid 
more clear ground within a belt of beech trees, where it forks, 
then forks again before fading entirely as it bends eastwards.

West of a Trail Bend~
   The sovereign rulers here are giant, elder trees. Strong, old 
roots crawl like fat snakes over the earth while the colossal 
branches give a smothering shadow to everything below, allowing 
only dappled light to break through their leaves and limbs. Even 
that is meager in amount. The lofty trunks are drenched with 
moss, and between them grow dark-hued mushrooms, fat and thick. 
There is a staleness that can be found in the depths of an old 
forest that lingers in the air and eastwards past thick tree 
trunks, a trail bend can be faintly seen.

A Gently Rolling Valley Floor~
   Here the valley floor rises and falls in gentle rolls, thick 
with herb, grass, and flower. The turf underfoot is deep and 
inviting, giving rise to all manner of flora. The valley 
continues eastward where a narrow trail can be spotted, to the 
edge of sight, while steep bluffs rise to both north and south. 
Facing uphill, to the north, the breeze is at times sweetened 
above the scents of pine and moss by hints of turf and loam, 
suggesting unseen meadows somewhere in the distance.

South of a Bend in the Trail~
   As if to bar the way ahead, a large, fallen tree blocks the 
path, its roots a complex sculpture shaped by the tunnels dug by 
the insects that had nestled within them. The healthy grass 
flows undaunted around it, yet another tribute to its age. While 
the titanic tree is long dead, things around it continue to 
thrive, investing its grave and leeching off of it. Mushrooms 
cluster in huddled groups onto its side while moss grows where 
the sun might not shine so strongly. One could easily clamber 
over the tree itself and continue along the passage north or 
south.

The Depths of the Forest, East of a Trail~
   Moss festers on the rough bark of the trees, almost no 
sunlight able to break through the shield of the tree canopy 
above, the massive network of old branches twined and laced 
together. There is a perpetual dampness to everything underfoot 
and mushrooms thrive in the environment. Ivy hangs in curtains 
from above, making it hard to see what lays ahead for a 
certainty, as much of it had come to form one tangled mesh over 
time, mirroring the behemoths that they dangle from.

Passing Through the Forest~
   The foliage is prominent here. Broken off tree limbs, worn 
from age, are scattered across the ground, hindering travel and 
cracking when stepped upon. Fallen leaves are everywhere, some 
already decaying and giving off a scent of musk as they mingle 
with the damp soil. The trees creak in soft groan of limb 
whenever a strong wind passes through the area, shadows 
fluttering with the shift of the canopy.

Many brightly-colored ribbons have been tied onto various

A Walled, Stone-Floored Marshal Yard~
   Large, square, grey-white stones cover the floor of this 
tree-lined Marshal Yard. From the front, one can see the 
crenelations atop the main building to the north, occasionally 
showing movement from the soldiers on duty. The yard is square 
in shape and lined by a high wall to the south and east, which 
eventually encompasses the entire grounds forming the outer 
defences, and also preventing intruders from wandering freely and 
unchecked about the grounds. 
   A short, wide path leads the way to the steps of the entrance 
of the main building to the north, whilst a trail disappears 
westwards, following the wall. Eastwards lies the gate that 
links the bastion to the Lond Forodren-Annui.

Anything kept down here is chilly, including people who stay here 
too long. Light is provided by a single copper lantern hanging 
from a chain in the ceiling, and the floor is swept clean.

A Barn and Stable~
   This simple wooden barn has a dirt floor covered in straw,
and fairly clean wooden walls. There is a horse stall in one end
of the barn, with a tackroom, but the rest of the barn is made
up of supply areas and farm animal housing. Low windows let in
plenty of light during the day, and a very safe lantern in a
sconce allows for vision at night.
   A pair of double doors stand to the west.

A Dirt Path Crammed Between Stalls~
   The dirt-packed pathway continues through a row of open-air 
wooden stalls, many items visible hanging from racks and packed 
into shelves within. To the east, an empty stall has been 
erected to the west, while to the east, a farmer's stall stands. 
To the north, more stalls stand while southwards, the dirt path 
continues. Northwards, a gate in the fence opens into the field 
behind the row of stalls on the eastern side of the path. 
   Hanging from the stall to the west is a deep green banner 
painted with a single Tengwar symbol.

   The trees begin to thin slightly here, enough so that through 
the spaces between the thick branches above, one can see the grey 
sheet of rock of the mountain, rising higher than even the 
tallest tree. Still though, small bushes and tall grasses cover 
the forest floor, hiding the occasional fallen mountain debris 
that seek to trip the unwary.

Within the Forest~
   The trees have no limits or restrictions; no malady of man or 
disease while the verdure is wet and dense. Colossal cycads 
brace themselves between the large pines and the other trees The 
forest is unwelcoming and unkind to anything that dares tread 
here, the branches unyielding and taunt and the plants upon the 
murky ground thick and barring. The thick canopy above shadows 
all here, and only wispy tendrils of light dare seek to filter in 
from above. 
   To the west through a thick tangle of trees, the faint outline 
of a forest trail can be seen.

Deep Within the Forest~
   A fold in the floor of the wood creates a sheltered dell, 
screened by tress but more open within. High overhead, the 
canopy clothes the greater vault of the sky with reaching arms, 
filtering sunlight and starlight into angular swaths, each its 
own fragment of a shattered firmament. Below this stately 
procession of pine, elm, and ash, few saplings dare stand to 
rival their elders. The forest floor is clear here, save for the 
occasional fallen limb or loose stone, a deep bed of dry needles 
and withered leaves whispering steadily underfoot at any rumor of 
passage. 
   The trees thicken deeply in one area here, the shrubs and 
foliage providing a difficult passage.

Within A Lush Forest~
   Ferns begin to make a presence here. Ranging from bright 
green to more dark and mellow shades, the smaller they are the 
more pure the hues that they possess. The ancient trees around 
them stretch tall and regal, with the lowest branches being 
almost fifteen feet off of the ground. Thin ivy-like vines make 
themselves evident, heavily tainted with small flowers, curling 
around the patterns belonging to the thick bark of the trees, 
while the roots of the giants themselves are moist and soft.

Passing By A Labyrinth of Ferns~
   Its within the shade that fern plants come to thrive, giant, 
small, old and tall. But they are not alone. Ivy has crept over 
many of the larger ones, embracing them with their suffocating 
hug. Miniscule, yellow-white flowers bud and glisten profusely 
from the vines that laps greedily at the plants, while curling 
fern limbs coil out from underneath, reaching into the air in 
some desperate hope of escape from that which hold it. There is 
little grass growing in-between the trees, the spaces mostly 
claimed by the plants and their jailors, permitting little space 
to move.

A Slight Incline Upon the Forest Ground~
   Looking downhill, south between the ash and pine, holly trees 
have found purchase nearby, a broad grove of them permitting 
little in the way of undergrowth, and small birds stir 
ceaselessly amid the spiny, dry leaves underfoot. Facing uphill, 
to the north, the breeze is at times sweetened above the scents 
of pine and moss by hints of turf and loam, suggesting unseen 
meadows somewhere in the distance.

At the Bottom of a Decline~
   The sudden downhill stops rather sharply, pausing by a 
proverbial hedge of tangled trees and thorny bushes. The grass 
is completely flat here; little of it as there may be, squashed 
and trampled by the passage of some manner of beast. Young 
saplings have been annihilated, broken and shattered, littered 
all over and about the dust and dirt. Mud puddles lurk in more 
than one place, spurting out bubbles from time to time. No 
animals venture here and there's little sign of life other than 
the thorny bushes and gnarled trees.

A Downhill Slant of the Forest Floor~
   The ground to the south becomes slanted downhill in a sudden
dip. Without much warning it droops rapidly. Even the trees 
themselves stand less sturdy and slightly skew, as if they have
been taken by surprise. Clumps of withered grass grow in uneasy
arrangements, much of it broken and scattered, flattened and 
shattered. Replacing the general flora of mushrooms and healthy
ferns, scraggly little bushes begin to show themselves instead,
the leaves a sickly greenish-grey color. The forest stands
undeterred in other directions. 
   A large boulder stands here in the middle of the forest 
ground, moss covering its surface.

and berms of foliage. Mice and other small creatures thrive in

   The dominating presence of closely-knitted trees begins to 
wane slightly here, allowing for a bit more space to move around 
in the area. The broad trunks of the surrounding wood give way 
here to a small stand of lesser trees, with cherry, hawthorn, and 
wild mulberry among them. Mist consumes the forest, lending 
everything an ghostly argentine glimmer. The trees begin to 
straighten somewhat here, no longer possessing the gnarled, 
twisted quality of its brown-hued predecessors in the other parts 
of the forest, as a natural trail winds its way north and west 
here.

   The trail continues in a straight shot here east and west

shapes between the darkness that comes from the trees, it is 
quite clear that various forest animals often dart around. A 
prelude to the sight of them is the sound of their scuttle over 
roots and leaves, as well as the traces of their marks upon the 
barks and the undergrowth.

   Shadows draw over this part of the forest, the canopy and 
massive trunks of broad-leafed trees blocking out most of the 
sun. Filtered light does descend to the forest floor, touching 
on the wildflowers and brush eeking out a modest life there. 
Though the air is still, the trickling sound of a small creek 
punctuates the atmosphere. 
   The forest lies in every direction, continuing ever onward 
though a distinct natural trail through the forest continues east 
and south.

forest towards the opposite mountainside as a thick tangle of 
trees grows along either side of this trail.

   There is an abundance of wildlife that often scurries through

closely-knitted trees begins to wane slightly here, a bit more 
space to move around in the area. The lofty trunks are drenched 
with moss, and by them grow dark-hued mushrooms, fat and thick. 
There is a staleness that can be found only in the depths of an 
old forest that lingers in the air and the argent-white mist 
rolls in from the west, covering all in a haze.

A Thick Forest Against the Moutainside~
   There is a perpetual dampness to everything underfoot, and 
mushrooms thrive in the environment. Ivy hangs in curtains from 
above, and much of it has come to form one tangled mesh over 
time. The entanglement of ivy mirrors the behemoths that it 
dangles from, the collective mess of the winding tendrils and 
leaves making it difficult to see what lies ahead for a 
certainty. Scraggly bushes begin to show here, replacing the 
general fauna of mushrooms and healthy ferns.

Amid A Mature Forest~
   The barks of the trees here are a subdued, off tone of white, 
proclaiming partnership with the paleness of the mist, yet in 
outright battle and urge for dominance the piercing green of tall 
grass contests with the more subtle tints around it, bright and 
thick with health and vigor. Petals are whisked by the wind and 
carried over the grass, churned into small circles in the air. 
Its within the shade that fern plants come to thrive, giant, 
small, old and tall.

fallen limb or loose stone, a deep bed of dry needles and 
withered leaves whispering steadily underfoot at any rumor of 
passage. This stretch of forest curves against the valley wall 
of the mountain.

At the Outer Edge of the Forest~
   Deadfall is plentiful here, dislodged rocks of all sizes 
collecting uphill of the fallen trees. A ridgeline, perhaps the 
last diminished remnant of some grander mountain-spur, makes 
passage here difficult for all but the most sure-footed. In 
spring and early summer, the climber is rewarded with an 
unexpected burst of color as low, fleshy, broad-leafed plants 
here explode with brilliant, foam-white flowers. Ferns thrive 
underfoot year-round, but offer little purchase to those who make 
for the ridgeline above.

At the Outskirts of the Forest by A Cliffside~
   There is little grass growing in-between the trees, the spaces 
mostly claimed by the plants and their jailors, permitting little 
space to move. A massive spur of rock rises amid the woodlands 
here, casting the forest floor into shadow for much of the day. 
Mist consumes the forest, lending everything an ghostly argentite 
glimmer. The trees begin to straighten somewhat here, no longer 
possessing the gnarled, twisted quality of its brown-hued 
predecessors in the other parts of the forest.

Upon the Outskirt of the Forest~
   The trees begin to thin slightly here, enough so that through 
the spaces between the thick branches above, one can see the grey 
sheet of rock of the mountain that rises higher than even the 
tallest tree to the north and east, engulfing this small, valley 
forest in stone. Still though, small bushes and tall grasses 
cover the forest floor, hiding the occasional fallen mountain 
debris that seek to trip the unwary. 
   Westwards, the cool waters of the lake rush past and the 
roaring of the nearby waterfall fills one's ears as silvery grey 
mist rolls through the trees.

Upon the Bank of the Lake~
   Often audible, the harsh and high pitched whine of insects 
intermingles with the birdsongs. Cobwebs oscillate the 
reflection of light from their moist strings, spanning from trunk 
to trunk in silvery-grey weave, little droplets of moisture 
clining to their weave. The argent white mist rolls through the 
trees as the icy waters of the lake beyond the western bank roars 
by. The trees creak in soft groan of limb whenever a strong wind 
passes through the area, shadows fluttering with the shift of the 
canopy.

South of the Trail Into the Forest~
   The air is almost always damp here, as silvery-grey mist rolls 
perpetually into the forest from the westward lake beyond the 
riverbank that covers all with droplets of cool, icy water. The 
sovereign rulers here are elder trees, their strong, old roots 
crawling like fat snakes over the earth. The colossal branches 
cast a smothering shadow over everything below, allowing only a 
meager amount of dappled light to break through their leaves and 
limbs. The lofty trunks are drenched with moss, and dark-hued 
mushrooms grow nearby, fat and thick.

Approaching the Outskirts of the Mist-Covered Forest~
   Broken off tree limbs, weathered from age lay upon the ground, 
hindering travel and cracking when stepped upon. Fallen leaves 
are scattered everywhere, some already decaying and giving off a 
scent of musk as it mingles with the damp soil. The trees creak 
in soft groan of limb whenever a strong wind passes through the 
area, shadows fluttering with the shift of the canopy. Leaves 
are strewn heavily here. Most of them are rotting and decaying 
into the soil, though the top layer would appear to be mostly 
fresh. It emits a soft, pungent odour, that of the forest.

South of A Trail In the Forest~
   Brilliant in greens and golds, the interlacing leaves and 
branches here are enormous, spanning over thrice the size of a 
normal tree. Upon closer observation, it can be seen that nearly 
everything else in the valley itself seems to share this quality 
as well. Moss festers on the rough bark of the trees, the color 
distorting and hiding the smooth wood beneath. Almost no 
sunlight is able to break through the massive network of old 
branches that have twined and laced together to form a large 
canopy overhead. There is a perpetual dampness to everything 
underfoot, and mushrooms thrive in the environment.

Nearing the Outskirts of the Forest Upon the Trail~
   The trees creak in soft groan of limb whenever a strong wind 
passes through the area, shadows fluttering with the shift of the 
canopy. Slow curves and arcs describe the course of an old trail 
that rambles through this stretch of woodlands, though whether 
its margins have been trod into the landscape by men, passing on 
some long ago errand, or by generations of deer and other 
animals, seeking pasture and water, cannot easily be guessed.

A Straight Path Beneath A Thick Canopy~
   The path continues in a straight course east and west through 
the forest, the branches of the regal trees curving overhead in a 
majestic canopy, like thick fingers intertwining together as the 
silver mist rolls in from the west. Dried leaves and scraggly 
weaves dot along the path, the dirt soft underfoot and ever damp. 
The trail progresses past elm, ash, and walnut to arrive amid 
more clear ground within a belt of beech trees, where it forks, 
then forks again before continuing eastwards deeper into the 
forest.

A Narrow Trail Into the Forest~
   The thick copse of trees fades thinly here and thickens 
immensely eastwards further into the forest. Here, an ancient, 
narrow trail leads in through natural clearings, lined by smooth 
grey stones upon which moss grows abundantly. The path itself is 
of dirt, a few scraggly weeds growing here and there. The forest 
itself is quiet but for the echoes of birds and woodland 
creatures, only the roar of the nearby waterfall thundering over 
the buzz.

North of A Narrow Trail Upon the Outskirts of the Forest~
   As the trees of the dense forest open up all around this 
meadow, the sounds of a running river can be heard. Game trails 
dart out of the eaves of the forest, making their way around 
sparse rock formations, tucking in and out of the lush grassland 
on the river banks. Near the river's edge, the yellowed grasses 
grow taller and they blend with proud clumps of reeds and cat 
tails. 
   North and east, the forest gradually marches up the side of a 
mild hill reaching ever towards the snow capped mountains beyond. 
The meadow lies to the north and south, bounded to the west by a 
river, rolling grey mists seeping low upon the ground everywhere 
as it arises from the churning waters of the nearby waterfall. 
   A quaint cabin and leanto barn sit in a small clearing.

North of a Dirt Path Through the Forest~
   Ivy hangs in curtains from above, making it hard to see what 
lays ahead for a certainty, as much of it had come to form one 
tangled mesh over time, mirroring the behemoths that they dangle 
from. Ferns begin to make a presence here. Ranging from bright 
green to more dark and mellow shades, the smaller they are the 
more pure the hues that they possess. The ancient trees around 
them stretch tall and regal, with the lowest branches being 
almost fifteen feet off of the ground. 
   Southwards through the tangle of trees, a path through the 
forest can barely be seen, lined with grey stones.

   Small bushes and tall grasses cover the forest floor, hiding 
the occasional fallen mountain debris that seek to trip the 
unwary. Westwards, a half-hidden narrow trail can be picked out 
amongst the trees, covered in vegetation. Dejected conifers grow 
to either side of the massive rockwork, and a few scrub pines 
grow from cracks in the formation. Thick drifts of discarded 
pine needles and rotted leaves fill the area beneath the stand of 
boulders and a light earthy smell fills the air as the 
silvery-grey mists roll in from the west.

   Its within the shade that fern plants come to thrive, giant, 
small, old and tall. But they are not alone. Ivy has crept over 
many of the larger ones, embracing them with their suffocating 
hug. Miniscule, yellow-white flowers bud and glisten profusely 
from the vines that laps greedily at the plants, while curling 
fern limbs coil out from underneath, reaching into the air in 
some desperate hope of escape from that which hold it. There is 
little grass growing in-between the trees, the spaces mostly 
claimed by the plants and their jailors, permitting little space 
to move.

   The lofty trunks are drenched with moss, and between them grow 
dark-hued mushrooms, fat and thick. While its difficult to 
distinguish shapes between the darkness that comes from the 
trees, it is quite clear that various forest animals often dart 
around, a prelude to the sight of them being the sound of their 
scuttle over roots and leaves as well as the traces of their 
marks upon the barks and the undergrowth. A myriad of flowers 
poke out from the rich soil, some crushed or trod upon, while 
others stand in likeness of the silent watchers around them, tall 
and proud.

At the Misty Edge of the Forest~
   The source of the mist introduces itself. A bubbling lake 
filled with crisp, icy water rushing past as the roar of the 
nearby waterfall churns the waters. The lake itself is quite 
old, as could be attested by the sheer rock face that makes up 
the sides of it. A small bit of frost has formed over the rocks 
themselves and covers the nearby foliage in a polishing layer, 
the water itself cold enough to eternally inflict that upon it. 
With the mist, the layer of frost upon things and the white of 
the trees, this part of the forest has an ethereal look to it.

   Dense stands of trees cluster around the rippling water of 
this lake, each seemingly vying for a spot closest to the water's 
edge. Tree boughs hang low over the water, nearly touching the 
tumbled rocks that are visible beneath the surface of the lake 
where it spreads across the forest floor. Lichen and moss crust 
over every rock in the stream bed, right down to the water's 
edge, the humble victors among the vegetation in the area.

   A passing breeze causes the mist to shift and billow into 
small plume-like shapes before settling down once again, 
eternally creating a hazy vision of white clouds throughout the 
forest. Young saplings have been annihilated, broken and 
shattered, littered all over and about the dust and dirt. Mud 
puddles lurk in more than one place, spurting out bubbles from 
time to time.

Within the Depths of an Old Forest~
   The forest floor is clear here, save for the occasional fallen 
limb or loose stone, a deep bed of dry needles and withered 
leaves whispering steadily underfoot at any rumor of passage. 
Though their movements are furtive, the flitting progress of 
nuthatches or occasional twitches of squirrels tails are easy to 
spy among the uncluttered trunks of the wood. Strong, old roots 
crawl like fat snakes over the earth while the colossal branches 
give a smothering shadow to everything below, allowing only 
dappled light to break through their leaves and limbs.

   The barks are a subdued, off tone of white, proclaiming 
partnership with the paleness of the mist, yet in outright battle 
and urge for dominance the piercing green of tall grass contests 
with the more subtle tints around it, bright and thick with 
health and vigor. Boulders, edges soft from countless ages and 
half-buried in ancient leaves, keep watch over thick patches of 
moss and miniature forests of mushrooms in their season. The 
distant echo of birdsong filters into this place from long before 
dawn until well after dusk. Mist consumes the forest, lending 
everything an ghostly argentite glimmer.

Beside A Fast-Flowing Lake~
   Facing uphill, to the north, the breeze is at times sweetened 
above the scents of pine and moss by hints of turf and loam, 
suggesting unseen meadows somewhere in the distance. Dense and 
hearty, mountain laurels, bearing white flowers in season, spring 
from among rocks and roots as the land climb. The trees begin to 
thin slightly here, enough so that through the spaces between the 
thick branches above, one can see the grey sheet of rock of the 
mountain, rising higher than even the tallest tree. 
   Westwards, the rushing water from the waterfall streams past 
in the lake, churning and ever producing a silvery mist that 
perpetually wafts in the air here and the bank steeps suddenly, 
offering a icy plunge into the cool water below.

East of a Slant Upon the Forest Floor~
   When this once-vast ash tree finally toppled, its deep roots 
exposed for the first time to light and wind, it dredged up to 
surface great quantities of raw earth and gray stones. High 
overhead, the canopy clothes the greater vault of the sky with 
reaching arms, filtering sunlight and starlight into angular 
swaths, each its own fragment of a shattered firmament. A flash 
of dark grey can be seen through the boughs of the thick tree 
branches, clearly defining the mountainside to the north.

The Edge of the Forest Beside the Mountain~
   The dominating presence of closely-knitted trees begins to

as the forest thins approaching the cliffside. A ridgeline, 
perhaps the last diminished remnant of some grander 
mountain-spur, makes passage here difficult for all but the most 
sure-footed and the air here is perpetually cool and somewhat 
damp and mists often linger in the treetops.

The Edge of A Forest~
   The large, roaring waterfall plummets to a crystalline lake 
below, little leaf-strewn brooks running in various veins in 
between the roots of the elder giants from there before 
disappearing into the forest. Thick drifts of discarded pine 
needles and rotted leaves fill the area beneath the stand of 
boulders, and a light earthy smell fills the air. The forest 
grows darker and thicker in all other directions but north, where 
the forest abruptly ends as the looming cliffside of the mountain 
rises up above the treetops as a dark grey wall of stone. 
   The rocky ground near the lake and waterfall afford little 
purchase here in the way of footholds, though a small crevice 
between the boulders allow one to climb up.

of rock rises amid the woodlands here, casting the forest floor 
into shadow for much of the day. Ivy runs rampant in the dim 
woods below, engulfing many of the straggling saplings and 
leaving in its wake strange, leafy-green hillocks and berms of 
foliage. Mice and other small creatures thrive in this carpet of 
growth, creating crisscrossing trails beneath the sheltering 
leaves.

here difficult for all but the most sure-footed. The ash and oak 
farther down the slopes yield to pine along the ridges uneven 
spine. Deadfall is plentiful here, dislodged rocks of all sizes 
collecting uphill of the fallen trees.

Approaching the Southern Edge of the Valley Forest~
   The boughs of the trees here bend only to the beads of 
luminance that invade upon their trunks from the maze of branches 
above. Little of it reaches the ground, and the area takes on a 
muted atmosphere. Fallen leaves are scattered everywhere, some 
already decaying and giving off a scent of musk as they mingle 
with the damp soil. Cobwebs oscillate the reflection of light 
from their moist strings, spanning from trunk to trunk in 
silvery-grey weave.

South of a Straight Course of the Forest Trail~
   It is within the shade that ferns come to thrive, the plants 
giant, small, old, and tall. But they are not alone; ivy has 
crept over many of the larger ones, embracing them with their 
suffocating hug. The air here is perpetually cool and somewhat 
damp, and mists often linger in the treetops. The hammering 
staccato of foraging woodpeckers often disturbs this otherwise 
quiet stretch of forest.

A Thinning Copse of Trees South of a Forest Trail~
   The area is alive not only in the varying hues of colors and 
their occasional clashing, but with a plethora of wildlife as 
well. Squirrels and a variety of birds, along with other forest 
animals, fill the forest, though their numbers dwindle near the 
southern end of the forest. There, the trees begin to thin 
towards a grassy meadow, contrasting with where the forest grows 
darker and thicker towards the north and west. A sense of peace 
pervades the still air near the meadow, though the light breeze 
often carries the scent of wildflowers on the air.

A Lush Meadow~
   The broad trunks of the surrounding wood give way here to a 
field of lush, green grass that expands east and south until it 
reaches the mountainside. Dense and hearty mountain laurels, 
bearing white flowers in season, spring from among rocks and 
roots as the land climbs. The valley floor rises and falls in 
gentle rolls, thick with herb, grass, and flower. The turf 
underfoot is deep and inviting, giving rise to all manner of 
flora.

A Peaceful, Flowered Meadow~
   No trees grow here, the entire meadow peaceful as the lush 
grass sways gently in the valley winds. Thick sheets of 
silvery-white mist roll just above the tips of the blades of 
deep, green grass, perpetually causing condensed water to form in 
small, clear droplets. These beads of condensation reflect all 
manner of light that touches them in a plethora of colors, making 
the entire meadow colorful and bright. Wildflowers lend to the 
vibrancy here, dashing color here and there between the grasses 
to contrast sharply with the dark grey of the valley wall that 
rises up to the south and east. 
   Cracks and jagged rocks line the mountain side, moss and weeds 
spurting from them to interrupt the grey sheet of rock with some 
rich greenery.

A Grassland Outside the Forest~
   Grove and glade give way to a broad, level stretch of open 
territory at the heart of this valley. Diverse grasses sway in 
the winds that blow from the mountains, their ranks swelled by 
thickets of blackberry and gorse. Frequent stands of barbed 
thistle sway at the height of a man's head. Bullfinches sport 
here in spring and summer by day, replaced in cooler months by 
flocks of starlings. Mere specks in the heavens, vultures and 
raptors ride updrafts from the warmer valley floor and at dusk, 
bats careen in and out of view above the tall grasses.

Within a Flowered Meadow~
   The ground to the south becomes slanted downhill in a sudden 
dip. Without much warning it droops rapidly, the lush, green 
grasses rising tall to an average man's knee. Wild flowers 
blossom in the grass, of all shapes and sizes, kinds and colors; 
it induces a chaotic, dizzying sight that's far from lacking in 
beauty. All the rest of the forest shies from this realm of 
grass and flower, but a singular large tree that grows in the 
center of the grove. It appears older than those which surround 
it to the outskirts.

in the center of the field, its branches barren and rattling.

   Darkness falls upon this field. It slants downhill in a dip,
shadows blanketing the grass and turning all colors dark blue.
Little is visible in the night, though a tree does grow in the
middle of the field, the nighttime wind blowing through its
branches.

Upon the Outskirts of the Forest~
   Forest meets meadow here as the trees begin to thin and the 
sparse grasses between their roots grow more lush and thick here. 
Replacing the general fauna of mushrooms and healthy ferns, 
scraggly bushes begin to show instead. As the sun rises several 
rivulets of light are permitted entry through the branches and 
dew scintillates as the mist partially parts on its stroke. 
Moonlight further enhances the silver tinge of this edge of the 
forest, reducing visibility to a great degree as it gives all an 
otherworldly quality.

Nearing the Outskirts of the Forest~
   The soil is so damp that any who pass over it would find their 
feet sinking slightly into the earth, the spirit of the forest 
here untouched and ancient. The turf is enriched into compost 
with eroded pine needles and cones, its redolence old and seeming 
to be characterized by undisturbed growth, for the area is a 
proverbial river of green and brown. The light is sealed out by 
the overhang of pine branches which are entrenched in sylphlike 
ivy, streaks of them hanging down in effervescent ropes. Plants 
and creepers know no boundaries or limitations to their growth.

   The turf underfoot is deep and inviting, giving rise to all 
manner of flora. The trees begin to thin slightly here, enough 
so that through the spaces between the thick branches above, one 
can see the grey sheet of rock of the mountain, rising higher 
than even the tallest tree. Still though, small bushes and tall 
grasses cover the forest floor, hiding the occasional fallen 
mountain debris that seek to trip the unwary. 
   The trees give way here to a flat expanse of grass, swaying 
peacefully in the wind.

A Meadow and Forested Area Against the Mountain~
   Boulders, edges soft from countless ages and half-buried in 
ancient leaves, keep watch over thick patches of moss and 
miniature forests of mushrooms in their season. The distant echo 
of birdsong filters into this place from long before dawn until 
well after dusk. The thinning copse of trees here eventually 
fades to an expanse of grassland that spreads westwards against 
the wall of the mountain.

steep, woodland vale from where the falls lie, at the western end 
of the valley, far away. When the wind shifts, plumes of vapor 
wash across the dense bracken that crowds the steep, rocky banks 
at this point. In winter these mists from the falls settle in a

breaks in the trees to the south. Beyond the shadow of the rock 
face, pines mix with hardwoods, some attaining considerable 
height. Mice and other small creatures thrive in this carpet of 
growth, creating crisscrossing trails beneath the sheltering 
leaves. Deadfall is plentiful here, dislodged rocks of all sizes 
collecting uphill of the fallen trees. 
   The valley wall rises up steeply to the east, forbidding the 
forest trees from continuing to grow.

   Dense and hearty, mountain laurels, bearing white flowers in 
season, spring from among rocks and roots as the land climbs 
here. Moss festers on the rough bark of the trees, almost no 
sunlight able to break through the shield of the tree canopy 
above, the massive network of old branches twined and laced 
together. The ancient trees around them stretch tall and regal, 
with the lowest branches being almost fifteen feet off of the 
ground.

out old growth tree stumps lie within the clearing, surrounded by 
a few scattered moss-covered logs. This peaceful glade lies 
tucked away in a break in the trees, sunlight dappling upon the 
grassy meadowed lawn.

possessing the gnarled, twisted quality of its brown-hued

subdued , off tone of white, proclaiming partnership with the 
paleness of the mist, yet in outright battle and urge for 
dominance the piercing green of tall grass contests with the more 
subtle tints around it, bright and thick with health and vigor. 
A massive spur of rock rises amid the woodlands here, casting the 
forest floor into shadow for much of the day.

the earth in middle of this brief clearing, the rocks dominating 
the land surrounding them. Dejected conifers grow to either side 
of the massive rockwork, and a few scrub pines grow from cracks 
in the formation. A damp mist continues consumes the forest,

   Filtered light does descend to the forest floor, touching on 
the wildflowers and brush eeking out a modest life there. Though 
the air is still, the dull roaring sound of a faraway waterfall 
permeates the atmosphere. Thick drifts of discarded pine needles 
and rotted leaves fill the area beneath the stand of boulders and 
a light earthy smell fills the air. The forest lies in every 
direction, but north and east where it thins to meet the valley 
mountainside.

inviting, giving rise to all manner of flora. Thin ivy-like 
vines make themselves evident, heavily tainted with small 
flowers, curling around the patterns belonging to the thick bark

and soft. The valley continues westward, to the edge of sight,

   The road bends here east and south between a few shanty homes 
though continuing eastwards along the road brings one to more 
sturdily-built buildings, seemingly merchant shops. The 
buildings are not closely-packed, space between each to roam 
easily and all gives off an ancient feel as if untouched by any 
humanoid presence for many ages.

North of a Blacksmith's Forge~
   The road curves from the west to straighten out here between a 
few merchant stalls, crumbling and collapsed from time. Ivy 
vines wend their way up around the posts of the stalls and 
everything seems ancient, the architecture simple and quite 
crude. The smooth, grey stones that line each side of the path 
are covered in moss and dirt, set between growing clumps of weeds 
and grass. 
   The road continues east and west past an open-air forge to the 
south, its roof collapsed.

the architecture simple and crude as ivy and moss grow up the 
crumbling stone walls of the skeletal, abandoned buildings. To 
the south stands a fairly sturdy bakery.

A Bend West and South in the Road~
   The road here bends south and west around a corner of 
crumbling, wood buildings. To either side of the road, thatched 
roofs are collapsed and the walls are overrun with thick, growing 
ivy and moss. Stones, grey and smooth, line the path leading the 
way through the ancient edifices, interrupted only by weeds and 
grasses that have pushed the stones away from the lining of the 
road.

dirt-packed road continues. It is lined to either side by 
smooth, grey stones, marking the path with mossy patches covering 
the walls of the wood and stone crumbles. The walls of all 
buildings are overrun by ivy, dark green and healthy despite the 
deadened feel of this abandoned village. Most buildings sport a 
collapsed, thatch roof or crumbling stone walls, but a quick look 
inside each would show obvious abandonment rather than a forceful 
departure.

   A silvery-argent mist rises up from the southwest over the 
edge of the plateau, dampening the area and keeping the 
hard-packed, dirt road somewhat moist underfoot. The two roads 
meet here to make a four-way intersection in this abandoned 
village, lined to either side by smooth, grey stones. Skeletal 
buildings rise to either side of the road, long since abandoned.

shop to the west and a low-fenced cemetery along its eastern 
side. Only a few grey stones continue to line the road on each 
side, the others rolled away, hidden in the long grasses that 
grow unhindered between the houses or long gone by the many 
storms that have ravaged this ancient, abandoned village. The 
silvery mist that rolls in from the southwest beneath the plateau 
casts all in an eerie haze. 
   The road continues to the north towards an intersection and 
southwards where the road bends.

to be ancient merchant shops, all simply made of rough wood and 
thatched roofs. Most are decrepit and crumbling, worn by time, 
though to peer inside a shop would show that the insides were 
left undisturbed and covered with dust and dirt, as if left 
abandoned. 
   A single clothier's shop stands to the south, separating a 
pair of roads to either side of it and seems remotely untouched 
as it is made from stone and stands sturdily.

dirt, a few scraggly weeds sticking out here and there along the 
way. Smooth, grey stones line the path all along the edges of 
the ancient buildings that rise up all around, small and simply 
made. The biggest of them all stands to the north, the tavern 
with the image of a boar in faded paint depicted upon the wall 
beside the doorway.

still erect though most have collapsed, weathered by the still 
within among other things. Stones continue to line the road 
here, smooth and gray though covered in mossy elements. The ones 
still standing seem abandoned, half-decayed furniture visible 
inside them.

to its rusty hinges.

stones line the road, marking it from the dirt that surrounds all 
of the other homes that rise up to either side. A soft fog of 
silvery mist continues to roll past and among everything here, 
creating a whitish, damp haze to blur the vision of the crumbling 
and collapsed edifices and casting an eerie feel to the entire 
village.

waterfall nearby, it's dull roar ever present here, buzzing 
through the air. Upon entering the village, crumbled ruins and 
ancient, skeletal homes rise up to either side of the path, 
unevenly spaced and simplistic in its style of architecture. 
Nearing the outskirts of the village, a few smooth, grey stones 
begin to line the path, others lost during the long ages past 
that this village has stood.

merchant buildings thin here as it approaches the gate, only bit 
of vegetation growing all around. Stones line the path to either 
side of the road as it leads past the gate into the cemetary 
beyond, small mounds of dirt visible from this side of the fence. 
Weeds and ivy twine up the ancient fence and even over the gate 
which is able to be opened, creaking loudly whenever swung.

sticks stuck into the head of each mound though a few bear stone 
heads, the ancient writing faded from time. Weeds and grass have

boar's head hangs nearby the bar, even the tusks preserved and 
gleaming in the light. The barcounter is quite long, spanning 
from one end of the room to the other, with a horde of tiny 
stools provided for those who wish to sit. Roomy tables stand 
chaotically here and there, some upon wobbly legs whilst other 
are newer and more sturdy in appearance.

of light reach the tunnel and the stone walls serve only to cage 
the cold and clammy temperatures and keep it there. Liquid 
covers the interior like the spittle from some kind of beast, 
gathering often and dripping down to puddles upon the ground. 
The water itself is murky and has a murky tinge to it. One can 
continue down the tunnel itself or return through the hole above 
onto higher ground. A smothering, musky smell emanates from 
further along.

Within A Secluded, Flowered Cove~
   Wildflowers of all shapes, sizes, kinds, and colors blossom in 
the grass, creating a sight that is dizzying and chaotic, but far 
from lacking in beauty. All the rest of the forest shies from 
this realm of grass and flower, but for a singular large tree 
that grows in the center of the cove. Its roots are like molten 
lava that had flowed freely over the earth at a stage, hardened 
now to a nearly unbreakable thickness, while the trunk tells a 
tale of history with small holes and mock shelters left by 
animals that had come and gone over time. 
   Petals are often whisked by the wind and carried over the 
grass, churned into small circles in the air up and out of the 
open cove. There is no ceiling here, leaving the area open to 
the elements. The crevice in the northern wall of the cove 
allows one to squeeze back out into the forest.

A Grove of Fireflies Deep in the Forest~
   The corded roots of the colossal trees permit a breathing 
space to a small, circular grove, the thick of the forest keeping 
its distance from the sudden sprout of stark viridian, thigh-high 
grass. While not much of an escape from the shadow of the trunks 
and overreaching canopies, tiny yellow-green bulbs light 
everything, aiding visibility even at the deepest hours of the 
night and the dimmest of the day. The number of fireflies is 
immeasurable, often flying together in small clouds that but 
serve to create sudden halos of color around what it might be 
they perch on. Root, tree, or grass. In addition, pastel shades 
of purple and blues come out in the forms of bluebells and 
lavender.

   This damp chamber resonates with a dull rushing, thundering 
sound that pours out the mouth of the cave walls to the north. 
Granite walls curve gently upwards from ankle deep pools of water 
in the floor, arching widely from the cave's center to an 
oppressively low ceiliing. A veil of mist hangs thick in the 
air, filming over every surface. 
   Curving a bit from west to north, the tunnel's passage is 
marked by a broken field of rocks. The scent of mildew rises out 
of the western opening tunnel opening.

On A Rocky Path Behind the Waterfall~
   The water rushes past on the eastern side of the narrow trail 
here, only an arm's length away as it falls down into the lake 
below. It gives a perpetually damp feeling here as mist rises up 
from the depths of the waterfall to flood the trail and give it 
an ever-present silvery haze. Westwards, the trail leads towards 
a cave behind the waterfall but down where it slopes, the trail 
continues.

Approaching the Edge of A Forest Beside the Waterfall~
   The trail continues here alongside the waterfall, creeping out 
from behind it in a downward-sloping mountain trail upon the 
mountainside. It is partially hidden by the jagged, grey rocks 
of the cliff where it heads farther east behind some large 
boulders to near the forest edge. The many green trees, a 
vibrant green and gold in color, can be seen just off the 
southeastern edge of the narrow trail, stretching the entire 
length of the valley floor.

Overlooking the Edge of A Forest Upon A Hidden Trail~
   Here, a very narrow mountain trail allows one passage 
westwards along the cliffside, slowly sloping upwards as it nears 
the waterfall. Jagged rocks and boulders hide this trail from 
the valley floor below and the path is strewn by many pebbles and 
debris. There is a gap through a crevice leading a short jump 
down to the forest floor below but the trail ends here.

A Low Hanging Chamber in A Cave Tunnel~
   A wide but shallow pool of chilled water stands to one side of 
this cave chamber, the miserly amount of water breeding mildew. 
The ichor coloured slime coats the area just around the pool's 
edge, but a few rough-hewn planks supported by a hand-rail skirt 
the edge of the tunnel, providing an easy passage. 
   Eastwards, the tunnel walls carry a low rumble and occasional 
splashes of water echo from that direction. The air grows staler 
to the south, though humidity remains thick in the air.

The Tunnel Narrows~
   The stone walls of this cave-tunnel are barren of life, but 
rich with cracks and striations, the variegated lines varying in 
texture as they alternate between hues of quartz and ebony 
coloured rock. The air is damp, the stone of the cave wet to the 
touch. As this tunnel courses from the north to the south, it 
gradually tapers to a crack in the southern rock wall. 
Northwards, the scent of mildew mixes with fresher air, carried 
along by the muted rumble of falling water.

Through A Tight Crack in the Rock Wall~
   Shaped like the void made by two hands pressed together in a 
prayer, this tight passage is slick with the moisture of the air 
around it, the grey granite walls of the crack coated with a 
mildewy slime. The stonework near the base of the crack is 
rough, making traveling difficult. A muted, throbbing vibration 
and rumble can be felt through cave-walls, the sensation 
accompanied by a faint sound of splashing water. 
   North and south the passage widens, fresher air carried by the 
northern opening. Overhead the tunnel walls draw together to the 
distance of but a few handspans. A dark crevice yawns beyond, 
too deep for light to penetrate.

A Tunnel Chamber Filled With Noise~
   The air in this wide tunnel passage is stale, the wet aroma of 
mildew permeating the air. As the chamber widens from either 
end, the acoustics in the tunnel change and echoes carry distant 
sounds in a cacophonous rush. Strangely devoid of anything save 
the moisture lining the tunnel walls, the entire space consists 
of barren rock. 
   A trickle of water slides out of the man-sized crack in the 
cave towards the north, the sound of it falling over rocks mixing 
with a louder, more powerful sound of a distant waterfall. The 
tunnel continues westwards.

At the Beginning of the Tunnel~
   Here lies the beginning of a hidden tunnel. The loud roaring 
of distant, rushing water echoes through the rough, stone walls 
here, soft and muted. The tunnel walls are the dark stone of the 
mountain, though slick and wet to the touch, a bit of 
silvery-greenish slime coating everywhere. A Wardenry outpost 
gate to the south provides access into and out of this tunnel.

Within A Large Cave~
   Fairly large and cavernous, this ample cave smells vaguely of 
dried blood and mold. Darkness is overpowering, with the only 
natural illumination the feeble amount that manages to come 
through the cave entrance. The most prominent feature might be 
the long claw marks that are etched deeply into the sheer stone 
wall and a splatter of long dried red resides at more or less 
neck height, covering the ground by that spot. Stalagmites are 
everywhere, testifying to the age of the cavern itself. 
   The exit to the cave is quite small, covered in shrubs from 
the outside.

Inside the Base of a Hollow, Oak Tree~
   The space within the tree is rather ample as the shell of bark 
is thin, eaten away by sickness or some other malady over time. 
In the wake of its destruction it leaves a hollow area wide 
enough for almost three people to sit within. There's little rot 
left, the smell that prevails that of earth and of the forest. 
There are traces of evidence to suggest that an animal had made 
its home here in the past, with the earth dug out and small 
scratch marks upon the interior. While not all that comfortable, 
it provides a somewhat safe and dry shelter.

   Solid, grey stone comprises this room. It is dim and very

utilized. It is spartan in feel, the design and architecture 
simple. The floor and walls are marked with a splattering of red 
and black, both in abundance. These dark strokes line the walls 
and doors, each one a foot or two in length. The floor is 
covered more with these stains, the residue of small pools 
spotted all over.

A Long Library (S)~
   This room continues the graceful hemisphere extending from the 
north, extending halfway around the tower with two curved walls. 
The outer curvature of curved wall of domed ceiling below forms 
the inner wall. The outer wall is the same aged grey stone as 
the rest of the tower, monotonous in its uniformity, but is 
covered up to about six feet in height by a long row of 
bookshelves mounted to its surface. A large stone fireplace 
along the north wall can be lit to provide warmth to the long 
chamber. The inner wall is beautiful the translucent 
leaded-glass panels of the dome, warped with age, glow with a 
soft light at all hours from the chandelier hung within the dome, 
giving the room a peaceful feel. A few desks face the dome, the 
soft light illuminating their work surface, while a larger pine 
work table occupies the middle of the aisle.

A Large, Cozy Kitchen ~
   This simple, functional kitchen has been recently built, 
noticeably newer than the southern portion of the compound. A 
modestly sized fireplace has been set in the northeastern corner 
for cooking, placed to the left of a stout door of oak that leads 
east into a small, walled-in garden. The floors are stone here, 
heavy slabs of slate that allow for easier cleaning, and 
ventilation is provided by a squat, small window placed to the 
right of the door, framed by heavy shutters that can be open or 
closed to shield the room from the elements. Doors to the north 
and south lead into various other parts of the compound, though 
the latter is noticeably thicker and more secure then the former. 
In one corner, a wide trapdoor with a heavy lock has been set 
into the stone floor, probably leading to a cellar of some sort.

walls, leading toward other exits. Small gardens have been grown 
and tended well on either side of the middle walkway, with a 
couple of hardy trees offering minimal shade in daytime. Large, 
barred gates to the south lead outside to the trail down the 
mountain. Stables have been more or less cut into the stone face 
on the west, and to the north the keep itself rises up, tall and 
grim in appearance. Sturdy, double-doors lead further inside, 
while an arch in the east wall reveals a path around to the side

always well-stocked. The room is large enough to accommodate the 
entire tower, for servants, residents and guests. Shelves are 
stacked up on each wall, particularly the east and west, as well 
as cooking stoves, ovens and other pieces of furniture. The 
kitchen is lit day and night by lamps in the walls. Servant 
quarters are to the south, beyond the door.

Stone Hallway~
   A stone spiral staircase opens out into a narrow hallway at 
the top of the tower. The hallway itself bends around following 
the tower's outer wall, opening out into other rooms. There are 
a couple of lamps bolted into the outer walls to fill the hall 
with light. The door to the east opens out to a high balcony, 
and the southern door leads to a large office.

Stone Hallway~
   The stone hallway contines from north to south. It is 
relatively narrow, though easily allows for a couple of Men to 
walk abreast along it. Lamps sit in niches in the walls, to 
provide light. A door to the east opens up into more guest 
quarters and to the south, the hall stops at another door, 
leading out into a stone balcony.

Servants Quarters~
   These quarters are modest. Neither spartan nor opulent in 
furnishings, they are designed to be practical. There are 
several bunks either side of the room, and each bunk has a chest 
of drawers or cabinet of its own. Lamps light the room from 
their positions in the walls. The room is large, yet not cold, 
and a couple of paintings decorate the walls to the west and 
east.

Private Quarters~
   These private quarters have been built into the eastern side 
of the tower and overlook the the Pelennor Fields below. The 
southern and western walls are straight, while the northern and 
eastern follow the gently curving contours of the tower itself. 
The window itself opens out to the east, immediately opposite the 
door to the west. The room is spacious, and modestly decorated 
with curtains and a couple of hunting trophies hung on the wall.

Well-Organised Private Study~
   This study is a picture of neatness and organisation. 
Everything therein has its own place and there is little or no 
dust anywhere inside. The stone walls and floor are quite 
smooth, and decorated with a few hunting trophies and tapestries, 
and lit with lamps. A single window looks outward to the east 
and a door leads into a private bedroom in the south.

with curtains across the windows. It is quite spacious, with 
plenty of room for a large, four-poster bed and a couple of 
armoires. Lamps are esconced in the walls to provide the room

High Stone Balcony~
   High upon the tower this balcony has an resplendent view of 
the Pelennor Fields which stretch out to the east. The door is 
quite secure, and prevents the worst of the elements from 
entering the tower itself. A high stone railing forms an 
adequate barrier around the balcony's edge. The area itself is 
large enough for several people to stand up here and appreciate 
the view.

carved stone railing, about waist-height on the average Man. The 
balcony is easily wide enough for several people to stand here 
comfortably.

A Path Around The Cabin~
   A path skirts its way between the shed and the side of the 
cabin, neatly cobbled with rounded stones embedded into the 
ground. A large iron gate is built into a fence running north 
for a good distance than turning east and running on alongside 
the road before looping back to the cabin.

   A grassy pasture extends into the horizon to the north, 
skirted to the west by Mount Mindolluin. A fence runs around the 
perimeter of the property, enclosing a small run of the stream to 
the north, which fills a modest pond before trickling away to the 
east. A large iron gate is set into the western end of the 
fence, and a door to the south leads back into the cabin.

A Balcony Overlooking The Pelennor~
   Build several feet out over the front of the cabin, this 
balcony has been newly erected. Unweathered wooden beams support 
the structure, made of the same wood the rest of the cabin was 
built with. A waist-high railing runs along the front, offering 
protection from falling to the ground below. To the west, the 
mountains can be seen in the distance, while the north and east 
give an excellent vantage to the expanses of the Pelennor fields. 
On either side of the glass-paned door are large windows to allow 
in a lot of light to the loft and the lower levels.

A Short Hallway~
   The same finished planks of hardwood lead through this short 
hallway, giving away to solid doors to the north and east and an 
open archway to the west, clearly identifiable as the kitchen 
area. A light colored wood has been used as molding and to trim 
the doorways, giving contrast to the hardwood of the walls and 
floor. Sconces light the hall on either side with a small flame, 
and a couple framed drawings hang from nails. A small rug spans 
the distance from the commons to the south to the northern door.

A Comfortable Bathing Room~
   A thin layer of lightly roughened stone has been placed 
underfoot, guarding the floor against the possibility of water 
leaking onto it and ruining the wood as well as a preventative 
measure to slipping on the otherwise smooth wood. A counter of 
polished marble runs along the eastern wall dipping to form a 
wash basin, set below a squared mirror. a tub set up for washing 
along the northern wall, with a short clothes line running 
overhead. A few racks have been set up on the opposite wall 
while a sturdy door leads westwards.

A Cozy Study~
   This cozy study features the same hardwood building materials 
and designs used throughout the rest of the cabin, with one wall 
set entirely with shelves and a window centered on the northern 
wall. Dark-blue billowing drapes can be used to screen out 
light, but otherwise a view of the fenced backyard, complete with 
stream and pond can be seen in the foreground of the massive 
mountainous landscape. A solid looking door leads out into the 
hallway to the south.

A Large Dining Room~
   This large dining room features two archways; the north 
leading into the kitchen area and the east into the commons. 
Windows set in the southern wall allow ample light when the 
deep-blue curtains are open. The walls and floor are finished 
with polished hardwood, fitted and joined perfectly. Molding of 
a light wood covers the seams, giving contrast to the dark walls. 
Studry wooden shutters can be used to cover the windows and block 
out the light. A short chain hangs from the center of the room 
over the table to hold a wooden chandelier, giving warmth and 
light to the room when lit.

A Grassy Field~
   On a gentle slope, this wooden field covers a modest amount of 
land. Long blades of grass that reach the height of about a

breezes while a freshly-painted wooden fence surrounds it, a gate 
set to the east leading towards a small cabin that can be seen in

cell have rusted and seem brittle to the touch. Dust covers the 
stone floor, though a scattering of old foot prints can be seen, 
all leading outwards. Grisly reminders of the rooms previous use

End Of An Old Dungeon.~
   The narrow hallway continues here, dusty and dark, built 
underground from stone, it has escaped the worst of the fire that 
once wracked the building. Taller then most men, and constructed 
from rusted iron bars, an entire gate streches from ceiling to 
floor to make up one entire wall of cells that lie to the north, 
south, and east. Once strong and solid, the iron has begun to 
rust. A thin layer of dust has settled over the area, not quite 
hiding the dried dark liquid that trails through the area. The 
doors to many of the cages are open, the locks having rusted so.

A Switchback Along a Hidden Trail~
   The trail cuts back on itself sharply here as it zags closer 
to the forest floor. Loose rubble and smaller rocks litter the 
path, making progress difficult and footing treacherous. Even 
from here, the roar of he waterfall is clearly audible, while the 
air remains damp with mist.

A Boulder Blocked Path~
   The trail remains narrow as it descends the last few feet 
towards the forest floor, hardly wide enough for two men to walk 
side by side without their shoulders brushing the slick stone 
walls of the chasm. Stubbornly, a large boulder bars the final 
steps towards the forest floor, wedged tightly into the chasm by 
some long ago rockfall.

A Stone-Walled Bedroom~
   Though not large, this rectangular room has an organized,
tidy feel to it that makes it seem much bigger than it is. There's
more than enough room for the sparse furniture, which is all very
carefully arranged. The stone walls are ceiled and plastered,
whitewashed and perfectly clean. The floor is pale oak and also
kept clean. The windows looking out to the west are shuttered.
   A red-painted door stands to the north.

A Wide and Spacious Closet~
   This spaciously appointed closet has several rows of neat, 
burnished wood shelving lining its extent. In the middle, a set 
of built-in drawers span from floor to ceiling, providing for a 
neat set of storage arrangements. A few small pockets, gridded 
out beside the drawers offer a place for the storage of maps or 
other rolled up articles. Wide, shallow drawers lie beneath 
them, the perfect place to store flat parchments. The light but 
musty smell of parchment permeates this space.

which have been sanded smooth and then caulked, to keep the 
temperature inside, inside, and the temperature outside, out. 
Overall, it has a rather warm atmosphere, with windows set 
adjacent the door that are made of clear, paned glass. Placed 
atop the floor in a heartening gesture are several rugs and bits 
of well-used, very comfortable-looking, furniture.

trees, providing some shade and a generally peaceful area between 
the two large compounds that can be seen through the foliage to 
the south and the north. A small, dirt trail leads through the 
trees to the yard north, a small, locked gate in the fencing as

A Broad, Gated Field~
   The land here is bare of any trees, bar a few taller oaks that
seem almost to be planted purposefully around the perimeter of
the area. Grey rock can be seen to dot the ground as it slopes 
away gently from the jagged length of the palisade to the north,
and ridges of the same grey stone, now worn and overgrown with
moss and grass, appear at particular intervals; remnants of
retaining walls perhaps, placed by hands now long forgotten to 
keep what precious topsoil there is from washing away with the
lay of the land. Heard over the occasional bleating of goats and
the daytime birdsong that is a constant, the distant rumble of 
rushing water is sometimes borne on the breeze.
   To the north, the rugged line of palisade can be seen, a 
rooftop visible just over its height. In all other directions,
the lands slopes away, and past the line of mature oaks that 
surround the area, the land becomes overgrown and wild once more.

planks and is covered by thick, brown canvas that is stretched 
over a protruding frame to shelter the merchandise within. A 
sturdy counter runs the width of the stall toward the back, a 
white cloth draped over its surface bearing the Thornhill Farm

Between The Steep Walls Of A Hidden Canyon~
   Little more than a deep gully, the walls of this narrow canyon 
tower to either side, at times drawing close enough to be brushed 
by a traveler's outstretched fingertips. The light of day 
lingers here only briefly and, while this place is mostly free of 
trees and brush, moss drapes the northern rock face in heavy 
swaths. While crooked, narrow, and boulder-littered, the path 
through the canyon is fairly easy to tread, owing to ages of silt 
that have collected underfoot, and those who pass this way find 
their progress swift. At the westernmost end of the gully, the 
hillside has slid down to partially block the path, though a gap 
remains. 
   Evidence of a rockslide is shown by a few rather large boulder 
that block the gap to the valley beyond. Pebbles and debris make 
this canyon rather dangerous as more rocks seem to rain from 
above with the smallest of sounds and breezes.

At A Boulder-Strewn Ford~
   Broadening here, the canyon's progress of some miles is broken 
by a swift-flowing watercourse. The chatter and hiss of the 
passing waters reverberate from a host of brown boulders that jut 
from amid the flood, offering a means of fording the waters for 
those with courage and steady balance. Downstream, to the north, 
a lingering haze suggests the presence of falls not far off.

Under Brown Hills~
   A narrow canyon, hardly more than a winding gulch, nestles 
amid the steep hill lands here. Though the calls of crows 
occasionally sound in the distance, this place is governed 
chiefly by stillness, hidden as it is from weather and all but 
midday sun. The rains of passing centuries have done little to 
soften the steep walls to either side, though they have deposited 
a thick layer of sediment underfoot, making passage through this 
place fairly swift and sure. To its eastern end, the canyon 
plays out amid boulders and scree. Sage and cedar thrust up 
between the rocks and, here and there, a gap between tall stones 
reveals a glimpse of green and fertile lands to the east below.

A Cramped, Underground Room~
   This room has been dug out of the ground, the walls supported 
by thick, oakean beams that push up the stone ceiling of the 
kitchen floor above. The ceilings are not high enough for a 
normal man to properly stand. The only entrance or exit is a 
hole in the wall, up in the far corner of the ceiling with a 
sturdy, wooden ladder allowing one to climb out.

Beneath The Floorboards~
   This room is void of any windows or outside light sources save 
where the opening was created in the floorboards above. It looks 
as though it has been unoccupied in some time, covered in a thin 
veil of cobwebs and dirt. The walls and floor are hard-packed 
and smooth, just wide and high enough for an average to stoop for 
clearance with the ceiling.

picture~
Upon closer examination of the carving into the clay of
the north wall, a mountain pass can be seen, featuring a
waterfall on the right side, and a line draw along what
could be a path. The line is intersected at even intervals
totaling at seven. The line begins at the waterfall, and
travels up the path, with a small arrow pointing to the

crude, but the markings itself look fresh compared to the

A Log Cabin's Front Yard~

into this yard. Flat stones form a walkway to the door of a wide 
cabin made of hewn maple logs, smoke rising from a stone chimney 
on the far side of a thatched roof. A window of thick, wavy 
glass looks out onto the yard, beds of herbs scattered below it 
on either side of the walkway. The yard extends to the north 
along the cabin's wall, a packed-earth yard visible within the 
fence's confines.

A Wide Hewn-Log Cabin~
   Wide and comfortable, this cabin is made of massive maple 
logs, hewn and fitted together for walls, rough-cut into wide 
beams, and cut and planed into flat boards forming a ceiling and 
floor. The entire area is the same pleasant light tan color, and 
has the pervasive scent of cut wood. A massive fireplace 
mortared fieldstones fills the west wall, its tapering chimney 
rising up and out of the cabin, providing both light and warmth 
to the whole room. The eastern end of the room is covered by a 
board ceiling and beams, but the western end by the fireplace is 
open, all the way up to the thatched roof above. A sturdy door 
on the eastern wall leads to the front yard, which is visible 
through the windows of thick, wavy glass that flank it, helping 
to further brighten the atmosphere beyond the hanging oil 
lanterns. Functional shelving, made of the same maple as the 
walls, covers the windowless northern wall except for a ladder 
bolted in place and leading up to the loft above.

   A ladder bolted to the northern wall provides access to this

the sides where the sleeping pallets line the walls, just enough 
room to crawl in and rest. The floor is made of wide, planed 
maple boards, simple construction that also serves as the ceiling

keeping the cabin warm and dry. The west end of the loft is

sickly carpet. The room, unlike the rest of the building, has 
braved the flames and remained largely untouched beyond the large 
amount of smoke damage that has come from it. The door to the

tattered and wrecked, providing no cushioning and only serving to 
cover the beneath. Lining the ceiling corners are many cobwebs, 
each hosting many spiders of various sizes, some the size of a 
coin and others larger. There are no windows, and only a single 
door leads out towards the eastern direction.

walls are stained a dark, sticky black and the thin layer of 
tattered carpeting is a bastardize mix of once-beige and black. 
Shelves line the walls, devoid of any contents. Instead, all 
that once was kept within them is left on the floor, everything 
of value missing. These various items are little bits of burnt 
paper, aged and useless tools and the broken bits and peices of 
armor. No windows allow light in or show anything of the

engulf the majority of the room. A small dining table surrounded 
by some chairs provides a spot of respite, and a simple window 
allows glances into a small garden behind the kitchen. Doors

tree. Subject to the whims of Arda, this tiny garden both 
suffers and enjoys the weather that nature provides. One corner 
of the small garden is dedicated to a small wooden cage, and 
wildflowers sometimes poke through the grass. A recent add-on 
has been made to this quiet place, a door that leads to the east.

Before a Large Barn Near the Heledhnen~
   Placed several dozen yards from a sturdy cabin to the west, a 
large barn formed from raw, unpainted timber has been erected 
here amongst the birchwood. Not too far in the distance to the 
north, the rush of water from the Heledhnen can be heard behind 
the immense structure, the sounds of various animals mixing to 
form the peaceful song of the wilderness. The barn itself towers 
over the cabin it rests near, a solid three stories in height, 
with massive double doors built into it's southern face to allow 
entrance into the structure.

Within a Towering Barn~
   This three story rectangular wood structure is made from 
whipsawn lumber and hand-hewn beams. The frame of the barn is 
made almost entirely of pine with a large loft above the main 
floor accessed by a sturdy wooden ladder, and series of ropes 
hang from the high ceiling in what seems like a crude pulley 
system to haul items into the loft. In the northwestern corner 
of the barn a cow stall has been constructed from long horizontal 
planks of wood that provide a low fence like enclosure. Various 
shelves, bins and tools line the eastern wall in a neat and 
orderly manner, lending itself to the character of the owner. 
Heavy double-doors have been set within the southern wall of the 
barn, while the western wall contains a much smaller door with a 
small garden beyond. Small beams of light are able to penetrate 
though the seams of the wood that also provides a little 
ventilation. The scent of fresh pine and straw is prominent and 
lingers throughout the structure.

An Open, Airy Loft~
   Constructed of smoothly sanded pinewood planks, this loft 
looms two stories above the main floor, spacious enough for quite 
a bit of storage, yet only a fraction of the size of the main 
room below. Spanning the width of the barn from east to west, 
the loft juts south from the northern wall out to perhaps a third 
of the total depth of the structure. Open enough along it's 
southern edge to view the room below, a sturdy, waist-high 
railing is present to help prevent one from falling, while 
remaining low enough to not impede anything hoisted up into the 
loft itself by the crude pulley system that has been built to aid 
transfer of stored items. Through a small trap-door set into the 
southern end of the floor, one might ascend or descend by means 
of a sturdy wooden ladder.

A Path Around the Compound~
   Following the southern wall of a large compound, this narrow, 
heavily trodden path curves gradually to the north as it rounds 
the southwestern corner of the structure, and to the east it 
continues all the way up to an enormous barn seen in the 
distance. The birchwoods have begun to recede here, giving way 
to the Heledhnen tributary that lies not far to the north, the 
sound of fast moving current mingling with the crisp scent of 
fresh water flowing from the peaks of Mindolliun to eventually join 
the Anduin to the east. To the south, the birchwoods grow 
denser, the tops of it's many trees growing together to form a 
thick canopy that threatens to blot out the sun. A small lean-to 
has been erected to one side of the path, where a squat 
smokehouse awaits use.

corner of the structure and out of sight, and just to the east, 
set in the oak logs of the building, a stout wooden door has been 
placed, allowing entrance into the building. The great 
birchwoods lay to the south, growing denser as they move further 
inland away from the tributary.

The Western Bunkroom~
   Built sometime after the initial construction of the compound, 
this long, rectangular room has been formed from heavily sanded 
white oak, the walls and floor free of staining or paint. Most 
likely intended to be used as a common room for those who live 
within the compound, this chamber bears a large fireplace of 
thick blocks of grey stone, the chimney rising up to disappear 
into the ceiling above, and to the east, a wide archway provides 
egress into a broad, spartan training chamber. Set high in the 
northern wall, a large window framed by sturdy shutters has been 
placed to allow sunlight in during the day, and cool air during 
the warmer seasons. Somewhat narrower then the opposing archway, 
a stout door of solid oak has been cut from and placed within the 
thick wooden logs forming the western wall, leading outside the 
building.

A Broad Training Center~
   Thick oak logs that have been sanded smooth form the northern 
wall of this broad chamber, heavily trodden oak planks used to 
make the floor beneath your feet. The spartan decor and weapon 
racks, combined with a raised platform set squarely in the middle 
of the chamber leave little doubt as to the function of this 
room. If one were to look hard enough, small stains formed from 
drops of sweat and blood can be seen, having soaked into the raw, 
unpainted wood before they could be cleaned, suggesting this room 
sees quite a bit of use, most of it painful. A window set in the 
northern wall allows the scent of the nearby river to waft 
through the room, and heavy shutters allow the room to be 
shielded from the elements if need be. Archways set in the 
western and eastern walls lead to various other parts of the 
compound, and a wide door of oak has been set in the southern 
wall.

   Built from slightly newer timber then the southern half of the 
compound it rests within, this spacious room was evidently an 
addition made after the initial construction. Large oak logs 
form the northern and eastern exterior walls and while bearing no 
stain or paint, they have been sanded smooth to the touch, sealed 
with pitch to keep out the elements. Evidently intended to be 
used as a bunkroom, several beds line the eastern and northern 
walls, a small bin set at the foot of each. To the west, a wide 
archway provides egress into a broad training chamber, and in the 
southern wall, a large window looks out into a serene garden.

A Serene Garden ~
   Leading from the compound to the west, a wide path of closely 
joined and mortared grey stones has been trenched into the rich 
Anorien soil, encircling a large stone well in the center of the 
area before continuing its way towards a door set in the western 
side of a large barn. Wide enough for a couple to walk hand in 
hand, it provides ample passage to preserve the well tended, 
plush green grass and fauna surrounding this havenesque garden 
from being heavily trodden. Though the area is not expansive or 
vast, it is certainly large enough to support the growth of 
numerous flowers and bushes, as well as the small trees which 
line stone walls five feet in height to the north and south. The 
scent of the nearby river, pleasant and crisp, is strong here. 
Along the northern wall, narrow viewing slits are cut at 
intervals.

A Spare Bedroom~
Adjoining the larger main chamber of the compound via a small
door set in the western wall, this room appears to be intended
for use as a spare bedroom for guests or children. The oak forming
the walls and floor of this room have been sanded smooth, left
their natural color to show off the beauty of the wood itself.
Set slightly higher then normal in the southern wall, a small
window has been placed, flanked by sturdy, darkly lacquered
shutters to shield the chamber from the elements outside. While
by no means large, this room appears rather comfortable, the
scent of the forest and tributary outside carried within its
walls.

An Intimate Bathing Room~
   Dominating this chamber, a large porcelain tub rests in the 
center of the room and tends to be the focal point upon entering. 
Heavily lacquered, the hardwood floors bear a glossy shine while 
also providing protection from the moisture and dampness 
generated by the baths taken here. A brazier sits in the 
northwest corner, providing warmth and a light glow when lit, 
further adding to the intimate nature of this room. For the most 
part the room is open and spacious with very few furnishings, 
though a white oak cabinet has been bolted to the eastern wall to 
provide storage space, and a small washbasin has been placed to 
stand beside it. This room has no windows to provide optimum 
privacy and the scent of jasmine and soap is prominent due to the 
lack of ventilation. Set in the southern wall, a wide archway

A Freshly Built Bastion Armoury ~
The small space offered by this sub-storage room has been put 
to the best of its use, chests and weapon racks going under 
multi-layered shelves all under the constant light of a lamp 
hanging from the centre of the ceiling here. Meeting here are 
the faint aroma of wet leather and the hint of lamp oil, yet the 
smell is not repugnant, merely curious to the nose. A stout
door leads back into the southern room.

The Raven's Gambit~
   This small stall is dressed neatly in black and green linens. 
Carefully arranged and impeccably sorted shelves and drying racks 
along each side of the stall display a variety of fresh and dried 
herbs and bottled mysteries. 
   To the back of the stall a large block of granite has been 
carved into the shape of a raven, perched in such a way as to 
appear to be watching the comings and goings of the stall's 
occupants. Nearby the statue, crates are turned on their sides 
to form the base of a simple counter and serve the dual purpose 
of holding a variety of candles for sale by the stall's keeper.

A Spacious Training Ground~
   Bordered on the east and south by the high walls of the 
courtyard, this area has been cleared to make room for a large 
training area. A dirt path from the west leads through the 
middle and does a right-turn to the north toward a large building 
used as a forge. Torches have been set in the inner and outer 
walls to provide light, and throughout the area are spaces for 
archery practice, as well as combat rings. There are several 
crates and weapons racks stacked along the outer walls, and the 
south-eastern corner is almost entirely devoted to the storage of 
such things.

   The walls and floor of this large forge are carved out of the 
same mountain stone as the rest of the Tower that overshadows it. 
Armor, weapons, and other metal items in various stages of 
completion hang from the walls as well as various tools and raw 
implements. A large chimney made out of stone is on top of the 
ceiling to allow the smoke and heat to escape the building even 
though the room is always warm. There are lamps esconced in the 
walls to provide extra light, and a door to the south leads out 
into a spacious training area within the Keep's courtyard.

   Wooden floors sweep outwards from the simple doorway, 
stretching to every corner of this small room of the cabin. The 
door itself is made of oak, like the rest of the cabin, and is 
decorated as well as reinforced with iron bandings and small 
carvings. A stone fireplace sits on the northern side, simply 
but sturdily built. Windows dot the entire room, long and thin 
windows providing a goodly source of light during the day. 
Shutters allow them to be barred during stormy weather. A rug 
sits before the fireplace, made of soft deerhide. Stairs lead 
upwards in the northeastern corner. 
   The stairs lead upwards to a charred and blackened ruin, with 
most of the ceiling exposed to the elements.

   A small path makes it way towards a cabin here, the plants and 
wildflowers on either side carefully trimmed and tended. The 
brook can be seen just near the cabin, the sound trickling over 
even here. The path ends at a small porch and a sturdy-looking 
door facing away from the brook. 
   Fire has extensively damaged the path here and the cabin 
itself. The entire roof has been blown away by what seems to be 
a lightning strike, though the lower walls seems not badly 
damaged.

A Circular, Stone Bunkroom~
   This room is a perfect circle, its walls and floors seamless 
and smooth, not a single crack found in its entirety. Bunks of 
stone have been carved smoothly into existance along the bend of 
the circular wall, some eight of them branching from the wall, 
with another sitting in the middle of the room. The posts of the 
solitary bunk in the middle, having been carved from the mountain 
itself rather than outside materials, sink directly into both 
floor and ceiling, giving any with slight claustrophobia a fierce 
case of the willies to see, much less sleep in.

and hurried rather than the product of time carefully spent. 
This room is roughly circular, its walls uneven and crude and 
extend only roughly six or seven feet from the base of the 
stairwell, save towards the north. A tunnel stretches into the 
northern stone of the mountain, it hewn with a bit more care than 
the surroundings.

The vague shape of a small, narrow stairwell can be seen to the 
north, while this area slants only deeper into the shadows below. 
To one of astute observation of details, it could be seen that 
the tunnels zig-zags slightly back and forth in its path.

   After following the above slope down and into this area, it 
would lead to a number of small, stone buildings that appear to 
be small houses, built wholly out of the surrounding stone, 
their bottoms merging seamlessly with the mountain. Time and 
care has been spent on these small dwellings, making them 
acceptable and easy upon the eye, if a bit bland and lacking in 
the decoration category. Beyond this small outcropping of 
civilization, a long, black tunnel stretches westwards.

   This area serves as a sort of plaza or some sort between the 
three buildings that are arranged around it in a triangle-esque 
fashion, even going so far as for a few stone benches to have 
been carved into the darkness of this underground tunnel system. 
The northern-most building appears to be the largest, then the 
eastern, then the southern being little more than what seems to 
be an almost pantry-esque sized structure. All of the buildings, 
however, seem to have been constructed out of the same stone as 
the floor and ceiling of this area.

A Forsaken Stone Warehouse~
   This stone building is massive in the extreme, despite the 
rotted state of the crates that still remain within it and the 
layers of dust that have clustered over all that is present. The 
spoiled wood of the various crates and boxes has broken, and 
within it seems any number of mining impliments such as pans, 
mining picks of exquisite quality, and old lumber to be used as 
beams. The stone of the building itself, however, has been 
smoothed down with a supreme skill, and this building still 
stands as a testiment to the skill of its creators.

this bunk house still holds an aura of being deserted and 
abandoned, the number of small, vaguely child-sized skeletons in

to this illusion; rather than being abandoned, it was instead a

Inside a Roughly Carved Tunnel~
   This tunnel has been roughly carved from the surrounding 
stone, as if it had been carved in some great rush or there was 
some sort of urgency to the project. Rather than being smoothed 
out or even made flat, the floor in this area is still rounded, 
narrow, and rather cramped, as if it had been made for travelers 
smaller than your average Gondorian. While the tunnel is rough 
and has small upward or straight jogs it does, for the most part, 
lead in a steady downward path.

Clustered Around a Dark, Dank Hole in the Floor~
   The tunnel ends here with startling abruptness; there is not a 
single dentsworth of progress on the western wall. The gradually 
sloping grade that leads to this area terminates simply at a 
completely vertical hole in the floor that leads straight 
downwards. The below darkness holds a nature of foreshadowing, 
the light of torches, candles, and other mundane sources of 
illumination having a very serious trouble penetrating that 
darkness. A sound rises up from the below hole, constant, 
steady, and ponderous, it sounds as if it is the breathing of 
some great, monstrous animal.

The Black Heart of the Mountain~
   This area is of amphitheater size, enormous in its capacity

from the teaming number of monstrously large, nightmare-black 
mushrooms. They have blossomed in wild abundance, covering the 
walls, the floors, the ceilings, the entirety of available space, 
and this great cavern is filled with the sound of their 
breathing, the steady inhalation and exhalation of their fumes. 
The light of any torch or lantern penetrates only some few feet 
before its bearer making navigating this black morass quite the 
affair, as trespassers cannot even see their own knees.

wall, light coming from it as it heats the room when lit. The 
room is spacious enough to be able to hold several people in it 
and have a table with plenty of room for people to move around. 
Wooden shelves have been built into the eastern walls. On the 
western wall a window with maple-shutter has been built upon 
eye-level to be able to admire the beautiful grass and farmland 
of the Pelennor Fields. A pale, grayish wool curtain separates

various items. The walls have several shelves and hooks to store

   This airy room, lit by windows overlooking paddocks, serves as

laden with grooming tools and equine accessories. Bridles hang 
from hooks, and numerous saddles rest upon thick rounded trestled 
logs, either awaiting cleaning, or gleaming brightly. Hay is 
stored in a low loft here, filling the area with sweet pungent 
scent. Opposite the heavy shelves a series of bins line the 
wall, filled with equipment and various feeds. An ostler busies 
herself here, often bringing the rhythmic sound of 
horse-grooming, or the jingle of harness being cleaned to your 
ears.

gaze out into the stable itself. Light comes primarily from a 
large window set in the eastern wall of the building. Against 
this wall are frame structures, constructed to support and store 
heavy barding, and battle saddles. Various types of head harness 
and bridle hang from hooks on the wall to the side of the window,

A Recent Extension~
   Through a southern iron-banded doorway, access to this room is 
usually barred by a bolt and lock. This extension has recently 
been added to the barn's north side, a new stone wall rising up 
to a flat ceiling of bare timbers. The floor is pine-planked and 
stained to a golden hue. Wide enough to fit two beds stretched 
out with room to walk in between, this dormitory extends thirty 
feet northwards before ending at a plastered wall, which bears 
the emblem of a dove flying from the heart of a rising hawk, 
painted in rich colors. This room bears the scents of recent 
construction. A large hatch is set at the far north end under

from the ground with thick walls reducing the storage room 
inside. Indeed, the stone floor is bone-dry and the plastered 
walls are grey and rough to the touch. Higher than the tallest 
man, the ceiling is similarly finished. Large enough to store a 
great deal of equipment, this chamber is accessed through a large 
hatch above.

A Stone Paved Courtyard~
   Set apart from the small garden to the south, this courtyard 
has been laid with heavy pieces of flag stone, river rock filling 
the joints between to create a solid surface underfoot. A low 
stonewall to the north encloses the space between the compound 
and the barn. A massive forge dominates the northern end, 
enormous and clearly brought here by many men in pieces before 
being assembled. To the east, the courtyard butts up against a 
single story building which seems to be an addition to the 
towering barn looming to the southeast; a single door providing 
egress to the interior. The scent and the sound of the nearby 
Heledhnen tributary waft in from the north, and to the south, 
beyond the garden, the looming trees of a birchwood can be seen. 
A stone wall built of river rock, much like the northern wall, 
now blocks the southern path, stretching between the buildings 
and enclosing the space. There are narrow viewing slits in the 
wall but no door.

A Spacious Workshop~
   Longer than it is wide, this rectangular room seems to have 
been designated to serve as a workshop. Large wooden bins line 
the smoothly sanded pinewood northern wall. To the west a 
heavily built door leads out into a stone paved courtyard and to 
the south a large double-door frame, free of actual doors, opens 
up into the main part of the barn. Various workbenches have been 
clustered around a heavy table that dominates the center of the 
room. A large rectangular window is set high above the wooden 
bins along the northern wall allowing light to filter in during 
the day. The window is flanked by heavily lacquered shutters 
that might be closed to ward against the elements beyond these 
walls. The scent of cut wood lies heavy in the air, though it is 
laced subtly with the taint of ash and fire, the smell growing 
stronger toward the western end of the room.

A Small Holding Cell~
   This small cell is cold, damp, and uninviting. The ceiling is high
enough for a man to stand upright and it is large enough to hold a bed
or two at most. An oil lamp is esconced securely in the wall,
providing some dim light for the chamber. Moisture from above dampens
the rock that makes up the walls and ceiling. Iron shackles are bolted
to one wall and straw partially covers the stone floor. An iron bound
door to the south is the only exit out of this room.

   This sturdy room is approximately ten feet square with
walls of squared oak logs and floors of smooth birch planks.
A low ceiling constructed of the same squared oak logs
overhead keeps the weather out. Iron-bound doors are set
into the northern, western, and southern walls. Polished
brass wall lanterns are mounted on either side of the 
eastern entrance to provide light.

A Small Cell~

The walls are of squared oak logs, expertly fitted together
and chinked with a grey mortar instead of mud. The low
ceiling is constructed with squared oak logs as well while
the floor is covered by smooth birch planks. It measures
approximately six feet by eight feet, barely enough room
for a cot or pallet to sleep on.  The only light comes from
a small barred window set into the door.

A Heavily-Wooded Sloping Tract of Overgrown Land~
   This densely forested area begins at the crown of the hill and 
sweeps down to its foot where it opens into a loose clearing. 
The clearing is coated in lush deep grass over which shadows 
play, as any available sunlight finds its way through the thick 
canopy above. The forest floor beneath the trees is coated with 
a thick carpet of ferns which deaden footfalls and rustle as 
animals move among them. 
   A cabin sits on the western edge of this wood, jutting out 
above a sheer drop off the hillock. Two others are set in the 
northern area near the fence and a final cabin has been set 
against the southern fence.

A Stable Off the Mountain Trail~
   Throughout the barn, a thin layer of hay has been scattered 
over the floor. The floor is made up of a hard packed earth. On 
each side of the barn, stalls are line up with doors that swing 
open and shut so that the horses can be easily lead in and out of 
their stalls. Along the eastern wall is a large window, letting 
those inside open it to release the stench of manure that fills 
the stable.

becomes. The dirt on the ground has been packed hard by the 
horses that travel along through to and from the stable.

A Sheltered Overhang on the Cliff Face~
   This deep overhang is sheltered to the south by a grey face of 
rock, concealing it from would be onlookers on the canyon floor 
below. It is relatively bare save for a few ferns and vines 
which cascade in front of the overhang from somewhere above. It 
is quite dry , though rain occasionally caresses the more exposed 
southern end of the overhang. Through a gap in the cliff wall to 
the east and past the closer peaks of the mountain, the Pelennor 
fields stretch out, reaching the birch wood.

A Dry, Underground Cave~
   This small cave, accessible through a narrow tunnel opening 
from the overhang, is quite dry. The floor, mostly a sandy 
substance likely blown in through the above opening, has been 
covered with ferns and foliage which crunches lightly underfoot. 
The walls are a bare white-grey rock while the cave itself is

Lond Anorien, South of a High Wooden Gate~
   Irregular flagstones are sunk into a muddy stretch of earth 
here to form this length of the Lond Anorien. Rickety timber 
buildings with wood-shingled roofs stand here, their high frames 
casting shadows over the highway in the daytime. To the south 
the road here courses on, bending gradually to the west after a 
distance as it winds through the small township of Milton. Northward 
a wooden wall rises, and is set with a broad, double-doored gate 
that permits access to a compound beyond.
   A small shelter with a sloping roof has been built along the wall
just to the west of the gate. It is constantly manned by members of
Lord Astirian's Wardenry.
   Several tall lamp posts are erected alongside the road here.

Atop a Barren Bluff~
   Beyond the protective copse of oak, the hills become more 
rugged and are studded with gray outcroppings of weathered stone. 
The wind prowls ceaselessly here, muttering and whistling among 
the rocks and gorse. By day raptors can sometimes be seen far 
above, spying out the land before returning to their secret 
aeries. East and west the rocky hills continue in their ramble, 
echoing the greater slopes of the White Mountains that dominate 
the skyline to the south. To the north the ground slopes away 
sharply into a series of rocky defiles and thorn-choked, dead-end 
gullies. There is little sign of either wildlife or forage in 
this place.

A decently sized changing room.~
   The walls of this room are skillfully carved of a light wood 
that has the same qualities of birch. The room would seem to be 
of modest size that could house several people while they changed 
clothing. To the south a curtain is set so that noone can see in 
or out of the room unless opened. Along the walls a set of 
shelves are located so that items may be stored temporarily. The 
floor is made out of the same wood as the rest of the walls and a 
bench runs down the middle of the room allowing access to the 
shelves yet letting those who enter have a place to sit.

At the Top of an Ancient Staircase~
   Solid, grey stone rises up through the spiralling staircase to 
a flat landing marked as the top of the tower. The structure can 
easily be defined as being built for defense, only a thin, arrow 
slit at the top of the landing allowing a view from the outside 
without being vulnerable. Heavy, oak doors lead into rooms to 
either side of the staircase though the western door is also 
barred in iron.

the utmost care and quality and a thick carpet of leaf green 
covers the floor from wall to wall, a large, oak bed dominating 
the middle of the room. The tiniest slit of a window allows air 
to flow through the room though a shutter is attached to block 
out the elements when neeed. The only way out of the room is the 
heavy, oaken door, barred with iron.

Upon A Trail South of the Quarry~
   A trail marches up a slight slope of the mountain now, 
scattered rocks pebbling the dirt path. The peak of the mountain 
to the south-west is covered in snow all year round and is 
visible from here, the craggy mountain forming the western border 
for the entirety of the Fields, areas covered in thin scraggly 
vines. The ground here becomes steadily more rocky and rough as 
one continues up the trail northwards where a tall, iron 
gatehouse rises up in the distance.

Before A Metalsmith's Forge~
   Upon the mountain slope here, the trail ends as it approaches 
a stone building set to the north. The building itself is 
surrounded by the rocky face of the mountain, hidden from view of 
the trail until one rounds a bend in the path to its entrance. 
Its doorway is unnaturally large, framed in heavy oak and the 
whole shop seems to be quite old.

many. It is as well, rather orderly, many shelves lining the 
walls while a large stove and hearth dominate another. The room 
itself is made of stone, so as to prevent the spread of fire in 
case of an accident and set above the stove is a high window, cut 
into the wall, allowing for air to flow through the kitchen while 
not large enough for even the smallest of men to fit through.

   From this vantage point one can look out over the fertile
fields of Pelennor to the south and the fields and birchwood
of South Anorien to the North.  The village of Wardog's Green
is visible in the distance to the south and the massive walled 
city of Minas Tirith is several more leagues southwest.
Crennelations along the north and south provide cover for anyone
atop the wall here.  Below are the reinforced gates of the 
Rammas Echor where Lond Foroden Annui becomes Lond Anorien as

from attackers.  The lands of South Anorien stretch out to the
north while the Pelennor Fields are to the south.  To the west is
the imposing Mt. Mindolluin.  The wall stretches out east and
south as far as they eye can see.  A reinforced trap door leads

Inside of a Small Cozy Cottage~
   This small cottage is large enough for one or two people to 
live in. Its walls are painted white and slightly faded. The 
floorboards are made of oak, and well polished. Three windows 
adorn the wall, and a large, secure door leading outside.

Wide Oak Farm~
   A short, stone-lined path leads up to the messy yard of this 
modest farmstead, an off-white picket fence surrounding the 
weed-filled area. The farm itself is the very picture of rustic 
domesticity, a one-story cottage with a red-brick chimney to the 
north, the walls covered in growing ivy vines while its windows 
peek out over the wooden porch into the yard. 
   A gated opening in the fence leads out into a pasture beyond 
which one can see a recently repaired barn.

A Well-Worn, Cozy Commons~
   A sturdy, oak door leads into this rather cozy common room, 
the area not overly large though spacious enough to accomodate 
quite a big family. The walls are made of wood, as are the 
floorboards which are well-worn with the passage of time though 
the area around the red brick chimney has also been inlaid with 
stone to prevent the spread of fire. The room seems to be used 
for many of the daily activities, shelves and cabinets lining the 
walls and even a stove tucked into the corner of the room nearby 
the wide windows that look out into the front yard. 
   Two doors leads west and north into other rooms of this home.

A Large Field Before a Recently Repaired Barn~
   Upon a gentle slope, this large field covers a modest amount 
of land, long blades of grass growing as tall as a man's calf 
covering the ground and rich, moist dirt beneath. The field is 
left unfenced, open to the Anorien though it is set within a 
clearing. Just to the west, one can see a modest cottage in the 
distance and just a bit past, the well-traveled road of Lond 
Anorien. 
   A narrow, dirt path leads through the field off to the east 
where an ancient, large barn stands, having been recently 
repaired. 
   A sturdy bunkhouse has been constructed along the northern end 
of the field, adjacent to the barn. Fastened to the front of the 
bunkhouse and barn, several lanterns hang to offer a dim glow 
about the surrounding fields.

   This room, like the rest of the house, is quite sturdy though 
the worn floorboards creak with age. It is modest in size, 
spacious enough to accomodate a few pieces of furniture though a 
bed dominates most of the area, set beneath a window that looks 
out behind the cottage to the north where Lond Anorien leads to a 
bridge over the Heledhnen. A sturdy door leads south back into

A Cluttered, Large Barn~
   Not suited for anything in particular, this wooden barn is 
built to store and house nearly anything to do with field labor. 
The floor of the barn is nothing but dirt and is evenly leveled 
throughout with hay strewn about the floor to insulate. Stalls 
of all sizes for various animals are situated strategically here 
and there to keep the animals apart and provide at least some 
order to the clutter. Along the walls, racks, pegs, and hooks 
hang from the wall with assorted tools dangling down them. The 
constant scent of animal hangs in the air here with an underlying 
scent of hay and dirt. Built into one of the walls is a large 
hayloft which seems to have rained hay all about the ground and 
workstations around it.

A Cozy, Low-Ceilinged Living Room~
   The ceiling of this smallish room is very low - the average 
human would have to bend over significantly or maybe even crouch 
to move about in this home. The main room has been dug into the 
barrow with dark pine walls and floors, which are exceptionally 
smooth. A white stone fireplace has been built against the 
southern wall. The door against the northern wall is oval-shaped 
and two windows rest adjacent on both sides, windowsills resting 
underneath them. Pinewood has created a floral design on the 
clear glass windows, and let in natural light. The style of the 
home seems very foreign, support beams protruding from the floor, 
against the wall, and to the wavy ceiling - even two from the 
floor straight to the ceiling. The architecture allows for cool 
summers and warm winters. To the western side of the house, a 
bedroom is visible. To the eastern side of the building, a 
kitchen can be recognized.

A Small Yet Cozy Low-Ceilinged Bedroom~
   This bedroom is cramped by human standards, but looks cozy all 
the same. The west and southern wall both have windows that let 
in natural light, and windowsills to view the birchwoods beyond. 
The walls and floors of the exotic-styled bedroom are pinewood, 
like the living room, and support beams move up the walls and 
towards the coned roof. The room is very cozy with its dark 
pinewood and its underground heating that keeps it warm in the 
winter.

with many support beams up the walls like the main room. A 
single window has been placed against the eastern wall, giving a 
pleasant view out to the birchwoods. Pinewood counters have been 
built against the eastern wall, under the window. Against the 
northern wall, there is an indentation that looks to serve as a 
small pantry. The style is old fashioned, but seems exotic like 
the living room.

A Large Common Room~
   This large room is divided into two sections by a railing 
which which rises to mid-height. The railing separates a lowered 
den-like living area from an elevated, larger dining area. The 
walls are of a light hickory wood and the floor has been given a 
darker tone of wood with the occasional fur rug placed about the 
floor for insulation and comfort. On each side of a large wooden 
door sits a window equipped with wine red curtains hanging down 
to be adjusting to allow lighting. The room has a homely feel to 
it and while comfortable and warm, it could be described as 
quaint or simple. On the walls furthest from the main door, two 
doors lead into separate directions.

In the Icy Waters of a Long Lake~
   The chill waters of this long, narrow lake are clear, but both 
the steady current that tugs swimmers southward and frequent 
gusts off icy wind from off the shoulders of the White Mountains

Among the Churning Waters of a Mountain Lake~
   The icy waters that press in from all sides become more 
turbulent here as the lake bed rises swiftly underfoot, thrusting 
spurs of smooth rock up from out of the depths below. The 
current is strong, pulling toward the south and the place where 
this mountain lake has found its outlet through a narrow canyon. 
While rippling waters stretch away to the north and west, to the 
east the lake slaps against a frowning escarpment of gray rock 
where sharp fissures give entry to a dim cave.

Within the Darkness of a Wide Fissure~
   Long ago, under the relentless pressures of shifting waters 
and the strain of frost and thaw, something in the heart of this 
stony escarpment gave way. In this sundering a dark crack was 
first opened and it grew through the slow count of years until it 
now yawns wide enough to hold several men abreast. The floor 
here is a slanting plate of fractured stone, lapped by the 
restless waters of the lake beyond. The ceiling tapers into a 
series of irregular gaps and crevices, some twenty feet above.

Deeper Within the Fissure~
   Here the walls of the cave draw together even as the floor 
rises abruptly, finally terminating in a fissure that is no wider 
than a man's hand before it disappears in blackness. The 
surrounding stone is jagged, evidence of violent fractures in the 
hillside rather than the slow, inexorable work of passing waters. 
The cave opens to the west as the defile becomes much broader and 
the sound of lapping waters comes from that direction as well.

A Hedged, Spacious Orchard~
   Surrounded by eight foot walls of pruned lilac bushes with 
entrance allowed by a tall cast-iron gate of the same height, 
this spacious section of land has been worked into a large 
orchard of various trees, bushes, and plant beds. The walls 
provide a privacy to this section of land, though barren of 
flowers, the slender branches still bolster small green leaves 
throughout the milder seasons. A slender, dirt path snakes 
through the field up to the large rows of ongoing trees. 
Throughout the orchard, the pink, purple, and white blossoms of 
the plants have rained about the ground around their shrubs, 
lasting there on the ground into the early days of winter before 
withering entirely or succumbing to the elements. In the 
southwest section of the field, built just near the lilac shrubs 
there is a secluded grey-blue cobblestone patio, flower beds with 
long-stemmed plants with tight bulbs have been planted.

darker clothing of civilians passing to and fro. The large stone 
statue of a man on horseback, clad in platemail, stands defiantly 
facing eastwards towards the city gates. 
   The sound of the city is easily heard here. The bartering of 
traders and their potential buyers during the day, and the laugh 
and song of the plaza's two main taverns in the evening and late 
into the night.

dominated by a solid desk, and illuminated by day with a wide 
window on the eastern wall. The floor is made of solid stone and 
the walls are comprised of the same solid blocks like the rest of

noise is kept to a minimum, those coming and going into the 
office clearly concerned with showing their best behavior in 
light of obtaining a successful business. A massive, detailed 
map of Gondor and the surrounding areas has been hung in the 
north wall, crisscrossed by many marking, tacked notes and 
annotations, apparently the principal reference of demand and 
supply for the clerks.

Ancient Stairway Ascending Mindolluin's Flanks~
   Cut behind an outjutting pillar of rock clinging onto the vast 
shoulders of the easternmost flanks of the White Mountains, huge 
steps have been cut into the bare rock. As wide as a carriage 
and tall enough to tire even the most practised climber, they 
wind up and up above, always keeping behind the crag and out of 
sight of the Pelennor. Moss and damp lichen cling to the steps, 
making progress dangerous and precarious. When the rain falls 
here it channels down in large gullies of streaming, drenching 
and freezing water.

Ancient Steps High Above the Pelennor~
   Great sections of rock have been cut out expertly to form 
these huge steps climbing behind pillars and crags of striated 
and streaked grey rocks. Below, a channel of rock can be spied 
with the stairway leading down steeply and treacherously. Above, 
the steps climb further into a narrowing funnel of Mindolluin's 
stretching arms. 
   No view of the Pelennor can be seen as the rocks begin to pack 
in tightly around here.

Under a Jutting Canopy of Granite~
   Ancient rock steps reach the top of their climb here, a 
widening flat platform offering some solace to those who have 
dared the ascent or prepare to risk the fall below as the huge 
slabs lead precariously steeply down behind a screen of rocky 
chimneys and crags. A rusty gate betrays no markings or keyholes 
in the northern arch pressed down by a large overhang of granite 
blocking all views of the Pelennor. 
   The rains and winds at times in this high place can be truly 
biting, whistling in under the natural roof, through the gate and 
up from the shaft the steps climb.

A Cowered Rock Alcove Near to a Clearing~
   Bent against the forces of wind, snow and the mountain itself, 
this small somewhat sheltered, outcrop ducks beneath a granite 
arm pointing southwards. A rusting gate of criss-crossing 
twisted iron creaks against the wind on plain hinges and no sign 
of a lock can be seen. Beyond it to the south is a darkening and 
windy stone platform. Meanwhile, staring northwards, the small 
opening here leads down a short trail that twists out of sight, 
but seems to gain access to a large clearing.

Within an Ancient Dusty Vault~
   Hewn from the stony flank of Mindolluin, the space beyond the 
ancient, stone portals opens into a large, symmetrical vault. 
The floor here is littered with stones of all sizes - some 
stacked, others scattered. At about the height of a tall man's 
shoulder, a slender, horizontal band of silver, rendered almost 
black with age, has been carefully inlaid in the stone of the 
walls. The band makes a single, complete circuit of the chamber, 
though where it runs across the back of the stone doors it has 
been broken by their movement.

A Large Bunkhouse~
This bunkhouse is built of good, solid logs, sanded down and
stuck together with a sap-like substance to keep out the harsh
elements. Large windows with heavy, latched shutters afford a
view of the gardens outside, and the greenhouse off to the north.
The smooth wooden planks of the floor are left bare, while a large
fireplace keeps this large room, and its residents, warm on cold
nights.
   The southern wall appears to be newer, and looks to have been
built with lumber planks, not logs, the color and odor fresher and
the craftsmanship seems to be lacking slightly compared to the
other walls in the room.

A Small Garden Before A Bunkhouse~
   The path leading of the central farmyard cuts directly west, 
right up to the door of a large, log bunkhouse. On either side 
of the path is a beautiful, serene garden, composed of herbs and 
flowers of varying natures and color, all well tended and adding 
a heady, herbal aroma to the area. Another path leads off the 
main one, heading south towards a small, grassy hillock.

The Site of a Future Orchard Atop a Small Hill~
   This hillock, though relatively small, is nonetheless 
noticeable in the normally flat Pelennor Fields. Like the rest 
of the area of Thornhill Farm, it is enclosed in the fence that 
surrounds the farm, yet it is noticeably quiet, unused. The 
grass that covers it is bright green, however, and the dirt 
underneath firm yet rich, making this the perfect future site for 
an orchard. Already, some saplings have been planted, and with 
time, this orchard will be beautiful indeed. 

Situated in the middle of the orchard is a small cottage.

A Dusty Barnyard~
   This small barnyard, worn down to a dusty mix of dirt and 
gravel by the constant tread of feet and hooves, is situated 
before a pinewood barn that rises above the nearby farmhouse by 
almost twice the house's height. Two large doors in the front 
allow access into the building, while to the west a path leads to 
the central farmyard and the other farm structures. To the 
south, several fields are seen. On the eastern edge of the 
barnyard, a couple chicken coops have been set up, hens clucking 
about and scrabbling for seed nearly every hour of the day, a 
path cutting between them towards another yard with several more 
coops.

A Dusty Flour Mill~
   Oval in shape, the most immediate thing anyone would take note 
of upon entering this room, would be the amount of fine white 
dust that floats around, covering almost every surface. 
Disappearing through a hole in the roof is a long wooden shaft, 
which turns when the mill is in operation, grinding wheat which 
is placed into a hopper on the floor above. 
   The room is dimly lit, most of the daytime light coming 
through the small, dust covered windows, casting bolts of light 
through the room when the sun is at its brightest. A heavy-oak 
door to the south, leads back out into the surrounding fields.

A Storage Cellar Beneath the Floor~
   The walls of this circular room are lined with slightly 
bevelled blocks of grey stone. The floor has been done with the 
same type of stonework as the walls, but is uneven. Several 
stones stick up slightly from the floor and could easily trip the 
unwary. The room would cause most men of average height to 
stoop.

A Sweltering Bloomery~
   The sweltering heat inside this bloomery comes from the large 
device, set against the northern wall of the room. The room is 
stuffy, making it rather uncomfortable for those who are not used 
to working in such conditions. Smoothed, bevelled brick make up 
the soot covered walls, a set of pipes leading from the outside 
at one point, delivering air to the furnace. A mix of tools and 
other and items to aide people working here, lie close to the 
furnace or sit in a rack on the wall. 
   Activity within the bloomery is almost guaranteed at any hour 
of the day or night.

A Stuffy Bloomery~
   The air of this circular room is stuffy and dry. Brick walls, 
covered in black soot, bear no windows to look through and would 
be dark if it weren't for the lanterns and the faint glow of the 
furnace on the north side of the room. Ventilation comes from 
the doorways and some small, chimney-like holes in the roof. 
   A set of numerous pipes lead from the eastern wall and round 
the room to the furnace.

An Open Room of a Farmhouse~
   The overwhelming scent of pine betrays just how new this 
central room of the farmhouse is. In contrast to the newly 
finished walls on the west and east, the rooms to the north and 
south appear to be much older. Adorned on the western wall is a 
simple window looking out into the backyard. A pair of heavily 
reinforced oak door lies on the west with heavy metal bands 
securing the western door. To the north and south smaller pine 
doors lead further into the house.

The Common Room Of A Farmhouse~
   The interior of the house appears to be of pine. On the 
northwest side of this room a staircase rises through the ceiling 
with a regular door at the top of the stairs. During the day, 
light streams through a pair of windows on the eastern wall, 
accentuating the nicely-finished wood-planked floor of the room. 
The walls have been white-washed, though some of its age still 
shows through. Doors are set in all four walls, the east one 
flanked by windows. The room itself is spacious, filled with all 
the amenities that a good cook would require. Wooden pegs are 
attached to the wall in a row near the eastern door.

stained bringing out the rich grain of the wood. The walls 
themselves have been painted a pale gold color, which in the 
evening sun reflects its colors around the interior of the room 
warmly. An orange-red cherrywood trim has been nailed to the 
corner posts as well as running along the walls at about waist 
height. Great detail appears to have been put into the carving 
of an interwoven vine and rosebud pattern on this cherrywood 
trim. There is a single window on the east wall hung with 
sea-green linen drapes.

Pine wood planks secured to the support beams by nails stand

In the northeastern corner of the room is a pull cord attatched 
to a plank of wood with a lock installed into the solid board at 
the edge keeping the cord from pulling down to revealing the 
ladder when it is locked. The edges of the trap door in the 
ceiling is well concealed by the irregular pattern the wood has

overlooking the front door and gate onto the farm.

A Dusty Path Between A Field, A Large Barn, And A Farmhouse~
   This dirt path leads past a small chicken coop. West of the 
coop, the path turns north before a large barn toward a 
fenced-off field. To the east stands the barn, of fairly recent 
construction by the look of it. To the west, the path continues 
on toward a house. Directly to the northwest is a good sized 
house while the path continues southeast toward a gate. The 
house appears a bit weathered by the elements, the horizontal 
wood panelling bearing numerous cracks and chinks. A pair of 
chipped shutters cover its small window.

A Large Barn~
This structure is constructed of wooden planks. Built 
recently, the pine wood still looks new and unweathered. The 
floor is made of packed dirt and the building is large 
enough to shelter a decent number of livestock. There are
two windows, one to either side of the door on the north
wall leading out into the pasture. Lined along the southern 
wall are eight stalls of decent size to house something as
large as a warhorse. Just inside the western door is a peg
attached to one of the beams.

A Large, Fenced Off Field, North of a Barn~
   A worn dirt path to the west leads to this field and a door 
from the barn to the south also grants access to this pasture. 
The field stretches northward, from the walls of the barn to the 
south, and it is hemmed in on all sides by a picket fence made 
from long, wooden planks of wood which are lined up vertically. 
The grass in this field is reasonably short, though it is not 
even, in some places the mud is visible, while in others the 
grass can grow to shin height. A small pen occupied by several 
goats, constructed roughly of pine wood, is nestled among the 
vegetation in the southeastern corner of the pasture which leaves 
plenty of room for larger animals to graze in the rest of the 
pasture.

A Plot of Land~
   A picket wood fence surrounds the perimeter of this land, 
appearing to be roughly an acre or three in size. The land looks 
to have been worked in the past though some shrubs and weeds can 
be seen along the edge of the fenceline. A small path leads up 
to the south side of the fields. To the west sits a house and to 
the south is a small barn. Settled between the house and a 
decent sized shed is a small smokehouse. On to the east is a 
pasture, separated from the fields by the fence and a gate.

A Moderately Sized Shed~
   Crafted for the security from the elements, the pine wood 
planks that make up the walls and ceiling of this building are 
sturdy and sealing out the weather with their close proximity to 
eachother. Though obviously not made to be lived in, this 
moderately space building is large enough to store a decent 
amount of produce. To the left of the door on the southern wall 
is a small window, providing enough light to see during the 
daytime. The walls are lined with shelves, cabinets and bins for 
holding a wide array of items.

A Small Wooden Smokehouse~
   The inside of this slightly cramped smokehouse has a permanent 
smell of burnt wood and various meats. The floor is little more 
than hard packed dirt, making a narrow path through the center of 
the smokehouse. Either side of the path have been constructed 
racks to lay meat upon, with space underneath to start the fires. 
The ceiling is filled with many hooks from which the meat can be 
hung from. A small window above the door lets light in during 
the day.

An Attic~
   This small attic is a bit cramped, in part due to its size but 
mainly on account of the sloping walls which are actually the 
steep roof of the house. Made from large timbers, the rafters 
are set at a high-degree angle and although they appear old, they 
nevertheless seem very sturdy. In contrast to the aged look of 
the roof, the floor appears new. The pine planks of its 
construction are well-fitted and the floor appears quite capable 
of holding a signficant amount of weight. In the northeast 
corner of the room is a doorway; just behind it a staircase 
descends. The walls of the room are white-washed and unlike any 
other room in this house, there is no window to see out through.

Before the Gate of the Farm~
   A path leads through some fields toward a small farmyard 
surrounded by several buildings. A fence surrounds the farmyard 
and the path leads up to a gate in it. Beyond the fence, a 
modest house lies to the west, a large barn to the east, and a 
field some ways to the north. To the south, the path continues 
toward the surrounding fields. A small iron bell hangs from a 
fence pole near the gate.

In the Thick Birch Forest, South of a River~
   Sounding quietly in the midst of the trees and underbrush are 
the quiet movements and chattering of forest life. These sounds 
can be heard coming from all around. The noise of birds sounding 
from the thick canopy that looms over head, and the soft rustle 
of movement in the underbrush. 
   To the north of this part of the forest, a river ceases the 
growth of the birch trees.

Green Field Cottage~
   A small dirt path wends its way through the encroaching 
bracken towards a log hunting cabin, set just inside the 
tree-line of the nearby woods to the west. Birch trees have been 
cut down to make space for the cabin, and create a sort of 
makeshift barrier around the small space of land given to whoever 
owns it. The ground all about the cabin hasn't been given much 
thought, however. The forest, attempting to claim back the cabin 
on all sides, has already made a good effort and would take quite 
a bit of work to clear away for other uses. 
   A dirt trail leads the way back to the birchwoods to the east.

A Small, Cozy Log Room~
   This cozy log cabin's main room is rather simple in its 
construction. The pale pinewood logs, stacked atop one another 
to form the walls have been left bare, and sealed with a tar-like 
substance. However, the floor has been laid with planks of 
birch, varnished and polished to prevent splintering. When left 
unattended, this cabin tends to be rather cool. Though, this is 
remedied quickly by the red brick fireplace set against the 
western wall. 
   A heavy-pine door leads the way out into the birch wood to the 
east, whilst to the north, a pine door opens up into the kitchen. 
In the corner of the room, a simple ladder leads up to a 
trapdoor.

the shade of the dense canopy. The birch trees of this area are 
covered in a smooth, grey bark.

Within a Shady Birchwood Forest~
   Here on the fertile Anorien soil grows the mighty trees of the 
Great Birch Forest. The smooth, grey-barked trees form a dense 
woods with a thick canopy. The lesser trees of this area 
struggle to survive as their light is taken by the bigger, older 
trees that reach high above, to the canopy of the woods.

Within a Dense Forest in the Lands of Anorien~
   High overhead the thick boughs and smaller branches weave 
together to form the canopy that blots out the majority of the 
sun's light in this area of Anorien. The fertile lands provide a 
great soil for the growing of these strong trees which sprout up 
from the ground and reach to lofty heights.

Amidst Aged Birch Wood Trees~
   The tall standing birch trees that have aged and matured 
create a blanket of shadow which keeps this area always protected 
from the glare of the sun, yet it causes the undergrowth and 
saplings of this area to struggle merely for survival due to the 
constant fight in order to receive sufficient light.

A Stand of Mature Birch Trees~
   Here, the strong birch trees push upward from the ground until 
their boughs reach high up and weave together to form a thick, 
leafy canopy. From this canopy, the songs of many birds can be 
heard filtering down to the ground where the sounds of rustling 
and movement rise from the underbrush to meet the chorus of the 
birds with their own cacophony of sound.

In the Dense Birchwood Forest~
   Tall trees stand all about this area, the mighty birches 
reaching up to lofty heights here as their boughs finally come to 
weave together high overhead to form a thick canopy of limbs and 
leaves. The undergrowth here struggles as a result, unable to 
get sufficient light.

A Small Clearing in the Birch Wood~
   Here, the tall and mighty birch trees are absent, but their 
stumps yet remain. This area bears all the evidence of having 
been cleared by the efforts of the axe. Now, small saplings 
begin to try and replace their fallen cousins, attempting to 
reach for the light that is so scarce in other areas of the 
forest.

Nigh to a Clearing in the Woods~
   In this cool, shady section of the forest, the light of the 
clearing to the east of this place stands out radiantly by 
contrast. The strong birch trees of this area create the blanket 
canopy which smothers much of the undergrowth, while to the east 
that blanket disappears.
