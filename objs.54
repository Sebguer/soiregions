cleared to allow the transport of up to a score of armored men 
standing shoulder to shoulder. The railing is formed of 
waist-high posts with a single rope run through holes bored 
through the tops. There is a short bowsprit to allow a small 
jib. A long steering oar at the stern is manned by the master, 
and there are two sailors to handle the lines and sail. The ship 
is old and seems oft-patched, though she is lovingly maintained. 
Her bow has been carved with some ornamentation, though not much, 
leaves and vines curling about her painted-on name. She proudly 
flies the White Tree of Gondor at the top of her mast, and a 
pennant below bearing the heraldry of Lord Eradan.

a nearly opaque, gleaming white silk veil~
A gleaming white silk veil has been left here.~
   Made from the thickest, gleaming white silk this exquisite 
veil is almost opaque and allows just a hint of the wearers 
features to show even from close up. Falling from the crown 
down, the silk is wrapped around a silvery, velvet band that 
clasps to the back of the head with a small silver loop. The 
band is adorned with threads of the thinnest, woven into each one 
another to form a decorative pattern over the hair.

a beaded gown of exquisite gleaming white silk~
A beaded gown of gleaming white silk has been left here.~
   Flowing skirts of thick silk fall lavishly from the trim 
waistline of this exquisite, gleaming white dress, lightly 
brushing over the ground. The furling layers of silk are lightly 
parted and exquisitely draped at the front of the skirts to 
reveal the subtle glisten of silvery satin underneath. 
Scintillating, snow-white beads form subtle patterns upon the 
satin, curling into waves and spirals that tumble around myriads 
of minute, well-placed shells, just as pale in colour. The 
bodice extends into an elegant V-shaped neckline that serves to 
emphasize the neck area. Encrusted around the collar are small 
pearly-white beads, the fabric underneath low enough to reveal 
the wearer's collarbone before rising as it heads around the 
neck. Drawn taught with velvet bands above the elbows, the 
sleeves flair out beyond swirling around the hands of the wearer 
with even the most minute movement. This style of the elegant 
dress is cut close to the rib cage but drapes out along the body 
in a slightly flared A shape skirt, it creates a smooth, clean 
line.

A delicately embroidered dark red silk waist cincher is here.~
   This wide belt of dark red silk consists of four panels and 
laces closed on both sides. The edges, top and bottom have been 
trimmed with a black silk cord. Each panel of smooth lustrous 
silk has been made of several layers of material shaped with 
stiff boning. A matching thread has been used to impart a 
delicate design of peacock feathers throughout the garment. 
Silken cord laced through silver grommets allows one to tighten 
the garment to create a slimming affect, accentuating the wearers 
hips.

A crude scalemail vest of darkened iron lies here.~
   The dark iron scales of this vest have been mismatched onto 
the leather that forms its vest. Some are thick and hearty 
scales, while others are thin, cracked or broken. The only thing 
they seem to have in common is that they are all scarred by 
battle. The iron itself is darkened either through grime, flame 
or blood, and each version of the darkening is present on the 
vest. The leather underneath the scales is stiff and hard, 
further preventing ease of movement, but adding to its defensive 
properties.

A crude scalemail gorget of darkened iron lies here.~
   This gorget's iron scales are dark, sharp and often 
mismatched. They bear many different wounds of battle, and 
appear to have been scavenged together haphazardly. Their most 
common feature is the dark coloration, though its source is not 
readily apparent. Nor is whether or not the coloration was 
intentional.

However, despite its deformities, the helm still looks sturdy and 
workable. The helm covers the wearer's face for added 
protection, leaving small slits for the eyes to see out of, and a 
worn grate over the mouth for ease of breath during heated 
combat.

   This longsword is old and worn, rust tainting its blade where 
it can get past the darkened iron. The source of the iron's 
coloring is unknown, be it blood, fire or craft, however it is 
persistant, even past the nicks in the blade itself. The blade 
is single edged, with a faint curve away from the edged side. 
The old wooden hilt is wrapped in decaying leather cord, ending 
in a similarly blackened iron pommel.

nose is spattered with golden freckles that spread to under her 
wide eyes. Dark moss green in color, they hold hints of gray

riotous curls that tangle all around her face in little ringlets, 
picking up hints of gold in the light.

A thick woolen cloak dyed leaf green is here.~
   Sewn from thick wool, this cloak was designed to match the 
colors of a woodland surrounding. It's billowing cloth has been 
waterproofed with pine-tar on the outside, which also neutralizes 
the smell of its wearer, preventing him from being hunted by 
animals that hunt by smell. The inside of the cloak is artfully 
embroidered with the symbol of crossed swords between stars - the 
heraldry of Dalamir, Lord of the Cross-Roads. Despite very muted 
colors being used in the embroidering, there is an exceptional 
level of detail in the crossed swords, right down to their 
stylized hilts.

   Obviously of skilled craftsmanship, this hauberk of fine steel

a few straps down either side of the torso. On the left breast, 
embossed and dyed with great skill is a pair of crossed swords

mottled forest-green leather. The leather is hardened around the 
upper arm and forearm, to provide increased protection, and 
supple about the shoulders, elbows and wrists to allow for 
freedom of movement. Stamped into the bottom of the forearm of 
each sleeve is an uncolored pair of crossed swords set between

wrapped about the collar, preventing any glint or glare, and 
dampening any sound from the chain. On the left side of the 
throat, is a tiny, uncolored but exquisitely stamped 
representation of a pair of crossed swords between stars. On the 
right, stamped perhaps even more masterfully and this time dyed 
with a muted white is an artful rendition of the White Tree of

Around the joints, the hips, knees and ankles, the leather is

around the thighs and calves, the leather is hardened to increase 
its protection. Various dark leather straps allow the hardened 
leather to be pulled tighter about the wearer's legs to secure 
the leggings in place.

A heavily-worn leather-bound tome lies here.~
The leather covers of this book are a time-bleached sandy-brown
with darker strips placed an inch away from the top and bottom
of the tome, then stretching from one cover to the other. The
leather is dried out with age, with deep cracks reaching from
one the spine out, and spider-webbing across the leather. The
pages of the tome are preserved slightly better between the
covers, but show age as well. Their edges are worn and frail,
ready to break or tear, and they hold a sense of rigidity.
Should one open the book, and leaf through, the pages would
not bend easily over each other, but would lie flat, devoid
of moisture and flexibility.

An ornately-carved, slender-shafted, steel headed spear lies here.~
   This spear is around four and a half feet long and is meant to 
be wielded in one hand. The shaft is slender, allowing it to be 
used not only in combat but as a throwing weapon as well. The 
cedar wood of the shaft has been covered all along its length in 
rather ornate carvings of various animals ranging from eagles 
with wings spread wide to giant bears and even mystical creatures 
such as a large-fanged wyrm, each of the carvings darkened to 
bring out the detail, the indentations burned with precision. 
Mounted atop the spear is a slender, steel head that has been 
molded in the shape of a leaf, the tip razor sharp. Fresh wood 
shows near the base of the spear-head, and the lashings are new 
leather, hinting that this may not be the original head.

crossguard at one end, and a heavy pommel at the other. The hilt 
easily accommodates two hands, but the weight allows it to be 
used successfully with just one.

   Austere in the extreme this small teacup appears to have been 
forged with low quality ceramics by hands concerned more with 
utility than artistry. Holding little worth or quality it

a bronze statue~
A bronze statue has been carefully set among the stones here.~
   This small statue was rendered with immaculate detail, 
depicting a man standing along side a small cart, filled with 
farming tools. The man, quite skinny looking, wears corboulli 
armor and has a longsword girt by his side. He carries a bag of 
seeds in one hand, and a rabbit pelt in the other. The artist 
has rendered a very lifelike image of a huntsman and farmer, with 
loving artistry.

#2A rough-hewn, hastily constructed stockade#0 stands here.~
   Constructed of rough hewn timbers, and apparently hastily 
constructed, this stockade is none the less an imposing structure 
which appears quite defensible. The bottom floor is comprised of 
hardwood logs rising from the ground. Their pointed ends 
reaching several meters the sky. From within two fortified 
platforms can easily be discerned, the occupants of which are 
protected by log walls of similar construction though even at a 
distance several archer slits can be detected. A single 
reinforced gate serves as both entrance and egress.

a formidable wooden catapult~
A formidable catapult constructed of wood and sinew sits here.~
   This machine of war is no laughing matter, and even to the 
untrained eye, it has clearly been skillfully crafted by a master 
of the arts of war. The large firing arm is cranked by means of 
a winded, thick cord of sinew, the tensile strength of that 
material supplying the punch when the payload is released via the 
arm snapping forward. At the terminal end of the arm lays the 
basket, primed for loading with whatever the projectile the 
situation calls for.

well-formed legs lead down to two tiny feet with five perfect

An enormous, fine wool tapestry is here.~
   This tapestry is a prodigious work, sized for hanging in a 
large Hall. The team of artisans who created it used wool dyed 
in a variety of bright colors. There are no unusual hues, just 
blues and whites, and greys and greens, and other colors found in 
nature. Yet the work is masterful, the scene stunning. The 
background is beautiful, bright sky with perfect wisps of cloud 
and elegant, tall trees reaching skyward, some in pale pink 
flower. In the foreground is a grass covered mound laced with 
small white flowers, a woman rests upon a stone set at its crest. 
She is looking to her feet, where a roundshield patterned in 
green has been placed alongside a helm of silver and gold. In 
her lap, a spear with a rusting tip lies, grasped loosely in her 
fingers. Long golden hair cascades over bare shoulders, offset 
by a gown of the finest ivory. Her cloak of gold with a lining 
matched to her gown has been cast unnoticed by her side.

his skin. His pudgy cheeks are rosy and frame a small pink mouth

bright sapphire eyes, nearly too large for his face, sit beneath 
dark lashes. He is rather large for a baby of his age, long of

so darkly black that light seems to disappear. There is no leafy

sickening heartiness that lends malice to the bush. Sharp spikes 
spanning the size of a fingernail to the length of a man's arm 
jut out from the vines which worm around each other, the very 
darkness making them appear to writhe and move except when you 
look directly upon them. Knotted black roots gnarl up out of the

sprawling wall that has grown to nearly six feet in height and 
sprawling a vast distance in width. Passage around it seems 
nearly impossible, thanks to the vicious thorns that spike out at 
angles. The bark is slick and so darkly black that light seems 
to disappear. There is no leafy growth nor flowers upon this 
vine, but it seems to live with a sickening heartiness that lends 
malice to the bush. Sharp spikes spanning the size of a 
fingernail to the length of a man's arm jut out from the vines 
which worm around each other, the very darkness making them 
appear to writhe and move except when you look directly upon 
them. Knotted black roots gnarl up out of the ground to trip the 
unwary and leech further life from the ground.

A thornbush made of twining black vines gives off a dark air of malevolence.~
   Thick black vines twine around each other in a twisting 
sprawling mass from which vicious thorns spike out at angles. 
The bark is slick and so darkly black that light seems to 
disappear. There is no leafy growth nor flowers upon this vine, 
but it seems to live with a sickening heartiness that lends

a large tree with viscous fungus~
A large tree grows here with a viscous fungus and somewhat rotting bark about its base.~
   Healthsome, green leaves sprout from the limbs of this large 
tree, fanning out against the sky. Despite its generous size and 
the hale wooden husk coating most of its length, the bottom of 
the tree, and especially some of its more exposed roots, tells an 
entirely different story. A muculent, putrid-smelling fungus the 
colour of egg yolk clings to dark, rotting, and in some places 
dead-looking bark. Even the soil at the base of this impressive 
specimine of plantlife appears somewhat befouled, and the odor of 
decay and something far more offensive to the senses clings to 
the very air around it.

   Using the terrain to its fullest extent, two score figures in 
White Tree marked green cloaks are grouped silently about the 
area. In fours and fives, the figures remain hidden and silent, 
prepared to move at a moment's notice. A mixture of short and 
longbows are carried, with each archer bearing a full quiver.

   Apparently expecting to move soon, this group of heavily 
armoured soldiers remain in a tight formation. Their armour and 
indeed any metal objects they carry have been dulled, and they 
hold their shields with grim determination. Leading them is a 
bannerman carrying the Standard of the White Tree.

   Standing in a somewhat relaxed formation, these heavily 
armoured individuals are the elite of the Pel Dagor. Steel plate 
and chain have been donned, and they are cloaked by fine black 
wool, each bearing the White Tree. Great tower shields are held 
by each of the soldiers, and shoulder sheaths hold long swords. 
A finely armoured individual has been chosen to carry the 
standard, and the White Tree is held high above the heads of the 
men.

   Whether at a slow canter or a dead halt, the formation of 
these Pel Ecthel remains in good order. Knights of Gondor all, 
they are the best that their country can offer. Each is clad in 
steel plate, with a sword at their sides and a spear in hand. 
Their helms are fully enclosed, sealing these elite veterans from

Hidden throughout the area in pairs are forty earthen-brown cloaked figures. They are masterfully obscured from view, shielded from all but the keenest eye.~
   Silent and mobile, these Rangers of Ithilien are some of the 
deadliest Men to walk the region. Hidden perfectly from view, 
only the faintest evidence of their presence is visible. They 
are here in pairs, numbering nearly two score. No sound is made 
by any of them, and communication is done through obscure 
gestures and animal calls.

   This beautifully wrought flask has been lovingly crafted of 
silvered steel, flawless in design and sturdy in structure. A 
lid of the same material has been cleverly hinged to the top of 
the flask to snap over its round mouth, which leads to the 
vessel's smooth shoulders, slightly curved in a convex fashion, 
with an unobtrusive metallic half-loop upon its back, strong 
enough to clip onto a belt at the hip. Upon the front is etched, 
with meticulous attention to detail, a shield in relief, with the 
image of the White Tree of Gondor emblazoned upon its centre. 
Around this shield is the shape of a full moon.
