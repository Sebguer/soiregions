A black and grey flag, bearing a shield within a moon, hangs proudly from a pole mounted to the wall here.~
This large flag has a design of a black shield contained 
within a grey moon and is mounted to a large iron pole, which
is itself attached to a wall with large brackets. The flag
flaps proudly in the wind and even on still days the close
embroidery of silk and cotton combine to give this banner a
valorous gleam.

table skull-based round wooden GOTHAKRA WOOD~
a skull-based, round wooden table~
A wooden table stands here, displaying a skull mosaic at its top.~
   Standing upon a trio of wood-crafted claws, which are perched 
atop a set of very real humanoid skulls, this table displays a 
very commanding presence. Excluding the skulls at its base, this 
table is extensively crafted out of sturdy oak wood, 
fire-hardened, and shined to give it a sturdy look. Circling the 
banister which arches from the base of the table, and works 
upward to the top are a series of intricate depictions of battled 
between men, beasts, and orc, all displaying gruesome detail, and 
accurately depicting carnage of the battlefield. Topping this 
table is a broad skull mosaic, which appeared to be white bone 
wedged into the wood, and glazed over with a sealant to preserve 
the work.

a handful of crudely-carved knuckle bones~
A handful of knuckle bones lie here, carved crudely.~
   Five small knuckle-bones, each carved and chipped into a rough 
square, lie here. Each flat surface has been carved with a 
different symbol so that when the bones are thrown, they will 
each land with a carving facing upward. The runes show on the 
bone are a skull, a sun, a moon, a sword, and an eye.
