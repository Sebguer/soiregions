apiary empty clay CERAMIC~
an empty clay apiary~
An empty clay apiary stands here, waiting for bees.~
   Made of what looks like pale clay, these dome-shaped beehives 
have numerous hole-shaped entranceways in them, but no bees are 
present yet. Each apiary has a hinged lid, and inside are 
removable slats built to accomodate honeycombs. The apiary is 
safe to move now, but will probably become otherwise once a 
bee-swarm has found it.

blanket pile threadbare $drabcolor cotton TEXTILE~
a threadbare, $drabcolor cotton blanket~
A pile of threadbare, $drabcolor cotton lies here.~
   Large enough to cover a typically-framed human from head to toe,
this blanket is little more than a thin rectangle of cotton. A row
of dark stitches around the edge prevents the piece from coming
completely unraveled, despite intermittent fraying and tearing. 
The $drabcolor dye may once have been even, but stains and faded
splotches have long since ruined the effect.

a plain leather collar~
A plain leather collar has been left here.~
   This is a simple, dark-brown leather strip with holes punched
in one end, and a buckle set into the other so it can be adjusted
to fit all but the very smallest or largest necks. It is not
adorned at all, and is rather plain-looking.

yet sturdy. It falls in folds to the wearers ankles with ample

A $color linen headband lies here on the ground.~
   Cut and fashioned from plain linen, this headband is functional as 
well as decorative. It has been dyed $color and its cut is wider in
the middle of its length, narrowing towards the ends. It's meant to
be just tied in back when worn, to hold back the hair and keep it
out of the wearer's eyes.

A doghouse is set off to the side.~
   This wooden doghouse is made for an average-sized to large
dog. Boards are nailed together to make a structure that provides
basic shelter for anything small enough to fit inside it. Though
very simply made, it's of good workmanship, with fitted boards and
a basic floor, all of it sanded smooth.

A pet house sized for a small animal is set here.~
   This tiny structure is far too small for anything larger than
a cat or perhaps a bird.  Boards have been loosely nailed together
to make a structure that could provide shelter for something small 
enough to fit inside it.  Though it appears to have been hastily built 
with little attention to detail it still looks sturdy enough. No
floor is attached to the walls of it, as if for easy cleaning.

A fine, ruby-red glass vase is set here.~
   Made of intensely ruby-red glass, this vase is large enough
to handle a bouquet of flowers. The glass is cunningly worked
and blown with fluted edges that look like a flower's petals.
The vase sits on short stem, its base shaped like a flower as
well. It's an elegant, highly stylized piece.

The mostly-complete skeleton of a fish is lying here.~

large specimen. The skull, measuring at least a handspan, is 
pale and brittle, with many cracks running through it. The 
narrow jaws still contain rows of tiny teeth, and the empty eye 
sockets stare lifelessly at nothing. Most of its ribs are also 
still attached to the spine, though a few seem to be missing. 
The flesh and scales have long-since rotted away, leaving just 
this stark white skeleton, mostly-complete despite some broken 
pieces.

different kinds, it is difficult to tell, as there aren't any 
skulls among them, just a few pale and broken pieces.

an open-bottomed ash barrel~
An open-bottomed ash barrel stands on legs, a few feet off the ground.~
   This is a barrel of average size which has been modified for 
use as an ash barrel. The top and bottom have both been removed, 
allowing liquid to run through freely, while a metal grate rests 
on pegs just up from the bottom, allowing solid material to be 
packed in without falling out. The grate appears to remove 
easily for emptying and cleaning the barrel. Sturdy legs have 
been attached to the bottom of the barrel, leaving about a 
two-foot space, large enough for a basin to slide underneath.

a round neckline with a rich line of fur trimming it's edge. A 
slimilar trimming of fur is found around the ends of the sleeves 
giving an overall feel of warmth and style. The skirt is not 
gathered from the round waistline, but gored, so it flows 
smoothly down over the hips to just past the ankles with enough 
room for it to not drag across the ground, with triangles of 
fabric sewn into each seam to give it fullness. Its buttons are 
of silver, each burnished smooth and fitting perfectly into their 
well-sewn buttonholes. It is a durable, easy to wear garment, 
soft and well-made.

bouquet, their stems starred with tiny white blossoms, and 
threaded with the pale lilac ribbons which bind the flowers.

moons and stars, each little more than an outline, winking in 
silver, contrasting the $color wool beneath.

The vest has no sleeves or sleeve-caps, but its armholes are roomy.
The garment also boasts a hood, deep and unlined, to keep off the

grip, and the blade can cause great damage if thrown correctly, 
yet its size still allows it to be used as a good close quarters

tempered iron sword blade WEAPONCRAFT METAL~
a tempered, iron sword blade~
A tempered iron sword blade has been left here, glinting dully.~
   The base for a more than average sword, this swordblade 
apparently has been worked on the heat of a forge with skill and 
attention, with special concern to the tempering, evident by the 
lack of impurities on the metal, the glinting quality of the 
surface and the lack of hammer marks on the edges and fuller. A 
long tang, set with four drilled holes , permits the solid 
setting of a hilt, once the blade is assembled.

a tempered, iron knife blade~
A tempered, iron knife blade has been abandoned here.~
   Short and solid, the length of this knife blade has been 
worked with more attention than the average. Apparently tempered 
serveral times in the heat of the forge, the blade shows almost 
no mar or mark from the hammer, and is more flexible than 
standard pieces. A tang where two holes have been drilled awaits 
the setting of a hilt.

   Worked on the heat of a forge with skill and attention, this 
two feet blade appears to be a cut above the average, with

seems free of impurities and which glints softly in the light. 
Three holes have been drilled or cast on the thang, allowing the 
firm affixing of a hilt.

An empty arrowhead of clay lies here, on it's side.~
   This arrowhead is large and about the size of an average jar. 
It has been fashioned out of fired clay and left uncolored, the 
arrowhead itself empty as if made to hold something inside. The 
opening of the arrowhead is quite long and half-way down its 
length, it narrows before broadening again. A wide cork fits 
down inside the opening where it narrows, a long, hemp wick poked 
through the middle of the cork. The wick is long enough that it 
dangles into the arrowhead while the other end hangs out quite a 
bit out of the opening of the head.

A hat made of white rabbit fur lies here.~
   Made from soft, white rabbit hide, this linen-lined hat sits 
firmly on the head, covering most of the hair. It is brimless 
and more or less round, coming to a very slight peak not much 
above the top of the head. Sewn carefully to each side of the 
hat's edge above the ears are a pair of soft double-sided fur 
flaps, with a small thong of leather attached to each lower 
section. This allows the flaps to be worn down, covering the 
ears, or raised above the hat's crown.

Delicate silver-embroidered vines creep up from the hem, some 
almost reaching the waist.

gown UNIQUE_PGALVORN elegantly draping $finecolor silk fabric TEXTILE~
an elegantly-draping, $finecolor silk gown~
A gown of $finecolor silk lies here in a heap of fabric.~
   This formal gown has been sewn from heavy-weight silk fabric 
and evenly dyed $finecolor in color. The most noticeable thing 
about this dress is the amount of fabric used in its creation; it 
is loose and carries a lot of drape. This dress lacks a 
well-defined neckline, as it is more akin to a swath of fabric 
draped loosely across the shoulders, the many folds of fabric 
billowing. Despite the looseness, however, it hangs down to no 
obscene level, and is in fact quite modest, showing no cleavage. 
Likewise, the loose, draping fabric of the dress leaves the 
feminine curves more to be implied than explicitly displayed. 
The shoulders of the dress are gathered, and the sleeves flow out 
from them, loosely down to the elbow, but from the elbow they 
flare dramatically to hang more than a foot below the wearer's 
wrist. The skirt is full and long, reaching down to one's feet, 
and is made of many layers, each cut so that the others are 
visible.

plates cover the upper and lower arms, with an elbow cup rivetted 
where they join, and beneath this all is a thin layer of leather 
covering to make for the wearing more comfortable.

a robe of $finecolor silk~
A robe of $finecolor silk lies discarded on the ground.~
This comfortable silken robe is made of lightweight, $finecolor 
fabric. It fits the wearer loosely, open in the front unless 
secured closed with a sash about the waist. The edges of the 
garment have been doubled up a couple of times and sewed 
together, making the hems more durable and resistant to fraying 
and wear. Some simple black embroidery adorns the robe on the 
ends of the sleeves and at the lower hem. This piece of clothing 
is made primarily for lounge wear rather than attire one would 
wear out of the house.

instead of a neck the carving has a short, sturdy screw, which 
gives the impression that this figure either goes attached to

cloak FAILPRODUCE_SNORK poorly ill made bad fitting bear fur hide LEATHER~
an ill-fitting bear hide cloak~
An ill-fitting bear hide cloak lies here in a heap.~
   With poorly sewn seams and mismatched patches of fur this 
cloak leaves much to be aesthetically desired. Despite the lack 
of skill evident in its creation it still looks to be able to 
provide some warmth and a degree of protection from the elements. 
Its uneven hem hangs to the wearer's calves and it ties at the 
throat with short lengths of cord.

A serving of burned root vegetables lie here in a pile.~
   This serving of root vegetables have been cooked far too long 
and burned so black that it is impossible to tell their original 
origin. A terrible smell emits from the blackened crust, and 
they seem edible, but barely.

A pair of herbal-wrapped splints have been abandoned here.~
   Two light but sturdy wooden splints are wrapped carefully in 
fabric with a woven pad of boiled grasses, the wrappings tight

without fear of splinters. The leaf-filled pad ensures comfort 
when tightened, the wrappings stained green by the medicinal 
treatment contained within. Extra fabric is wrapped around the 
outside in a careful weave, able to be tightened or loosened on a 
limb.

A silver ring set with the image of a stag gleams in the light.~
   This silver ring has been mounted with a circular disc bearing 
the image of a Stag. The Stag is shown in profile with a proud 
set of antlers running off the edge of the ring and small nicks 
have been cut into the neck and head indicating a furry surface. 
Where the eye would be a pit has been carved deep into the 
silver, with a small ruby suspended above it. The ruby casts a 
deep red hue into the pit behind it and shines brightly when the 
light hits the ring at the right angle. The saturation of colour 
brings a stark purity to the pale white silver surrounding it.
