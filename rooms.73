Shadow's Room~
   The passage broadens here, Reaching out like gnarled fists 
outcroppings of sandstone jut out from the naturally carved 
walls. The floor is uneven here forming tiny ledges across the 
corridor. The ceiling slants sharply in an opposed angle to the 
floor. The dripping echos in through the eerie silence of the 
caverns.

Before The Gates~
   To the west, the fortified gatehouse rises above the road, its 
iron-strapped wooden gates barring the entry of unwelcome 
visitors. The imposing stone walls are scarred and scratched 
from years of warfare, but altogether remain sturdy. Still, the 
keeps architecture lacks any hint of beauty - marred by the 
strange mixture of Gondorian and Haradaic building styles 
combined into one. To the east, the horizon is dominated by a 
constant line of shadowy black mountains.

A Well Guarded Gatehouse~
   This square shaped gatehouse have been built into the palisade 
walls being about midway through from one side to the other. 
Either side has been barred by large fortified gates which are 
constantly watched by the men stationed inside. A latch has been 
set into the gate to allow the watchmen to peer outside while the 
portcullis has been solidly fortified and placed to serve as a 
secondary defence should the gates be breeched. The ground has 
been laid with cut slabs of stone giving it an orderly and 
disciplined look.

OOC Dispense A Troop Shop~
   This room is considered "Out Of Character", and exists due to 
coded necessity. If you do not have leadership in the Abdul 
Matin or The Silvermoon Dervish clans, please leave immediately, 
or face summary execution. Here, through typing list, you can 
see what troops are availabe for recruitment by Abdul Matin and 
The Silvermoon Dervish. All troops come naked, clanned to Abdul 
Matin and The Silvermoon Dervish as private, and clanned to Tur 
Edendor to avoid being attacked by the archers there. 

Troops can arrive from wherever you wish to roleplay them from; 
any area of the Harad is possible. Any background within reason 
you want to give them for roleplay purposes is welcome. The cash 
payment for troops is considered to be arranging their traveling 
expenses and paying for a life time's supply of NPC food. You 
will be able to name each soldier that you buy; finding an 
Arabian or Egyptian name site will help immensely with this. 


An explanation of the terms; Dervish: Your elite combat troops. 
Excellent fighters and archers. 

Abdul Matin Scouts: Your Scouts. Stealthy, good archers, decent 
fighters.

A Cosy Kitchen~
   This area is very modestly decorated, and seems quite 
pragmatic in design. A fairly low ceiling, with a rather open 
spacing of several nativestone benches topped with marble is 
further evidence of its utilitarian purpose. There is a single 
window that allows the area to ventilate on the western wall, 
most of the light even during the day being provided by small oil 
lamps mounted upon the walls.

A Dank Cell~
   With grimy, dirt covered walls of small stone blocks, this 
room is inhospitable to say the least. Only the barest threads 
of line filter in through the tiny barred window high above, 
which as often as not, lets more cold air and rain in than 
visibility. Rank and putrid, the cell stinks of urine and 
unwashed bodies, doing nothing to make the small, murky pool of 
drinking water in the corner more appetizing.

   Impossible to climb without the aid of a ladder or perhaps 
grappling hook, and a guaranteed quick fall to the ground for 
those who haven't come prepared thusly, the space of air exists 
outside the reinforced and expertly constructed battlement of the 
walled village, offering a somewhat pleasant view of the 
surrounding South Ithilien farmlands.

A Large Training Room~
   A modest sized staircase leads up from this oval shaped room 
to the common room above. The walls have been slightly padded 
along with a small section under the stairwell where weapon racks 
have been set up. This room is large enough to hold a few score 
men at once and can be used for most training exercises, where 
the ground is solid and even. A number of candles and torches 
keep this room alight.

A Disheveled, Padded Room~
   Everything in this room, from the walls to the floor to the 
furniture, seems to have been covered with a soft layer of 
padding as though its occupant might hurt themselves at any given 
moment. A chaotic flutter of papers, tools, and miscellaneous 
materials have been scattered all about as though throw in a mad 
frenzy or a bout of fury. Some broken items lie near the walls, 
having been thrown against it and destroyed.

The Farm~
   A huge landscape stretches out before you on all sides of the 
horizon, the plains around you are surrounded by various crops 
growing in neat rows in all directions. Large silos loom over 
the plains with many shoots and gutters running between them, 
connecting them and giving them means to move the grain and corn 
from inside between each other more easily. The ground beneath 
your feet is scorched and cracked from the sweltering heat of the 
day and from being starved of a refreshing rain. Many animals 
can also be made up in the distance which have been fenced within 
different enclosures to keep them separated. Nearby a large 
farmhouse stands solemnly on its own.

A Hollowed Out Cavern~
   The walls of this cavern appear as though they have been 
crudely worn away, either by time or by a hastier hand. 
Crumbling stone and jagged rocks litter the ground in testament 
to its crumbling state, suggesting a possible weakness in the 
structure, especially around the mouth of the cave. The rocks 
and packed dirt forming the floor are devoid of even a struggling 
weed or mushroom, having been so compacted that any footprints 
left behind would be difficult to trace.

A Dank Cave~
   As the floor of the cave begins to dip slightly here, stagnant 
and shallow puddles of muddy water have formed, constantly fed by 
a slow trickle that slides down the slick walls. The smell of 
damp earth hangs heavy in the air, lending a closed-in feeling. 
Dilapidated wooden beams have begun to sag from under the weight 
of water and saturated dirt.

A Narrow Cave Snaking Northward~
   Narrowing considerably, this long stretch of cave is hewn 
primarily out of rock. Walls smooth and ground stained dark, 
there is a stale, malodorous scent lingering in the air, its 
source not immediately apparent. A long-decayed skeleton has 
been picked clean by time and various small creatures, the bones 
scattered in one rounded corner, not far from their companions. 
And most prominent on the wall, an ambling, brown trail has been 
traced as though words written onto the stone, marked by an old, 
dripping handprint and dipping crookedly from its starting point. 
Its edges have begun to flake away, time having had its way with 
the coherence.

of this cave are damp and crumbling. The ceiling and wall beams 
are rotted and soft. The rubble strewn floor is jagged and 
uneven. The air is damp and foul. A dripping can be heard in 
the distance.

wooden beams now rotting and splintering apart. Puddles of murky 
water seep up from cracks in the rubble strewn floor. The air is

are shured up with rotting beams. The ceiling of the cave is 
colapsed at the rear while the remainder is supported by rotting 
beams. The air is damp and heavy with a musty and acrid stench.

further time or effort have been spent on them. A number of 
tents are instead scattered around which house the many npcs 
ensuring they dont get wet when it rains.

Sharp Turning Street South of a Black Spire of Rock~
   A sharp turn of the stone path leads from south to west 
through this section of Tur Edendor, notably by as the path runs 
further south the denizens seem to be of darker skin, and more 
colourful garb, than the normal dull, rag clothing worn by humans 
in the town. Plain, yet well-built clay-brick housing jars oddly 
with the surrounding rocky bluff, the pale buildings contrasting 
against the dark mountains, the vibrant tarpaulins stretched out 
before the few dwellings here further adding to the oddness. The 
road continues north, south and west through the gate leading out 
of this guarded quarter of Tur Edendor. 
   The silence is loud at this end of the quarter.

Narrow Plateau Ledge Leading Over the Martial Yards~
   The northern side of this narrow ledge is occupied by a row of 
small, squat houses, set with secure shutters and flat roofs that 
house a variety of brown and green plants. Dark-skinned men and 
women, never very many, walk on by, sometimes wandering into the 
heavily carved door on the south side. The painted sign over the 
door depicts a lush scene of palm trees and a large pool of water 
surrouned by sand dunes. Potted palms sit on either side of the 
door.

The "Oasis" Lounge~
   Crowded with luxurious furs, blankets and decoration, this 
large room boasts a series of low tables and cushions, set in a 
semi-circle about a large, darkly-stained stage. A small bar 
curves against the northern wall beside a nondescript doorway and 
a small, ornate statue sits before the western entrance; a 
scantily clad woman pouring water from between carven stone 
hands, the steady stream flowing into the circular pool set 
before her. The air is hazy with many breeds of mixed smoke, 
swirling upwards about a gently spinning chandelier and the 
gentle murmur of conversation is ever-present amongst the many 
diverse patrons. 
   The northern doorway is boarded and nailed securely. The room 
is oddly quiet.

room, from which comes a calming, smoky aroma. There are 
doorways to the east and west of dark, glossy wood, and an 
iron-reinforced door to the north. A painting on the eastern 
wall depicts a tall, mahogany-skinned man wearing a sand-hued 
cloak whipping around his ankles whilst standing amidst a desert 
landscape. An iron staircase spirals up to a second floor door.

smoothed over in particular paths by the frequent comings and 
goings. A large fireplace butts up against one wall, leading 
into a protruding stone chimney to export the smoke. A 
serviceable stove and oven flank one side of the fireplace, 
wooden counters and storage lining the walls around it. An 
extensive pot rack hangs over a serving island in the center of 
the kitchen, within easy reach of the cooking and working spaces.

A Spacious Common Room~
   Formed of gently curving wood, the walls of this room have 
been covered with a simple, yet beautiful mural of a desert 
night, the pale golden stretching along the lower half in obscure 
dunes. The upper half of the walls bears a gradually darkening 
blue tone until it fades again into speckling white starbursts, 
all culminating to a full, round moon on the ceiling, from which 
a hanging brazier casts its light. A star-carved shutter covers 
the window that looks out into the street. Except for one corner 
of the room reserved as the kitchen area, it is devoid of 
clutter, leaving ample of space for movement. 
   A compact, spiraling staircase leads up into the second floor, 
its solid banister painted a dusty, grey-blue to appear like a 
stylized whirlwind. A heavy silk curtain of cerulean blue hangs 
in the eastern doorway. And a wide, arching doorway opens into 
an adjoining workroom to the south.

   Cool, white stone tiles the floor of this square room in an

which form the walls have been generously coated with a dark 
stain, giving it a subtly reddish tint. Small, multi-pointed 
stars speckle high along the northern wall, piercing through the 
wood and to the outside, allowing stars-shaped beams of light in 
during the daylight hours. Several pear-shaped oil lamps have 
been set along the walls to help illuminate the bath and the area 
surrounding it.

An Efficient Workroom~
   The would-be plain walls of this room have been offset by the 
warm tones of yellows and reds, blended horizontally onto the 
wooden panels. Gaily colored rag rugs lay across the stone 
floor, nearly every inch of the floor. Shelves of threads and 
fabrics of all colors line most of the southern wall, built over 
a large workbench. With plenty of room to work and ample storage 
space, this room promises efficiency. 
   Set close to the southeastern corner, a trapdoor leads down 
into a storage cellar. A brightly colored curtain closes off a 
small doorway along the west wall, while a moon-etched door leads 
into a private room.

stone floor is cold but is strewn with colorful rag rugs to add

The walls are painted a rich scarlet, with a tapestry of wild 
horses running across blood-red sand on the southern wall. A 
wide window of glass has been set in the northern wall with 
beaded curtains on either side. The floors are built of 
sandalwood panels, but there is a large scarlet rug with golden 
embroidery set in the middle of the floor. 
   There is a doorway facing the east, with a carving of an 
obsidian snake winding itself around it.

Valley-Like Street Leading Between Two High Rows of Rock By Two Shops.~
   The road here cuts from the south-west to the north-east, 
leading past two ten foot, sheer walls of black rock, pitted with 
many holes and cracks no doubt from the chill wind that always 
seems to blow in the air here. A number of tents, dyed strong 
colours and some decorated with patterns of circles and swirls, 
have been erected against either wall, forcing one to make a 
zig-zagging path between them. The smell of fresh milled lumber 
wafts out through the eastern door of a busy woodshop. Over the 
door to the south hangs a sign shaped as a helmet. At either end 
of the little valley stands a wooden post, at night lit with a 
bright torch. 
   Trash and broken pottery are tossed aside here.

Rock-Carved Street Before a Store Smelling of Flowers~
   The street and cobblestones here have been carved directly in 
to the rock underfoot. A sewage channel has been dug along the 
south-eastern edge of the rockwall, and crude, preliminary 
carvings have been made upon the street surface, too vague to be 
distinguished as anything of note, and ending soon to the east 
and south. A building constructed of black stone and built up 
against the western mountain peak emits a strong floral smell, 
the aroma hanging in the air here even as the cold breezes of Tur 
Edendor stir the beaded curtains in the doorway of the store. A 
sturdy iron gate blocks the way north. 
   A beaded curtain is partialy torn away from its doorway.

Track Weaving Through the Rock~
   A path two people wide zig zags back and forth as it climbs 
from the low martial yards, where the various mercenaries and 
warbands housed in Tur Edendor gather. Orcs and humans can be 
seen sparring and working the forges across the other side of the 
yard, lit by the orange-red glow of the forges at now and 
belching forth clouds of smoke up past the ring of craggy points 
that forms the boundary of the settlement. At the top of the 
trail, two paths branch off down two seperate streets, to the 
west the majority of buildings made of stone, and to the north 
most fashioned from wood.

Entrance To A Small Haradrim Bazaar~
   A foreboding looking stone building lies to the south. Its 
dreary stone is the same color as the bleak mountains that are 
home to Tur Edendor. To the west, the snaking streets of the 
Haradrim Quarter stretch out towards the western city gate and 
marketplace. To the east, a bustling square opens in all 
directions.

The West End of A Small Haradrim Bazaar~
   To the east stretches a small busy market place. Gaily 
colored tents, stalls, and carts clutter the square. Shops dot 
the rock backed walls of the tiny square. Dark-haired vendors 
push brightly painted carts, while others hawk from painted 
stalls. A myriad of scents waft through the air carrying hints 
of the goods available. Swarthy men and women rush towards the 
east where the heart of the square bustles with activity. To the 
west the street snakes through the Harad Quarter of Tur Edendor. 
The market continues to the east, north, and south. 
   A child's doll is tossed carelessly aside in the mud.

square from the south and east. Swarthy vendors, dressed in the 
gaily colored exotic clothing of Haradwaith, push their painted 
carts though the busy square while hawking their wares loudly to 
passersby. The aroma of spices and incense waft from the many 
shops but the strong smell of new leather wafts through the 
curtain to the north. 
   A smashed barrel lays abandoned here.

Its exit leading into the snaking streets of the Harad Quarter of
Tur Edendor. Here, the market is loud with the callings of 
dark-skinned vendors plying their exotic wares. A group of
travelers makes their way through the brightly striped tents, and
the south and west walls of the bazaar are dotted with small
shops. The tiny bazaar continues to the east and north. The 
sign hanging over the southern door boasts a painting of crossed
scimitars.

A spit hugs its sizzling meat and wafts its rich scent through 
the air. Food vendors hawk their wares, adding to the smoky and 
rich smelling ambiance of the busy, little market. Shops with 
brightly beaded doorways line the southern end of the square, and 
the Bazaar continues to the north, east, and west. A scrolled 
wooden sign hanging above the southern door displays a painting 
of ring with a big gem setting.

A Small Haradrim Bazaar West Central~
   This is the heart of the busy little bazaar. Tents and stalls 
of loosely-woven cloth are pitched within close proximity of each 
other, their owners shouting out offers to all who pass by. 
Vendors ply their wares as they haggle and barter with buyers 
dressed in the brightly colored clothing of the Harad. Scents 
and aromas waft in from around the square adding to the exotic 
flavor of the bustling market area. The bazaar continues in all 
directions. 
   A large, noticeable square sits in this part of the bazaar, 
the pavement cleaner than the rest, but speckled with splashes of 
color here and there. An overturned tent, ripped and torn is 
cast aside here.

pickpocket. Brightly garbed vendors within close proximity of

shop lies to the north. Glass trinkets on a string from above 
the shop door tinkle softly on the wind as it gently caresses the 
colorful glass. The bazaar continues to the south, east and

   The sturdy canvas roof and walls of this large tent are 
supported by wooden poles, harboring the edible goods within from 
the ravaging of the elements. Woven straw mats blanket the 
floor, catching spills left by the various dry goods set out on 
display. Baskets, jars, and barrels have been stacked along the 
southern wall, while the looser goods hold to a prominent place 
at the forefront. The constant buzz of customers' voices fills 
the air, broken only occasional shout of a deal well struck or of 
one gone awry.

   A pungent aroma fills the air, wafting from a few large vats 
of basic colored liquids which lends an almost stifling feeling 
to this particular side. Swarthy-skinned merchants assist 
customers with their purchases, haggling over prices and filling 
metal cans from the vats of paint. Splotches of color and 
trailing footprints speckle the wooden deck, evidence of the 
careless handling of paints.

wood. Carefully arranged bottles fill much of the shelf space, 
marking most of the inventory as different colored dyes. A few

A Crate-Filled Center of the Barge~
   Buyers crowd this portion of the barge, either passing through 
or pausing to look over the specific wares. Crates of all 
various sizes have been laid out, forming uneven pathways between 
the merchandise. A barrage of colors fill each wooden bin, 
glinting from the pavilion's lamps. Glass can be heard clinking, 
filling small pouches and bags whenever a deal is struck.

A Broad Tent Displaying Fresh Meat~
   The strong smell of blood and livestock assaults the senses on 
this side of the wide tent, marking the wares before one can even 
look down at the various cuts of meat spread out on display. 
Several layers of thick canvas mats pad the floor, each stained 
with telltale splotches of browns and reds. In the farthest 
corner, a large stone slab has been set up for butchering the 
animals then and there. A few young, dark-skinned children 
circulate among the meat with palm fronds, swatting and shooing 
at flies that have been drawn by the musky smell of livestock.

back into the storefront. All the shelves hold a large selection

Noisy Kitchen~
   This clean, white stone constructed room is of a comfortable 
size, but slightly cramped with the various large pieces of 
furniture and working spaces. Much of one wall is taken up by a 
stepped hearth and cooking area, that scents the air ripely with 
sizzling foods. A stone staircase leads up against the rest of 
the wall to a trap door that is between two of many reinforced 
beams that comprise the whitish wood ceiling. Noise issues forth 
from the far wall opposite the stairs where the pallets and 
belongings of servants are neatly arranged. Shelves line the 
walls above the servant sleeping places and onto the last wall, 
just shy of the door leading to the outer shopfront. Near the 
stairs is an iron-ringed wooden trap door that leads down into a 
cellar.

Airy, Upper Room~
   At the top of a stair, just a trap door away from the hustle 
of a noisy houshold is this quiet, stone constructed room. The 
smooth and even white stones of the walls and the whitish oak of 
the sturdy wooden floorboards give this small, but comfortable 
room a larger appearance. Several large pieces of furniture are 
arranged neatly throughout the whole room, interspersed by rushes 
that scent the room sweetly. A small window with bright red 
shutters lets in air and light, but not much sound from its place 
in the second level wall overlooking the street. A large, 
iron-ringed door is set into the floor planks leading to the room 
below.

large work area has been set up, taking up much of the room. 
Without a source of heat, this cellar is very cold in every 
season. Several shelves and cabinets for storage line two of the 
rough walls as well as hooks hanging down from the ceiling. A 
simple sanded wooden staircase steps upwards to the iron banded 
trapdoor.

long ivory-colored candles. Ebon wood glass display cases are 
placed throughout the room in a strategic manner to better show 
off their wares. The floor is made of solid wood, though it is 
scuffed here and there from a careless foot.

broke up by richly stained timbers that are adorned with polished

A Stone Walled Brewery~
   Smooth grey stone form the tall walls of this expansive room. 
The floors are a darker stone, left rough but tightly jointed in 
a random pattern throughout the room. Along the western wall, a 
chest high platform supports several copper vats. A long fire 
pit has been recessed in the dark stone beneath the vats, 
allowing them to be heated. Off to the side of a dark wood door, 
a carved wooden staircase winds up the wall and to a large 
balcony overlooking the workspace below.

eggshell finish and a large double hung window is faceted on one 
of the walls to allow the occupants to look over the storefront 
below. A large stone fireplace has been set into the western 
wall, the hearth surrounded by plush soft pillows. The floor is 
a dark stained wood, polished to sheen and contrasts the staunch 
white of the walls. A low platform has been carefully placed in 
the corner of the room nearest the fireplace with sheer cloth 
panels having been hung from the ceiling to drape the corner of 
the platform and onto the floor.

abruptly. Howling through the rock over head the wind howls 
loudly carrying a thin cloud of sooty black dust that disapates 
against the western wall of the boxed canyon. Boulders and large 
rocks litter the pathway with sparse vegetation growing between 
them. The walls above you in an uneven pattern, casting strange

   Stepping into this room instantly greets one with the smells

this kitchen is filled with steamy aromas and is bustling with 
the sounds of cooking and shouting. A stone oven covers the 
eastern wall, often containing the smells of baked goods unless 
it has undergone a recent cleaning. Simple but sturdy wood makes 
up the flooring and walls of this room and a solitary window 
stands open on the northern wall. The wooden roof has a closable 
wooden vent to be used if too much smoke or steam gathers in the 
area.

quarters for servants and a work room have been placed between 
the walls of large, neatly cut blocks of white stone, all of them 
bare but the floor laid over with a bed of rushes. A long 
staircase winds its way about the room to lead to the second 
level of the building, and a small door, decorated with elaborate 
carvings of a hunting scene, opens inwards to the store-front to 
the east.

northern wall and the floor about them. The floor has been made 
of tinted pinewood running horizontally with the walls. The 
sweet aroma of meats and scents are ever present and seems to 
have been soaked into the walls and waft in from the southern 
workroom. The confines of this smallish, dull hall aren't 
particularly cramped but has been set in an attempt to make it 
look more spacious and elaborate than it actually is.

Small Storage Cupboard~
   Numerous shelves here hold all sorts of goods, mostly perfume

space; the likelihood of one filling all the gaps here is slim to 
none. The walls and floor sandstone, the cupboard is seperated 
from the rest of the building by a thick curtain that lies to the 
south.

A Well Kept Storefront~
   Entrance through the wide oak door on reveals a shop with 
hardwood floors and very clean walls of warm brown wood. The 
simple pine counter sits at the back of the store, with a variety 
of armor pieces in various shelves distributed along the walls. 
A number of stands line the left and right sides of the store: 
however, a clear line of walking is provided between the counter 
and the exit into the marketplace. A separate, unobstrusive door 
is set into the middle of the eastern wall. Two lanterns hanging 
from the ceiling provide adequate illumination even in the dark.

A Simple Storeroom~
   In stark contrast to the outside of the shop is this simple, 
almost plain area. A book of receipts lies simply on the table, 
pages open for perusing at leisure. Supplies are neatly arranged 
in clusters throughout the room in preparation for actual sale. 
Lacking windows of any kind, only a single lamp in the center of 
the room permits any extra light after sunset.

   This shopfront has been sealed off by two doors, one to the 
west as its entrance and the other thick wooden door to the east. 
Set upon the middle of the floor here near the eastern door is a 
set of wooden table halves. Each end of the table has been 
roughly cut and then sanded smooth with boards nailed on its 
underside to hold together, serving as a makeshift counter for 
business it serves its purpose. The table having been made a 
cedar wood it has been given a finish of woodstain. The eastern 
door has been bolted with heavy iron to support it, a pad-lock 
has been placed midway in the door?s surface. Having a door set 
upon the west and eastern ways, it gives off a seemingly sealed 
room.

room as been converted into a small kitchen with a series of 
shelves and a counterspace. The three walls making up this room 
have been giving a light stain to bring out their stain and 
grain, remnants of paint sticking in places. Covering the pine 
planked flooring are a series of worn, soft old rugs. In the 
northwest corner of the room is a simple, pine stepladder leading 
up to the trapdoor. A rounded window has been placed upon the 
northern wall here, allowing light to enter.

creating a colorful mishmash that flutters gaily in the slightest 
breeze. The roof overhead is a solid piece of cloth badly dyed 
but colorful still, coated with wax to keep the majority of the 
weather out. Makeshift shelves and bins hold various articles of 
clothing, while some hang on display, threaded through ropes like 
streamers affixed to the ceiling. Taking up a considerable 
amount of room, a hefty cabinet rests along the northwest corner,

housing jars oddly with the surrounding rocky bluff. The pale 
buildings contrasts against the dark mountains, and vibrant 
tarpaulins stretch out before the few dwellings here further 
adding to the oddness. The way continues east through more 
quaint housing. 
   Smashed crates and broken bottles litter the ground.

Inside a Ventilated, Wooden Furnished Menagerie.~
   A solid door allows entry from the Bazaar to the south whereas 
to the north a door leads further into the menagerie, where the 
noise of animals and birds can often be heard. This shop is not 
a normal shop. Cages are set around the room containing various 
creatures. Some birds sit freely in their place, great falcons 
and other vicious birds of prey. The shop keep is often found 
bustling about, ensuring the animals get their full of respective 
foods. There is a wild feel, to this shop and the smell of 
animals, ventilated as the room is only adds to the demeanor. 
Wooden walls and floors, containing scratches and marks that 
appear to have been dealt by the rooms occupants complete this 
room.

An Oddly Quiet, Relaxing Backroom~
   This backroom is oddly quiet, relaxing almost because of that 
fact alone, the bustle of the bazaar, the noise of the animals 
all seem to be dampened by this room. Of decent size and width, 
this room offers enough room for a small crowd to stand and seat 
themselves easily. A stout door to the south leads into the 
storefront of the Menagerie. A staircase leads up to a door 
leading further into the house well a oddly wide trap-door leads 
down into what one could assume is a cellar.

A Large, Cellar Under the Backroom and Shop Front~
   This large, ventilated cellar is where the animals being 
trained, kept merely not on sale. Stocks of food and equipment 
required to maintain the animals and menagerie are kept against 
the southern wall, little organization used in the placement. 
Cages, pens, leashes, chains and sometimes merely perches are 
scattered about the room to keep the animals in check. The walls 
are stone and the ground made of the same sturdy rock. The roof 
however is a solid wood, which somehow has gathered several 
scratches along its length.

A Messy, Functional Bedroom~
   This room obviously hasn't had a womans touch. Things are 
left to keep as best they can on their own as the owner doesn't 
seem to pay much care to housework. Walls of timber have been 
constructed with some care to allow some finery to the bedroom 
should it be maintained. A window to the south looks out the 
bustling market stalls of the Haradrim Bazaar. To the northern 
end of a room a discreet ladder leads up to a trapdoor.

A Stuffy, Sparsely Lit Attic~
   Accessed only by the trapdoor leading down into the bedroom, 
this attic is small, enough room for one or two people to stand 
hunched. It offers the owner a place to store more private and 
secretive things along with room for items not needed elsewhere. 
It is dark, lit only a little by a small, shuttered window facing 
northward. The room is often hot and stuffy, added with the 
darkness it is not a pleasant place to spend too much time.

A Broken Archway in the Rocks~
   Tucked under the partial shelter of a natural stone archway, 
weather and sky-light is still able to filter through the ragged 
crevice in the ceiling of this cave-like walkway. The walls are 
uneven, almost dangerously jagged in places as it follows a 
slight curve. The floor is kept clean, carved from the very 
stone, which slopes upward at a gentle angle. A single sconce 
holds a ready torch under cover of a jutting outcrop, offering a 
source of light during the night hours. 
   Set into the eastern opening, an elegantly wrought iron gate 
locks undesirables from what appears to be a small garden beyond. 
Leading in the opposite direction, the path angles sharply into 
man-carved steps, which winds down into the Haradaic Bazaar 
below.

A Small Garden Overlooking the Bazaar~
   Set upon a fairly wide ledge and facing primarily to the west 
and south, a small garden has been made of this conveniently 
located shelf against the mountains. Thin strips of fertile 
earth present themselves between loosely cobbled stones, the 
rocks appearing to be nothing more than the rubble picked out 
from the garden's soil. A wrought-iron railing borders the ledge 
to prevent accidental falling, leaving an ideal lattice for 
climbing vines. Trees line one edge where the soil goes 
especially deep. And in the southeast corner, a natural spring 
flows from a crack in the stone and fills a small, shallow pool, 
eventually trickling over and disappearing over the sloping edge. 
   Part of the garden path dips into arched cave to the west, the 
opening gated with a beautifully wrought-iron gate.

   Contained in a small room, this infirmary boasts of smooth, 
whitewashed walls, a cold stone floor, and efficient storage 
space. A small work table lies against one wall, decorated with 
a plethora of small cubbies and small drawers. A plain table 
lies within the center of the room, covered only with a thin 
mattress and a clean sheet, made for the sole purpose of 
examination. Another corner bears a narrow table with a small 
wash basin at the ready. 
   A thin cloth curtain hangs in the doorway, serving as a poor 
shield from the noises of the adjoining room.

   This small, square tent offers room for four or five 
individuals within its striped canvas walls. The orange stripes 
seem on the pale side as though having buffered the elements for 
some time, while its white stripes are bright and clean. A 
mixture of herbs, both fragrant and medicinal, fills the small 
space of this tent. Several makeshift racks have been set up 
along the striped walls to hold and display wares. A large 
cabinet looms in the back of the tent, a lock fitted into the

   A well-arranged workshop filled with inks and parchments The 
bulk of what this room contains is visible immediately to the 
entrance. Maintaining their place in various shelves and 
sometimes even cabinets are interesting items and books. The 
mass of parchments, quills and ink jars seem to be centered 
around a large desk, supposedly the main work station for this 
book lovers workshop. Made of solid materials the walls are 
well-crafted and the floors and ceilings an accompaniment of 
equal make. A door leads into the workshop from the storefront 
to the west while on the eastern end of the room a set of stairs 
ascend to a door leading to further backrooms.

rest against the face of a sculpted, cement cliff face, the area 
shaded by an overhang of artificial stone.

   Surrounded by tall, craggy cliffs this small, forested basin 
has been formed over the centuries by the gentle pounding of the 
thin waterfall that runs down the face of the eastern mountains, 
forming a small, deep pool of water. The pool bears a long, 
narrow shape and tapers to form a winding river which passes 
westwards at a lazy pace between tall, jagged pillars of stone. 
A wide, shallow cavern cuts into the face of the stone to the 
south, while the northern edge of the small basin slopes upwards 
sharply, a rough cliff face that rises up into the sky.

   Smelling of mold and wet sod, this pipe is wide enough for 
five men to stand shoulder to shoulder and high enough for a man 
to stand comfortably and long enough for two men to lay foot to 
head. The hollowed clay is rotting and riddled with cracks. 
This section of the pipe is blocked with collapsed dirt and 
rocks. It is dry and quiet and reminiscent of a tomb and as 
cold. Moss covers the clay underfoot rendering movement silent. 
A steady, distant drip is heard from an unknown location.

A Balcony overlooking an endless Sea~
   This is a wide, semicircular balcony of white marble 
overlooking a sea of immense proportions. Seemingly bathed in 
endless night the sound of waves crashing upon rocks far below is 
a perpetual accompaniment to the occasional seabird that wheels 
overhead. The sky above is scattered with a boundless array of 
stars that are mirrored in the inky depths of the sea below until 
the two seem to meet at the distant horizon. The balcony itself 
extends from a white palace of immense proportions, though even 
that is dwarfed by the immense mountain upon which the buiding is 
nestled. Looking down, one can see the twinkling lightsof a 
large settlement at the base of this mountain, though it is too 
distant for any sound to carry to these lofty heights. A door 
back into this palace can be seen not far away, and the sea 
breeze ruffles the silken drapes that hang there just enough to 
allow a small beam of light to escape from within and create a 
pool of luminesence in this otherwise dim environment.

floor and walls, their buzzing sounds echoing gently off the 
stone walls. Hanging on the walls are many amateur pictures of 
Shadow, and on the floor are some random articles of clothing, 
strewn about carelessly. A small light comes through from a 
small hole in the wall. If one looked close enough, they may be 
able to see into the next room.

Deep Inside An Old Cave~
   Deep enough for the deepest parts to be bathed in dark, this 
cave is just high enough to allow a man inside. A single path 
way marks out the center of the cave, wide enough for a man to 
pace along and made of smooth, dark stone. It leads to the rear 
of the cave before halting at a smooth cave wall. Catching some 
of the wind that blows outside a low moan of it passing through 
is nearly a constant.

   The beaten path follows on from wooded west to a small meadow 
to the east, though a small turn leads towards the north where a 
small cave can be found, just large enough for a man to enter 
upright. Dotted around the land outside it, a dozen trees grow, 
unfetted and strong. Little sound save for the rustle of the 
trees and harmless wildlife can be heard. As the trail turns off 
towards the cave, a narrow pathway of black flagstones has been 
sunk in to the ground.

green grass groans with little care, though through the center of 
the woods a slim trail has been walked, though no other signs of 
habitation can be seen or heard. Far above in the trees the odd 
tweet and squawk of wildlife can be heard.

   Along the western shore of this small island a sandy beach has 
formed allowing for a small wooden jetty to be extend a few dozen 
feet out. Only a couple of strides wide it allows only the 
smallest of boats safely without letting them run aground. A few 
strides deeper into the island and it opens up in to a dense 
woodland, a small trail leads off from the beach and weaves in to 
the woods, old and well treaded.

the water level rises up to the waist of a fully grown man presenting
little threat to those on the island.  South, a narrow pathway has been

The Bowels Of The Island~
   Hard walls of stone make up the inside of this cave. Of great 
age, they have been worn smooth with the passage of time. Under 
foot thick slabs of foreign of dark stone lie, as with the wall 
they have been worn smooth, these with the passage of many feet. 
Dug in the center of the room a low fire pit lies, the same dark 
stone lining it. Above it a narrow chamber has been dug allowing 
the faint smoke passage outside, though little else. Even with 
the little ventilation the air is musty and heavy, made worse 
should the fire be lit.

Onboard An Old Dhow~
   A small vessel, this dhow has one main sail and one aft sail, 
both mounted in a forty-five degree angle. There are no markings 
on the vessel itself or on the sails. It is large enough to hold 
a dozen or so men and appears to be sea-worthy as well as swift. 
There is a small cabin below deck that could house the sailors 
should bad weather hit.

atecho 73333 The dhow skims over the water as it moves quickly down the river, pushed along by the fierce current. Suddenly there is a call from the lookout of a ship on the horizon and the dhow's captain calls for evasive maneuvers into a small cove along the side of the river. The sails are struck and #5you#0 wait until the other ship sails past, unaware of #5your#0 dhow in the cove. Once the coast is clear, and the other ship is far up the river, the sails are raised once more and the dhow slides back into the river, moving on.
