A Small Storeroom~
   This storeroom is barely clean enough to keep the meat here 
fresh. Stone walls are clearly not washed too often and rivulets 
of blood drain into a central plug with the distant sound of the 
sewers beneath confirmed by a rising smell during the Summer 
months. A compact old oak door leads westwards into the 
shopfront itself.

Tirith. He's a middle-aged man who prefers good food, wine, and 
music to actual work. He likes relaxing and lazily enjoying 
life. In his youth he was into adventure, but now he just wants 
to sit back and retire with much money, as he's grown overly-fond 
of comfortable living.

   Storage for Jeric, a poor but hardworking farmer who runs
the creamery of the First Circle. He's bright, a newlywed who's
full of optimism about the future and high hopes for himself.
His wife's a weaver who makes homespun somewhere around 1st circle.
He's completely on the side of the lower-class folk, and will cut
a good deal for one of his own class, but he has a poor man's 
natural dislike of very well-to-do people -- he'll be absolutely
courteous, but won't go out of his way usually.

of Osgiliath out of charity as well as necessity. She is a

   This small storage closet houses a small workroom and a few

non-existent due to how the walls have been sealed up with solid 
wood planking. The bottom of the floor however, is made out of 
mortared brick and stretches the length of this closet. While 
this room is shorter then the main room of the shop it isnt so

directly into the walls. A number of large bins lay about the 
place, stacked full of old and now worthless goods, while stock 
fit for sale is arranged on the racks and shelves that ring the 
room. Light is cast down from a single lantern suspended from 
the roof, deep shadows cast in the corners due to this slight 
illumination. A stout oak door is set in the southern wall.

A Dank, Dark Storage Cellar~
   The air in this cellar is heavy with moisture and the walls 
glisten in the dim light. In some places water can be seen 
running down the rough-hewn stone of the walls, likely emanating 
from the very earth this cellar was dug from. The thick smell of 
mold is apparent and indeed it seems to have succeeding in 
advancing up the stone walls to various levels throughout. A 
trapdoor is set into the ceiling, with a set of uneven steps 
leading down from above.

Store Room for Auviel. Mob 2133, Shop 2571~
   The Potter's Wheel - A shop run by Auviel with the help of her 
son, Allen, in the slums of Minas Tirith. Sells all manner of 
pottery goods as well as the supplies to make them, and runs a 
brisk if not incredily profitable trade in raw clay. She buys 
low and sells low, and thus often manages to draw plenty of 
customers to her store, but her lack of greed and the fine she 
pays to the Rogues for 'protection' ensures that she stays 
somewhat poor. She is a truly good-natured soul, despite her 
less-than-perfect looks and shoddy clothing. She loves her 
business, and is very talkative and friendly.

a license, or a good location, but had definite talent, and 
decided to open shop in the first floor of a crumbling house he 
inhereted from his now-dead mother. The location isn't a very 
bad one, as it is right off Rath Earandil, and he gets the 
occasional richer customer, along with all the poor and ragged 
that come to him for cheap remedies and and niceties to make the 
stench and squalor of their living quarters a little more 
bearable.

A Small Stone-Walled Storage Pit Beneath The Mill~
   The walls of this small storage pit are made of stone to keep 
out moisture from the nearby river. Barely tall enough to give a 
short man head-room, a taller man would find its ceiling somewhat 
low. The floor of this room, while also lined with stone, is 
somewhat damp, suggesting that water does indeed seep in from 
surrounding soil.

   This is the storage room for Granis, a butcher in Osgilath's 
west side. He's not particularly picky about what he buys, and 
he's a no-nonsense, gruff sort of guy. He won't take anything 
that's obviously rotted, but as for the rest, business is 
business and it's just going to get cooked anyway. He keeps his 
prices low enough to be competitive, and buys for a relatively 
fair price, which in turn brings out a healthy amount of business 
despite his less-than-reputable sources. A lot of that pay goes 
to the Rogues, however, because despite his toughness, he doesn't 
feel like having to deal with a bunch of armed thugs wreaking 
havoc at night.

Barrel Shaped Underground Vault~
   This large, barrel shaped underground vault is used to store 
money and the precious metals and gems sold by the usury. The 
walls are made of large granite blocks reinforced with mortar and 
iron rods, preventing would be thieves from tunneling into the 
vault from the outside. Thick sheets of iron plating have been 
used to line the walls, floor and ceiling adding extra 
reinforcement to allow the vault to withstand an explosive blast. 
Under dire circumstances the vault has been used as a stronghold 
during attacks on the city. Several lanterns, attached to the 
walls, provide light inside this otherwise pitch dark room. A 
solid, iron door with a formidable lock provides egress into the 
narrow passageway outside. A long iron bar can be slid across 
the door to prevent it from being knocked in.

Store Rm: Vincent: Mob 1407, rm 1355~
   Owner's name is Vincent. Doesn't have much of a sense of
humour, but likes hearing stories, especially ones from adventuerers.
Stylised him as a bit of one, but thinks he can't leave tavern because
he's too important.
Tavern is mainly used by guards and watchmen, not many civillians come
by. Place for very sombre, heavy drinking, where getting drunk is perfected
to an art. The patrons hate disturbances, and tend to end them permenantly.

floor clean, and the shelving comprised of thick, freshly-cut 
wood.

Backside of a Tent~
   There is little space to move in the backside of this red and

and bright costumes have been piled wherever there is space, a 
number of them leaning at alarming angles. A narrow path of the 
cobblestones on which the tent has been erected weaves its way 
through the stored items, and a flap set to the south allows 
passage to the main area of the tent.

Storage Room, The Leaking Barrel Tavern~
   This back room of the tavern is used strictly for storing 
gallons and gallons of drinks, as well as a few non-perishable 
food items. Dusty walls and a dirt-splotched floor make up this 
rather cramped room, surrounded on the east and west by stacks of 
barrels. The thick odor of alcohol permeates this place. 
   A tall door of mahogany stands to the south, heavily 
contrasting the filth of the rest of the tavern. There is a 
small rectangular hole near the top of the door, though it looks 
to be covered by a panel on the other side.

customers a good looking over to make sure he's not going to end 
up being mugged.

Store Rm: Halsik: mob 1156, shop 1466~
   Halsik is a VERY suspicious fellow. If the Watch 
comes-a-questioning, he'll be more than happy to tell them 
whatever they ask, rather than risk getting into trouble himself. 
He speaks with a slight stutter as well, and isn't all that 
popular due to the fact that he would more likely turn in a pal 
to save his own skin.

Store Rm: Taff: mob 1157, shop 1467~
   Taff sells low to medium quality weapons, and DOES NOT TAKE 
CUSTOM ORDERS. He doesn't make 'em, he sells what he gets. So 
no customs, 'kay? He's a fairly bright lad, and he'd probably 
have been better off with his nose in a book than selling weapons 
off a wagon. Kind of shy too, but does the best he can.

Store Rm: Frenn Sabian: mob 1159, shop 1520~
   Frenn Sabian grew up in a fairly low-class family. Thus, he's 
had to make it on his own, and is damn proud of it. He entered 
early into the street traders and worked his way along through 
wit and talent, as well as a persuasive tongue. He doesn't give 
any quarter when making deals, and is very defensive about the 
high quality of his goods.

A Cold Storage Cellar~
   This earthen cellar has packed-dirt walls that are whitewashed,
giving the room an antiseptic appearance and scent. A sturdy wooden
staircase leads down to it from a trapdoor set in the ceiling. Beams
in the ceiling support the room. Shelves and racks made of wood
along the walls hold a variety of stored meats, down where it is
so much cooler, as indeed it does tend to stay uniformly cool no
matter what the temperature is.

he'll want definate proof that he's going to get his money paid 
back. Other than that, he'll field pretty much anything short of 
financing an army.

A Finely Accoutered Store Room~
   This storage room is large, but well-ordered. Fine cabinets 
hold delicate glassware and collectibles on the uppermost 
shelves, while the larger row of bottom shelving holds an array 
of bolts of fine fabric, decorative items and oversized goods. 
Small chests of drawers with polished brass-knob pulls are used 
to store the smaller, expensive bits of jewelery and pretty 
trinkets. Muted light filters through the glass-paned door, 
softly illuminating the myriad of exquisite items. 
   A small trapdoor sits in the corner of the storeroom.

Store Rm: Henry: Mobile 1184, Shop 11095~
   Henry runs the Rath Celerdain Forge. The Forge specialises in 
smelting, refining and the sale and storage of metal ores. 
Please make sure he stocks only these items. The man himself is 
short and very hairy with a big head and double chin. He is very 
loud and bossy and extremly unrefined and grubby. He spends all 
day every day in his courtyard screaming at the cart owners and 
his own staff as the stock is moved around the area.

   Glazed grey tiles cover the floor of this small kitchen, its 
walls freshly-painted a bright white in color. A large stove 
dominates the far corner of the room while lining the walls are 
various shelves. Set into the western wall is a fireplace, white 
stones surrounding its base to prevent ash and woodchips from 
spilling out onto the floor and in the northern wall, a small 
window is high set, allowing a slight breeze to pass through. A 
curtain covering the eastern archway allows passage into the 
large workroom beyond.

A Spacious Antechamber~
   The walls of this room have been freshly-painted a warm sienna 
brown in color including the ceiling though the plank floor 
boords seem somewhat worn but still in good condition. The room 
itself is rather spacious, large enough to accomodate quite a few 
pieces of furniture while still providing ample space for people 
to mov around comfortably. A window is set in the eastern wall, 
providing sunlight during the daytime and has been covered by 
crisp, ivory-colored linen curtains. Hung upon the walls are 
numerous pieces of well-polished armor and shields of varying 
sizes and types of metal but all clearly masterfully-crafted. A 
door to the north leads to the workroom while a curtain separates 
the antechamber from the kitchen beyond to the west. The door 
set atop the stairs leads to the dormitory and the one in the 
southern wall leads back out to the shop front.

A Small, Dirt-Filled Yard~
   This small yard bears no grass. Instead, it is only a 
wood-fenced area, the ground made of hard-packed dirt with small 
sprouts of weeds growing here and there from the dark earth. It 
is an unkept and rather sorry lot, dirt and mud staining the 
stone wall of the building south upon which a thick, wooden door 
can slide open or closed. The door itself bears a large and 
intimidating bronze lock and bears no window capable of peering 
into the building itself.

   A cool, moist air circulates around this lower basement 
storage room, giving the space a damp, boggy smell. A rock floor 
with a large drainage hole cut in the center whisks away the 
rainwater that often collects in the soggy soil behind the wooden 
walls during storms. The storage shelves in this space appear 
ransacked and ill-cared for, with obvious signs that rats and 
other wildlife entered, gnawed, and feasted on the wooden 
furnishings and food stores. A knotty-looking, wobbly-legged 
wooden ladder allows one to #6leave#0 the #6storeroom#0.
