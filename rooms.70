A Roughly Dug Stone Stair~
   Wide stone stairs lead steeply upward here, the lips worn 
smooth, probably by lack of care on the parts of their creators. 
The air grows thicker as one descends, and a heavy darkness fills 
the corridor. It is fairly quiet here, the occasional distant 
screech or shuffling echoing through the tunnels. The passage 
continues to the south, the floor smoothed to allow ease of 
movement.

A Wide, Dark Underground Tunnel~
   Fairly featureless, this tunnel is dark, angling through the 
solid stone of the mountain as it heads from north to south. The 
ceiling is high enough to walk unobstructed, and the air is hot, 
stuffy, and laden with unpleasant scents. The atmosphere 
thickens to the south, and the darkness almost seems palpable 
there.

A Curved, Dingy Stone Passage~
   This passage curves, the soot-blackened walls fading in dingy 
darkness to the eye. Some care has been taken to level the 
floor, and the walls are cut from stone and smoothed, although 
the marks of tools become more evident as the tunnel curves to 
the east. A few low holes have been dug into the side of the 
passage, no doubt housing for the denizens of these caverns. 
Strewn across the ground can be seen stone shards and dust, 
remains of mining or stone working.

Crude And Hastily Built Tunnels~
   With much brute force and fire have the warrens been expanded, 
scorching marks of flame visible on the sharp and broken stones. 
A section of tunnels broken up which left crude and sharp, uneven 
walls and a floor covered in stone shards that is a nightmare to 
an unprotected foot. In the west there is a heavily reinforced 
door set in a deep stone socket.

A Fume-Choked Tunnel Intersection~
   The sound of water is heard faintly here, the source a trickle 
of filthy water that runs down the corner of the intersection and 
vanishes into a narrow crack in the floor. Visibility is poor, 
sulfurous fumes mixing with sooty smoke to create a miasma of 
barely-breathable air. There is little of interest here 
otherwise, save the continuance of passageways that lead west, 
east, and south.

A Low, Stifling Tunnel~
   Heavy with fumes and smoke, this tunnel is cut into solid 
stone. Various dim warren-holes and burrows line the walls, 
covered mostly by thin wooden doors or mangy curtains. The 
ceiling in the area is low, barely five feet in height, and no 
lights are present. The footing is rather treacherous in any 
case, as a thin haze of smoke curls as it settles amidst the 
craggy rock.

A Sharp, Angular, Underground Turn North of an Orkish Tavern~
   This wide tunnel makes a very sharp turn here, the stone walls 
ending abruptly at a ragged section of wall to the south and 
continuing on eastward. At several points on the rough section 
of wall issue forth steam. These hot, sulfurous fumes leak 
slowly out, filling the air with a heavy and stifling scent. A 
haze hangs over the area, particularly the floor, where a layer 
of foggy wisps collect. To the south, the entranceway to a 
tavern fashioned out of a wooden shack built on top of the cave 
walls is wide open, dim lit coming from within.

A Stuffy, Curving Tunnel Branching Off to the South~
   A wavering curve marks the path of this tunnel, the walls 
zagging this way and that as they lead through solid stone. 
Along the way, they open at points into small caves and burrows, 
from which issue forth rancid smells that taint the already heavy 
air. The scent of sulfur mixes into this heavy odor, creating a 
very stuffy atmosphere. The floor is mostly even, however, and 
seems to become much more so as the tunnel leads to the south. 
To the east and west, the passage is much rougher. A large, 
bulging mount of rock has a narrow, rickety wooden staircase 
leading up to it, the stone walls painted with crude faces.

A Small, Filthy Cave-Market Before an Orkish Tavern~
   The atmosphere in this cavern is cluttered, filthy, and loud. 
Decrepit shanties, stalls, tents, and structures line every 
available wall and pillar. Some are abandoned, but many house 
merchants, tinkers, or repairmen of varying description wander 
around. Little of value seems present here, however, most 
services seem aimed at the meager needs of those who dwell in 
these dark pits. Perched on a shelf of stone at the end of the 
cave stands a haphazard wooden building, its eastern door thrown 
wide open and looking to be a tavern of some sorts.

A Broad, Hastily Dug Tunnel Intersection~
   Apparently dug from solid stone at a quick pace, the marred 
walls of this intersection dotted here and there with small, 
circular doors or warren-burrows covered with mangy hides. The 
air is heavy with stench, the dismal surroundings continuing as 
the passage zags to the east, and leads north and west as well.

A Zig-Zagging Warren Shaft~
   Cutting a jagged path through the solid mountain rock, this 
passage is lined heavily with a series of burrows, tent-houses, 
lean-tos, and warren holes. A staggering smell wafts from the 
slick goo that coats the floor. The ceiling is low, with plenty 
of crags and fissures to trick the eye amidst the darkness of the 
tunnel. The passage loops back on itself in a sharp turn at the 
end, leaving the only point of exit to the west.

A Roughly Hacked Stone Tunnel~
   Roughly hacked stone walls, pitted and lined with warrens, run 
along this tunnel. The air is heavy with the smells of 
habitation, most of which are foul enough to choke the lungs. 
The floor is pebbly and rough, and sounds occasionally echo 
through the area from distant fights, squabbles, or other unknown 
happenings. The darkness is heavy here as the tunnel leads north 
and south.

A Hazy, Soot-Choked Passageway~
   A hole leading off the side of this passageway is apparently 
home to some smelting or forging operation, as hot smoke and soot 
billows forth in occasional puffs from within. This does very 
little good for the air here, which is already uncomfortably warm 
and strangely still. Now and then, however, a noticable pressure 
difference is created as the smoke is sucked toward the east, 
where an almost constant, dull moan of moving air is heard. In 
this direction, the walls and floor seem to take on a more 
natural appearance, as opposed to the south, where the marks of 
tools can be seen in the stone.

A Stinking Hovel~
   This room is no more then a stinking hovel, with walls 
haphazardly made up of rocks and hard packed-in dirt that often 
crumbles off to the rocky floor below in small patches. A foul 
stench seems to pervade the air at all times and does not seem to 
leave, as the air is completely still with no where to go. The 
small hovel fits no more then a handful of individuals, affording 
little room in the damp, persistently dark place. The only exit 
is a crude door painted a stained-purple, leading out into the 
tunnels of the under warrens.
