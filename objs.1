sword SIMPLE_QUALITY sturdy iron longsword METAL~
a sturdy, iron longsword~
A sturdy-looking iron longsword lies here, its blade somewhat marred.~
   This iron longsword looks as though it was forged to be sturdy 
and functional. Though its workmanship is average at best, and 
hammer marks mar the blade in a few places, it does seem to hold 
a decent edge. The crosspiece is fashioned of a rounded piece of 
iron with slightly flattened ends. The hilt is wrapped in soft, 
brown leather to allow a better grip, and the ball-shaped pommel 
provides a suitable counterweight.

A dagger lies here, its sharp edges glinting in the light.~
   There is nothing particularly flashy about this dagger. The 
iron is dull, but the blade is fairly sharp. The crossguard is

turned upward toward the blade. The rough, wooden hilt has been 
crosshatched to provide a somewhat better grip, and the 
decorative pommel is a small rounded ball.

crafted from quality iron, the blade is now nicked along its once

from old blood, which has pocked its once smooth surface. The 
crossguard curls at the ends, and is engraved with swirl-like 
patterns, most of which are worn beyond recognition. The hilt is 
wrapped in dry, darkened leather, and the simple rounded pommel 
bears dents and scratches. Although it is ancient, this sword

poleaxe SIMPLE_QUALITY long iron headed axe polearm METAL METAL~
a long, iron-headed poleaxe~
A long pole lies here, an iron axehead affixed to the top.~
   This poleaxe, made primarily for countering mounted foes, 
consists of a very long hardwood shaft with a multi-purpose iron 
head. The blade of the weapon is a convex-shaped axehead, but 
the end also tapers to a spear-like point, so the weapon can be 
used either to chop or to thrust at opponents. Each of the 
weapon's edges is sharpened and the wooden shaft is reinforced 
with iron bands to better withstand the charge of a mounted 
enemy.

off the shoulders and extends to just above the knees when worn. 
The weave is tight but soft to the touch, creating a garment that 
drapes from the body in an almost fluid manner, and does not 
hinder a wearer's movements. It attaches around the neck by a 
golden chain that connects two golden discs.

requiring the use of both hands to wield it properly.

crisscross the surface, holding the dense padding in place within 
the interior walls. Heavy thighbones of some humanoid creature 
have been bisected lengthwise and mounted along the outer edges 
of each sleeve, helping to deflect oncoming blows. Despite their 
sturdy nature, the sleeves are remarkably flexible, a testament 
to the leatherworker's expertise.

   Two layers of hardy, tan leather have been stuffed with some 
sort of padding, which decreases the amount of force the wearer 
must absorb. Stitched sinew forms a diamond pattern across the 
surface of these leggings, only broken by the bisected thighbones 
mounted to the outside edges of the leggings. The thick bone 
helps to redirect attacks, especially those of bladed weapons 
that the leather beneath is so vulnerable to. On the whole, the 
leggings are a startling blend of ingenuity and functionality.

a razor-sharp, ivory-hilted longknife~
An ivory-hilted longknife lies here, the light reflecting off its razor edge.~
   This elegant, stylish weapon has a long, narrow single-edged
blade that is wickedly sharp, made with a higher-quality steel
than most other weapons. The metal fairly glimmers in the light.
It meets a hardwood hilt wrapped in chain, with sleek quillions
and a ring-shaped thumbguard, both of bright silver. The ivory
of the hilt is pale against the bronze chain, with the pommel
made of silver and also inset with an ivory disc carved to
resemble a stylized blooming flower.

a simple, iron lockpick~
A simple, iron lockpick lies on the ground collecting dust.~
   This sturdy lockpick is made of somewhat dulled iron. It is 
made in the simple design of the ratchet and the probe. The 
probe is more delicate, thinner twisting slightly at the end to 
flip a delicate lever such at the inner workings of a locking 
mechanism, while the ratchet is more forceful, designed to pry 
apart the plates to allow access to the lever.

bottom that permits it to be stood upwards on a level surface. A 
rough cork keeps the bottle airtight; when the bottle is still 
unopened, a layer of wax with the distinctive "Old Winyards" seal 
secures the cork to the neck of the container. A small 
handwritten label sports a light sketch of a grapevine along with 
"Old Winyards" scribed in the Westron tongue using 
Gondorian-Tengwar sigils.

three locations, the barrel is circumvented by thick iron bands. 
A narrow spout allows smaller containers to be filled.

A small oaken cask labeled 'mead' has been set here.~
   Warped and carefully carved oaken planks intertwine to form a 
small wooden cask. There is a small valve on one side of the 
cask that allows the contents to be poured into some sort of 
smaller container; the valve could also be detached, so that the 
cask could be refilled through the resulting hole. A stained 
paper label has the word 'Mead' written on it.

The curved pewter handle is shaped in the form of a fearsome 
dragon's head and neck, with the neck attached to one end of the 
cane, so as to make it appear that the wooden part of the cane is 
the body of the dragon. Upon closer observation, one may 
discover a piece of flint within the dragon's mouth, allowing 
someone to create a spark by sliding a knife or dagger through 
the creature's mouth.

Discarded here is a woolen tunic, a $color in colour.~
   This tunic has been knitted from wool dyed $color in
colour, the material reaching down to the mid-thighs and 
elbows while worn. Fairly loose, the tunic does little to
restrict movement and is of sturdy enough work and design
to survive the rigours of everyday life.

This thick, iron key has a vague reddish tint to its
design. A solid loop at the end made to be placed on
a keyring. About 5 inches in length the teeth of the
key are thick and firm, this is probably for a gate,
not a chest or door.

function ability over fashion it is fairly straight forward in 
its construction. Twin cylindrical bars of wood allow for a wide 
variety of weapons to lie against them. At least 6 feet in

flimsy to hold in the hand. With the edges and point
deliberately blunted on the wooden blade, this dagger seems
for training purposes only. The practice dagger looks to

and measures three feet in length. The hilt is a simple cross
guard with a plain wooden handle, allowing firm grip for one
hand. The wood has a coarse, grainy finish to it.

due to the padding, attached to the club by several nails, this
item is more suited to practice then real warfare.

up and down the bar, but towards one end it has been kicked end,

an extravagant, dark-wood canopy bed covered in snow-white silk sheets~
An extravagant, dark stained canopy bed with snow-white silk sheets stands with its headboard centered against the southern wall.~
   This large antique-looking bed has an ornate, overly ornamented
look about it. Its massive frame is made of mahogany, carved richly
in archaic and significant scrollwork, while its four posters and
canopy look like they have ivy growing all along them, all rendered
lavishly in carving. The sheets covering the feather mattress are
snow-white and made of silk, with neatly hemmed edges. It is an
outstanding piece of furniture, expensive and genteel-looking.

A circular bench carved out of white marble stands here.~
   Carved from one solid block of white marble, this bench has 
been fashioned into a circle, allowing someone to sit down facing 
in any direction away from the bench. Several decorative trees 
have once been engraved upon the circular pedestal that composes 
the back of the bench, but they have now worn down to the point 
that they are barely visible.

a small oaken cask~
A small oaken cask has been set here.~
   This small cask, known as a Kilderkin is half the size of a 
standard barrel. The Kilderkin has been made by a highly skilled 
cooper and is ideal for storing precious luxuries. The white oak 
of which the cask has been made has been exposed to the elements 
for additional time to ensure the wood has been purged of 
impurities and odors which might spoil the flavours or scents of 
the contents. On the side of the barrel the cooper's guild stamp 
has been branded, along with the number eighteen marking its 
capacity in gallons.

An enormous tub, inlaid with an exquisite mosaic dominates the center of the room.~
   This mosaic-inlaid tub is large enough to easily fit more than 
a dozen people. The images depict the scenes of a glorious 
sea-battle; ships are ramming into other ships, while sailors are 
swinging across to engage the enemy, sabers and axes in hand. In 
the middle of the pool, a marble pedestal creates a miniature 
island. The tub is filled with hot, steaming red wine.

a thick, blood-stained pine table~
A thick, worn pine table stands in the center of the area, blotches of blood staining its surface.~
   Crafted from a thick pine tree, a few boards have been stuck 
together by large iron spikes, creating a solid surface. Its 
legs have been cut down, dropping the top about half the height 
of normal. Once rough wood, it has been worn smooth, dented, and 
scarred. Dark stains mar its surface, deep brown, slighty tinted 
red, unmistakable drops and blotches of dried blood. Iron rungs 
follow the outline of the table, all attached with small iron 
brads.

   The burlap cloth that makes up this bag is rough to the touch, 
made up of strong woven hemp fibres. Stitching, done with thick 
string, joins the two halves of the material together, a similar 
brown colour to that of the burlap. A coarse, fraying rope has 
been attatched to the bag for easier transportation. The bag is 
strong enough to carry quite a load for its size.

   Large enough to hold within it a blazing fire to warm the 
bones, this hearth has been constructed from small, white stones, 
though the ones on the inside of the fireplace have become 
blackened with soot and ash. A section of tiles has been laid 
down in the centre of the hearth as a place for the firewood to

   Far from the garb of a modest lady, this cotton dress has been 
fitted as a low-cut style. The cotton has been dyed a full 
$color in colour, and ends above the knees of its wearer. It is 
slightly restrictive of movement, and the stitching around this 
dress is of rather poor quality.

darker brown than the natural hue of leather. The ends of the 
shoes are pointed, however enough room remains for the feet. 
Rather thin, creamy white laces allow the pair of shoes to be 
tied and untied. These shoes are low to the ground, and look 
unsuited to extensive outdoor travel.

much care and attention to it over the years, the surface free
from scars and nicks in the wood and polished to a moderate
sheen. An occasional stain of yet-to-be removed ale and beer is
visible along the bartop, but for the whole it is fairly clean.
Ten cedar bar stools have been arranged beside the bar as it stands
along a wall.

   This bar is of an odd construct, being shaped as a square with 
the centre hollowed out to allow room for movement. A score of 
stools, five on each side, ring around the maple of the bar, set 
some distance apart from one another. The bar is rather well 
kept and polished, some simple paneling set in the outward-facing 
edge. A small section in one of the four sides has no paneling, 
allowing a part of the bartop to be flipped open to allow 
entrance and exit of the square.

oak wood is hard, and from the numerous minor scratches and scars
along its surface looks to have survived the test of time. A
pattern of ferns has been carved onto the table, running along
the edge of the tabletop and up and down the legs. Six chairs of
similar design have been arranged around the table.

the grappling hook is ill-suited for use as a weapon save for the 
truely desperate, but instead made for the purpose of scaling and 
climbing.

buttons matching the dye of the silk runs up and down the front 
ending below the neck. Great skill and craftsmanship have gone

a sharp shortsword with a leaf-patterned hilt~
A shortsword with a leaf pattern on its hilt lies here.~
   Evidently of higher quality than the standard shortsword, this 
weapon's blade, although short at two feet in length, is made of 
quality steel. Well polished and unblemished by any markings, 
the hilt has a detailed pattern of painted leaves which wrap 
around the forest-green leather of the hilt and climb up to 
surround the crossguard, lending this weapon an artistic look.

this scarf is praiseworthy, the weave soft to the skin, and silk 
thread of a similar shade to that of the scarf has been used to 
etch out a design of flowers throughout this piece of apparel.

The sword is worn and battered, its leather wrapping on the

running along its surface. The handle is rather long for such a 
short weapon, and topped with a brass pommel, giving an imperfect 
balance to the sword. The quality of the iron is rather poor, 
but this shortsword is still able to function as an inferior 
weapon.

a country landscape painting~
Upon a wall here is a painting of a country landscape.~
   Painted in soft, gentle watercolours, this painting depicts a 
scene of a peaceful countryside, the width running longer than 
the height. The green fields serve as the main focus of the 
picture, yet herds of white sheep and the occasional sleepy 
farmstead with a wisp of smoking coming from the chimney also 
feature. Possibly of any idyllic piece of land throughout 
Gondor, the white walls of a distant city set in a mountain 
painted in the top-right corner of the painting reveals it to be 
the Pelennor Fields.

a grand painting of a flock of birds~
A grand painting depicting a flock of birds in flight hangs here.~
   Strong oil colours have been used upon the canvas medium of 
this painting, boldly presenting the picture upon it. A flock of 
magpies has been captured in flight, with wings out stretched and 
set densely close together so that where one bird ends another 
starts. Another skilful feature of the painting is that the 
birds alternate in colours from the purest white to the darkest

a depiction of a warrior upon a canvas painting~
An armoured warrior looks down from a painting set on a wall.~
   Set somewhere in the blackened plains of Mordor and
thereabouts, the foreground of this painting is that of a regal
warrior, bearing a full suit of plate mail and a winged
great-helm. Around him rages a battle of death and carnage
between similarly armed men and a foul horde of gruesome orcs and
grotesque goblins, green and red blood splattering the war
ground. The frame is fashioned of simple, engraved pine.

a painting of a shaded grove~
Hanging from a wall here is a painting of a shaded grove.~
   Bound within the forest green pine frame of this painting is a 
picture of a lush, cool garden grove. Numerous willow trees with 
their drooping branches shelter the thick grass, a pair of lovers 
barely visible beneath the embrace of the vegetation. Oil 
colours have been used to depict flowers of all shapes and sizes 
that grow like wildfire among the trees in the grove. While not 
masterful work, the painting is still the product of patience and 
determination.

a dark cherry-wood dragon pipe~
A dark cherry-wood pipe carved with the likeness of a dragon lies here.~
   This wooden pipe was been delicately carved into the form a 
scaled dragon. Its wings flow up the stem of the pipe and end 
just below the stem, while its intricately detailed body makes up 
the bulk of the lower stem and bowl, its head and opened mouth 
pointing upwards. Its mouth is the actual bowl of the pipe. It 
is carved from dark hardwood and stained well.

a rose-carved, glossy nightstand~
A glossy, dark pine nightstand carved with roses stands here.~
This nightstand has been sturdily crafted from pine, then stained
to give it a dark shine. The construction is generally simple, yet
carries a touch of elegance due the flowing grain of the wood. Also
taking this nightstand a bit further beyond average are its legs,
which are curved and cascade to the ground with an appealing grace;
detailed rose vines and petals have been intricately carved around
the stand's top and down along its legs.

A standing lathe is set here.~
   This workbench-sized tool is about waist-height and easily as
long as a dinner table. Under the bench there is a foot pedal,
from which a cord runs up through a slot in the bench to the end
of a piece of sapling wood attached six or seven feet up.  When a
wooden object is ready to be turned, the cord is wrapped around the
object, which is placed between two guide posts. Pressure from the
foot rotates the object one way, and the sapling wood pulls it 
back up the other way.

dozens of semicircular openings through which winebottles may
be set so they can rest horizontally. Larger shelves along its
bottom allow casks and larger containers to be stored. The rack
is quite tall and wide -- more than large enough for even a large

   It is a small end table made of darkened, polished hardwood,
with bronze inlay decorations along its sides and near its feet.
Though clearly very old, it is in excellent shape, with no nicks
or stains, and though it does not shine like a mirror, its sheen
seems to go well beneath its surface. The table is large enough
to use only as an end table, and has a square-shaped top that
has been carved around its edges with a flowing, organic design.

which is quite large enough to display most people full-length.

a floral, scrolling design that is worked deeply into the metal,
this wide ring is chunky and heavy. It has no stone, but a stylized
crescent moon surmounted by a sword is shaped across its top. It
is sized for a man's hand, but not so wide that a woman couldn't
wear it if she liked.

its calf-length hem. An elegant and very well-made garment, it is
more decoration than proof against the elements.

trigger mechanism that moves the small latch, releasing the
connected tendon string. The entire weapon is lacquered with
bees-wax, making it sticky when exposed to heat.

to calves in thick, inflexible hide. They can be tied at the waist
or tied to a vest. The leather is probably too thick to tuck into
one's boots, though their lower edge will hit above most boots' 
tops. The leather is dyed $color.

from the beauty of the rose. The snake's coils make up part of the
base of the sculpture, making it solid enough to stand easily on

hand. Every detail possible is displayed in this elaborate, if small,
figurine. The animal sits on its haunches, somehow managing a subtle
attitude of superiority. Its mouth is open slightly, as if yawning,
with some small, sharp teeth visible in its mouth. The piece is well-
polished, gleaming brightly. Its eyes are made of cat's-eye gemstones,
dark green in color, striped in the center with much paler yellow-green
strands of color. It is altogether a spectacular piece.

that they were pieced together with durability and protection in 
mind, as the thick cushion around the fingers would make simple 
actions like picking up a small item or tying a knot 
frustratingly hard. Long enough to cover the elbow of even the 
most gangly arm, the leather at the cuff is pliable enough to 
allow for it to be folded over once and shorten the gloves to the 
wearer's size and taste.

a small, iron-weighted blackjack~
A small, iron-weighted blackjack lies here on the ground.~
   This small blackjack has a short tang for holding onto, and a 
large round pocket on the front. The pocket of the blackjack is 
filled with a lump of hardened iron, and sewn shut in black 
thread, making this a dangerous weapon in close quarters. The 
tang and pocket are made of thick black leather, and the ridges 
upon the tang make it easy to hold onto at all times.

baton SIMPLE_QUALITY small wooden WOOD~
a small, wooden baton~
A small, wooden baton lies here in the dust.~
   This small piece of wood is less than a foot in length in 
total. The entire baton has been crafted from one single piece 
of good stout oakwood, the handle made ridged for better support 
in the hand, and the shaft thin, only an inch in diameter. The 
head has been carved into a wooden ball, although some bumps have 
been made on purpose for extra pain swings. The entire baton is 
charred black, and sanded down, so as not to pass that colouring 
onto the users hands. It is light, and quick for a blunted 
weapon, and has been fire hardened to give it better 
construction. It is a good weapon for close quarters fighting.

A long pole stands here, attached is a banner bearing the White Tree flowing in the wind.~
   This long, wooden pole contains a large, majestic banner upon 
it, as well as a long, iron spear point on it's tip which has

field of black, upon which is the detailed image of the White 
Tree. The tree has been sewn in a brilliant white, and is 
greatly detailed showing a fine hand made this banner. The 
banner and spear point are attached to a thick, wooden pole that 
stands upright on its own, and allows the banner to flow 
spectacularly in the wind. The banner itself is the marking of 
the Gondorian men of the south.

line to the handle. Coming in only a miniscule amount, the head 
then curves back in towards the handle, make the piece of iron 
holding the axe only two inches in height, wrapping around the 
wood handle. This vicious axe is well balanced, and light in the

The main components of sides, back, and chest are still present 
making this still a useable vest, but it creaks with every 
movement and smells badly of mistreated leather. Stitched from 
thick leather, this vest was never designed to stop much more 
than the basic small cuts, and quick stabs.

   This dagger measures a foot and a half long overall with a blade 
length of around a foot, and a quarter-inch thick blade, 
constructed from steel. The hardwood handle is accented with 
brass tang guard and pommel. Someone has attempted to polish the 
tang guard and the brass shows a dull gleam in the light. This 
blade looks well made, but upon close inspection it is obvious 
some shortcuts have been taken in its construction. The blade 
appears shiny at first but impurities within the steel are 
obvious, although still holding a keen edge.

a silver hip flask set with an eagle intaglio~
A silver hip flask has been left here, set with an eagle intaglio.~
   Gleaming silver, polished to a mirrorlike finish makes up this 
small hip flask, which is meant to hold a small quanitity of hard 
liquor. Curved slightly to conform to the shape of a person's 
hip, it sports on its convex side a broad, oval stone of a pale 
blue color, onto which has been intricately etched the figure of 
an eagle, wings spread and talons raised as if in mid-swoop. The 
neck of the flask is very short, being just long enough to hold a 
silver stopper into which has been set a piece of cork that 
firmly seals liquid inside. The stopper is held to the flask by 
means of a short, delicate chain.

a small, iron-bound cedar chest~
A small, iron-bound cedar chest is bolted to the desk here.~
   This chest is fairly small, about a foot long, eight inches 
wide, and six inches deep. Two iron bands wrap around either 
end, and the chest has been fitted with a sturdy iron lock. The 
inside of it has been lined with cheap, black linen, and two 
sturdy iron bolts attach the chest to the desk it sits on, making 
it impossible to remove. Ovarall quite durable in build, this 
chest looks like it will stand up to quite some abuse.

free of imperfections to the eyes. It has been evenly dyed, a

notable, where a large, richly-dyed picture has been embroidered: 
it displays a large wave of water, just barely breaking and 
sending ocean mist spraying. Beneath it is a much smaller 
picture of a silvery-grey sword laid horizontal.

large oak rests in the middle of the painting, a doe eating peacefully
under the spreading branches. In the foreground, to the left side, the
shadowed trunk of a tree can be seen, as if the viewer were peering out
at the meadow from the forest, a little bird resting in the lower branches
just within sight. A small, fluffy rabbit can also just be seen eating
grass near the doe. The technique is educated and sure-handed, and the
canvas is framed in beveled wood, with a hanger to put it on a wall.

   This finely made white marble shelf hangs from two brackets
from a wall. It is simply made, but decorated with beveling and

a white marble floor vase~
A white marble floor vase stands in one corner.~
   Sculpted of veined white marble, this smooth, glossy vase is
larger than usual, big enough to stand on the floor to hold
flowers or whatever else one wishes. It is deep, easily hip-
high to an average human, with a flaring mouth and slightly
bulbous body. Its base is sturdy and circular, flaring out
slightly for balance and support. Though simple of design,
it is accented with rounded edges and a line of embossing
in two bands around its body, giving it an elegant appearance.

A polished silver hairbrush has been left here.~
   This hairbrush is, in total, the length of a man's palm plus half of
another, and its body is made entirely of polished silver. Its handle is
slender and flowing, swelling just a bit near the end to aid in gripping.
Wide and round, the silver head is circled by a thick piping of more 
of that metal, while its back face is etched with delicate, airy designs
suggesting drapery or scarves blowing in the wind. The bristles are soft
but straight and strong, and could likely withstand years of use without
losing their shape.

An ivory mustache comb has been left here.~
   This comb is small and delicately carved, though it seems sturdy and
unlikely to break. Its top is bowed somewhat while the bottom is flat
and set with numerous tines designed to be run through a mustache or
other facial hair. There is a gentle depression in its face to aid in
gripping, and at one end a short tooth extends horizontally for help in 
shaping the edges of whatever is being combed. The craftsmanship is
excellent, and a series of three small mother-of-pearl eyes have been
set through the face for decoration, extending the full length of the comb,
visible from both sides, and equidistant from each other.

A pair of bronze barber shears has been left here.~
   These shears are similar to other tools of their ilk, bearing rings
at one end designed to accommodate even the thickest finger and thumb. 
They are designed specifically for trimming hair and, while they can be
employed to cut other materials, their blades will dull quickly if they
are used improperly. Both edges are sharp and keen, making minor injury
a real danger for the clumsy. Pointed enough to break the skin when
separated, their tips are relatively harmless when brought together in 
the at-rest position.

elegant knife is as asthetically pleasing as it is efficient. Double-
edged, it's polished and whetted blade begins with a series of deep
serrations, only to halt and draw into a flawlessly tapering blade that
extends right to a narrow point at the knife's tip.  Designed to be
efficient in killing, and skinning, this knife's rather wicked appearance
is softened only by the elegant woodland scenes carved into the sturdy,
oak handle.

a decorative canister lantern~
A decorative glass canister lantern is set here.~
   Tall and thin with glass panels, this lantern is both stylish and
effective.  It stands the height of a man's knee and no wider than an
arm, rounded glass sides tapering toward the top and bottom with a slight
rise in the middle.  Capable of sharing light in a great radius, this
lantern is formed of hand-crafted steel etched delicately with wagons,
horses, and scenes of trade; it is masterfully-wrought. A small oil well
at the base leads to a well-fitted wick, and a small lever on the side
allows the flame to be adjusted to appropriate levels. Suitable for home
or travel use, it is nonetheless fragile-looking.

neck and is formed of thick, clear glass.  Capable of holding a
moderately-sized arrangement without dominating a table's surface,
its bowl forms a fair-sized resevoir for water and serves to make it
a bit more sturdy on its flat base.

   Crafted of brilliant, $finecolor glass, this vase has a rounded
reservoir at the bottom capable of holding a large amount of water.
The bowl, set in an elegant nest of glass "ivy" tangling to its
quartet of short legs, allows it to be set securely on almost any
flat surface. The mouth of the vase flares outward to allow for a
large arrangement, the neck tapering a bit.  Extremely delicate, and
exquisitely made, by itself it is an artistic statement.

 This large, circular fountain bubbles, even in winter, with water
coursing down from its central figures. Three men, tall and noble
of bearing, all in armor with weapons drawn, stand together as if
about to face a dreadful foe. Around them are broken and discarded
weapons of war, some recognizably non-human. Despite the violent
sculpture, the fountain is itself exquisitely made of pure white
marble, with gold chasing accenting the vines carved across the
wide, rounded edge of the fountain. One section, to the side, is
left clear enough that people can dip buckets or the like into it
for clean water -- and the water is, indeed, crystal-clear and
freezing cold at all times of the year.

bound in dull, hammered iron. A large lock has been set at the 
chest's lid, thick chains snaking from it to wrap about the domed 
top of the container. The lock itself is rather formidable, and 
seemingly quite heavy. Upon closer inspection, a small sigil has 
been lightly carved into the lock's edge, depicting a key beneath 
the Tengwar 'S' symbol.

Circle estate, accurately modelled to scale. With sweeping architecture
and delicate carvings, the rooms of this estate are inlaid with real
stained-glass for windows, tiny mirrors, and even bits of polished bronze
and tin that pass remarkably as gold and silver.  The rugs are hand-
stitched, and the painting has been lovingly done to add to this detailed
dollhouse's stunning craftsmanship. It is a "toy" for either older people
or for extremely privileged children, painted $color accented with 
complementary paler colors along the trim.

pendant dangles almost in its wearer's cleavage.

well-polished and has only a minor few nicks in it, showing its 
superb quality and resilience. The crossguard is made of simple 
polished broze and is straight, the hilt being a polished 
obsidian wrapped in thick leather for a good grip.

an ornate, gilded teacup~
An ornate, gilded teacup is here.~
   What this teacup lacks in size it easily makes up for in craftsmanship,
the inner surface being utterly smooth and free from notch or blemish,
while the outer surface is carved with an ornate, flowing pattern that
suggests flowing drapery or fresh ivy. It is made of the highest quality
porcelain, shiny with glaze, and rimmed in gleaming gold. Its handle
is delicate and airy, woven from corded-looking porcelain gilded all
along its edges in shiny gold leaf.

an ornate, gilded porcelain tea tray~
An ornate, gilded porcelain tea tray is set here.~
   This rectangular tray is made of shiny, glazed pure white porcelain,
accented around its ornately scrolling edges and handles with gleaming
gold leaf. Its pattern is recognizable to those who are familiar with
such things as the very old, expensive one called Steward's Table,
distinctive because of its swooping edges and ornately corded detailing.
Its circular face bears a masterful, non-representational etching that
is suggestive of flowing drapery or tendrils of fresh ivy.

boots masterfully-embroidered, cream-colored suede LEATHER FIFTHCIRCLE~
a pair of embroidered, cream-colored suede boots~
A pair of masterfully-embroidered, cream-colored suede boots lie here.~
   A work of cobbling perfection, these stunning boots are made of the 
finest, richly colored suede.  Reaching just above the ankle, they are
lined with plush cotton and remarkably comfortable.  Formed to fit the
foot within, and with a slightly pronounced heel, the encourage a natural,
easy gait and posture that suits well for travelling.  The boots, however,
are set in a class of their own by the masterful embroideries stitched
along the suede, trim of sleek silver and snow-white twisting artfully
together along the rounded toe only to race back toward the heel, crossing
several times.  Then, truly a work of art, the solitary line of snow-white
arcs up to etch fluidly a small representation of Gondor's White Tree just
below the fur-trimmed cuff.  Surrounding this, unifying these boots with
their Master's heritage, the silver tails arc about the flawless tree to
encircle it, pronouncing it further from the gentle cream suede, and
marking the cobbler's craft as an art.

A set of strong, pointed iron warhorse shoes are set here.~
   Made in the familiar horseshoe shape, these shoes are thicker and
stronger than normal, with their front edges extending out beyond the
edge of the hoof. The edges are sharpened, making these shoes unsuitable
for everyday use or with horses who are not trained in wearing them.
But for a trained warhorse, they add considerably to the beast's already-
formidable threat.

presentation piece, but very well-tended, the roses many-petaled and
smelling perfumed.

A pewter goblet, set with garnets and onyx stones, rests here.~
   This ornate goblet is cast of pewter, with a bright coating on
its inside bowl to make it safe to drink out of. It's cast with
flowers, roses and jasmine, climbing up its slender central stem,
and its base looks like a bed of soft grass. Set along the top and
base are round-cut garnet cabochons and smaller oval onyx stones,
glinting glossy black against the gunmetal grey of the pewter and
deep red of the garnets. It's a stunning goblet, its workmanship
clearly that of a master.

A cream silk wedding gown lies here.~
   Made of cream-colored silk, this gown is an extravaganza. It is
simple of design, with a fitted bodice and a low, sweetheart neckline.
The bodice is richly adorned with a layer of ecru lace over the silk,
and pearls sewn in designs all it. Like an upside-down flower, its
petals closely cover the waist and hips, but from there, the skirt
flares in unadorned silk to the floor. Its long sleeves end with
pointed tips over the backs of the hands.
