Southern Gatehouse of the Walled Village~
   The battlements above the walled village below have been 
constructed carefully, fashioned from stout tree trunks shaped 
and fire hardened, and carefully proofed against any attack from 
fire. A sweeping view of South Ithilien is visible from high up 
here, the immediate farmlands about the walled village, the Emyn 
Arnen south-west, the Ephel Duath East, and the River Anduin 
west. A boardwalk leads about the rest of the battlements. 
   Here, the wooden structure continues over one's head, a rough 
wooden gatehouse built to grant extra protection to the section 
of the battlements situated over the village gate.

to the middle of the tiny village below. Instead, bordering it 
to the north, east, south and west are the boardwalks of the

allowing one to make their way quickly from one side of the fort

Dirt Path Through the Walled Village~
   This dirt path leads through the small stone and wooden houses 
that have been constructed along it, that house the wealthier 
denizens of the village, or, at least, wealthy compared to the 
poor farmers that labour in the fields outside. A number of 
brightly painted market stalls are arranged at the odd point 
along the road, offering basic services such as smithying and 
tinkering to the populace. To the north, a rope-lashed 
portcullis lies, while to the east a ladder is lain against the 
battlements.

holes and tunnels, allowing anyone stationed above to rain ruin

Town Square of the Tiny Village~
   The crooked path that cuts from south to north through this 
tiny village enlargens here to a dusty town square, filled with 
laughing children and chattering commoners dressed in drab, 
homespun clothing, yet nonetheless look healthy and well fed. 
The buildings in this section of the village are slightly larger 
than those found elsewhere, a prominent building fashioned from 
stone and painted wood set to the south, clearly the house of the 
lord of the fiefdom.

Ramshackle Village Path~
   A ramshackle path cuts from the southern portcullis to deeper 
north inside the tiny village, littered with livestock of all 
sorts and more than the odd wagon as farmers take their wares to 
and from the markets, or to give as tribute to their local lord. 
Underfoot, the path is nothing more than packed dirt, but is kept 
sturdy by the constant stream of villagers that make their way 
along this road and through the gate, or in to their simple 
houses that line in. A thick ladder set against the western 
battlements allows one access up to them.

the walls (and can also see into this yard). It is in the shade

   The bank of Morgulduin is quite barren, no grass grows and 
only the occasional bush or shrub manages to live, though they 
appear to be dying. Few animals can be seen preferring to hide 
from travellers. The bank is occasionally broken though mostly 
it slopes down into the river. The land closest to the water 
mostly consists of pebbles and small rocks.

A Bend in Harad Road South of the River~
   The broad, hard-packed road takes a bend here, following the 
southern banks of the river for a while before turning onto a 
straighter path to the south. To the east, the increasingly 
barren lands slope upward as if to meet the black mountains of 
the Ephel Duath. The lands to the southwest, on the other hand, 
grow greener as they eventually give way to an expanse of 
woodlands.

crosses over a bridge of bones and twisted, thorny brambles 
spanning the pale waters of the River Morgulduin. A few parched 
tufts of grass and weeds sprout out alongside the road near the 
river, their sickly appearance matching the color of the flowing 
waters. Few travelers, if any, can be seen using this road.

Logged Fringe Near the River~
   What once may have been a fringe of light woodlands 
before the foul, flowing waters of the Morgulduin somewhere 
to the north-west is now a plain covered in felled, rotting logs 
and moss-covered tree stumps. The soil is dry, and little wildlife 
moves through the area, the ravaged land and the looming site 
of a fort off to the southwest doing their part is driving any 
natural life away. Large boulders have been thrust up through 
the ground, blocking travel to the east.

North-East of a Fort in the Ithilien Hills~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks.

Harad Road East of A Stone Garrison~
   To the north and south the Harad Road continues on its course 
through the hills and plains of this land. The road is mostly 
packed dirt that has been worn down over the centuries into a 
small ditch compared to the land immediately to either side of 
the road. Grasslands mainly comprise the land around the road 
here, covering the hills in a sea of ripples caused by the wind.
Several large rocks have been thrust up through the ground to 
the west, limiting travel in that direction only by the road
that leads off that way.

Desolate Hills Rising Steeply To The East~
   The ground here is far from flat, rising in waves of hills and 
falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that 
spurts forth from the ground and is accompanied by a clustering 
of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
fields of South Ithilien westward, to the mighty, stark mountain 
face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

Desolate Hills Growing Steeper To The East~
   Travel through these hills is far from easy; the landscape 
climbs and falls, yet uniformly grows more steep and stark as it 
heads east to the towering, shard-like black mountains that mark 
the lands of Mordor. No human habitation is visible this close 
to dark border, but across the west the occasional fortified 
village or isolated farmhouse can be seen.

Open Woodlands~
   The trees are spaced a good distance from one another, their 
boughs only touching in the areas of thickest growth and casting 
occasional shadows upon the ground. A mixture of deciduous trees 
take root here, from solid oaks and graceful maples to catkin- 
bearing alders. Some ferns and low-lying bushes sprout here and 
there, but not so much as to hinder travelers. The woodlands 
dwindle to the east as they give way to drier hills.

Hills West of a Fort~
   The immediate area is covered in small green and brown shrubs 
interspersed with yellowed dying grass as well as green and 
vibrant. The occasionally tree provides shelter and homes for 
the wildlife here and the wind can be heard blowing through the 
hills. Not many travellers can be seen, most preferring the 
safer roads. 
   To the southwest an oak and alder woodland sprouts up in the 
dry Ithilien hills. Travel eastwards is impossible due to several 
large rocks having been thrust upwards through the ground, 
running to the north.

Foothills Marked with the Occasional Farm East of Fortifications~
   A thick growth of low lying bushes roams across the hills of 
South Ithilien that lie between the low lying plains to the west 
and the steep, thrusting, presence of the eastward moutains. 
Small animal life darts amongst the clustered clumps of 
vegetation, as well as the occasional larger predator lurking far 
from the distant plateau to the northwest, or the forest westward.

Barren, Hard-Soiled Foothills~
   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby 
and wiry bushes, and some stretches of pale grass that bows in 
the wind. More often than not, great gusts of air blow down from 
the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the mighty 
Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

Oak and Alder Woodlands~
   The forest here rides a consistent slope downward from east to 
west. Oak and alder trees predominate the area, but here and 
there a coniferous tree shoots skyward, showing only a long, 
resinous trunk devoid of branches. The forest floor is covered 
with brown needles and leaves of seasons past, providing a rich 
base for the array of fragrant plants that make their home near 
the earth.

   Visible betwixt the trunks and branches of the trees is a

thinner than the rest of the woodlands continuing westward. 
Rustling ash trees cast a mottled shade upon the ground, while 
the occasional pine towers over the others. Scattered about are 
patches of wildflowers and many stones.

most common are circles of soaring birds high in the air, 
drifting on the winds that blow across South Ithilien. To the 
west, the vast, dry plains of Gondor's hither lands stretch.

Hilly Terrain Occasionally Marked By Gnarled Trees~
   The ground here is far from flat, rising in waves of hills and 
falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that 
spurts forth from the ground and is accompanied by a clustering 
of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
fields of South Ithilien westward, to the mighty, stark mountain 
face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

Hilly Scrublands West of a Road~
   Here, the ancient forces of wind and rain have caused the 
collapse of one side of a grassy hill. The wild, tough grasses 
of the area have yet to tame the resultant gash of earth that 
shows like a wound in an otherwise grassy sea. However, they 
have conquered the rest of the softly undulating ground here, and 
the vegetation resists the legs of the passing traveler just as 
the hills tax them.

A Bend in Harad Road~
   North and east continues Harad Road in a seemingly endless 
journey over the land, carrying those who travel upon it through 
a variety of terrains. At the moment, barren scrubland are 
bordering the road to the west, as they mark the beginnings of 
the great plain of South Ithilien spreading forth in that 
direction. The eastern horizon is dominated by a constant line 
of black mountains.

mostly made of dirt though occasionally a stone sticks out 
resembling what might have been an ancient cobblestone from times

Harad Road Before a Collapsed Bridge in the Morgulduin~
   The road continues to the north while to the south it crosses 
the pale waters of the Morgulduin over a bridge made of yellowed 
bones and twisted brambles. The banks of the river here are rocky 
and barren, no grass grows beneath the boulders or in the crevices 
that line the side of the water. Seldom can travelers be seen 
using this road, the black peaks of the Ephel Duath rising 
ominously a distance to the east.
 
   A broken crude log gate hangs loosely off to the side of the 
bridge. The twisted and broken remains of a crude wooden tower 
sit up on the opposte bank.

An Arched, Twisted, Bone Bridge Over the River~
   This bridge, once of stone, is now a dark and evil thing. 
Composed of what is obviously bones - human and animal both - it 
rises low over the foul river, bristly with brambles and stinking 
of death and decay. The filth of the very Morgulduin itself has 
been used in its recomposition: both gates remain broken, and its 
tower cracked and caved-in.

Atop of a Squat Wooden Tower Above the Bridge~
   A squat wooden tower is set over the southern shore where the 
stone bridge branches the Morgulduin, allowing the owner of the 
fort set to the south-west in the middle of some fertile 
farmlands to control the passage of traffic between North and 
South Ithilien with ease. The tower is nothing more than a 
square-shaped construction of wood, a thin parapet roughly 
ankle-height running around its length and a sturdy wooden ladder 
leading down to the bridge.

Below the Walls of a Fort~
   Dug from the earth at a shallow depth, this tunnel has been
created by the concerted effort of many shovels, picks and
hands, and holds support thanks to some freshly set wooden 
support. Thanks to considerable effort taken to reach this 
point, the tunnel has managed to delve deep enough to reach
the base of the enemy wall. If the supports were to be 
collapsed, the weight of the fortification would bring the
wall crashing, offering a breach into enemy territory.

in some places has been brushed out the way to reveal a packed

at the far end.
   A large, circular window above the double doors allows light
in during the day, while lanterns upon the walls light the barn at

straight upward into a dark fissure in the tall ceiling. Other

tools visible on the walls.

   Narrow and twisting, one can barely see along this tunnel as 
it winds through the solid stone of the mountains. Spaced 
unevenly along its length are a series of dark burrows, probably 
dwellings of those who inhabit these depths. The air here is in 
constant motion, moaning its way from the east to the south, and 
filled with a choking stench that seems to find a new and 
uniquely vile flavor every several moments. The floor slants 
upward to the south, and the tunnel widens and becomes more even 
to the east.

which angles slickly downward into the darkness along with a flow 
of sewage running through a shallow trench.

A Sloping Cavern of Stinking Muck~
   A slow, but steady trickle of filth and sewage rolls into this 
cavern, both from the west and from several grated holes in the 
walls and ceiling. It collects in a cesspool at the bottom of 
the sloped floor, unbelievable in its odor and wretched in 
appearance. Flies buzz constantly over the bubbling muck, their 
population visible as an ever-churning cloud in the oppressive 
air. Where the floor slopes to the east, a large grate has been 
set into the wall to allow some of the filth to escape its 
imprisonment here. The cavern slopes upward to the west, where 
there is some slight relief from the horrible smell. 
   A rickety building has been hastily constructed to the east, 
the mucky filth running up right to its high, wooden landing.

moving, a ragged breeze rushing past at almost all times. Warm 
and dark, a variety of foul smells can be caught by the nose, 
some of which no doubt issue from the slow trickle of raw sewage

holes, burrows, and tentlike shanties, and the area is almost 
constantly bustling with some sort of activity. The smell in 
here is noxious, a bouquet of stenches arising from each hovel 
and nest that is dug here. Trash strewn in every nook and cranny 
adds to this unpleasant atmosphere, and the floor is slick with 
grease and slime of unnamable composition. The only exit from

Rickety, Foul-Smelling Brothel~
   This crude brothel has been constructed of termite eaten 
wooden planks, rope, bits of bone and even rough, uncut logs. 
Its assembly has been, like the materials used to build it, 
motley and haphazard, with roped together walls, rusted iron 
nails and creaky leaning barrels pushed into corners and propping 
up much larger timbers. The floor, originally wood planked, 
seems to have gone the way of the cesspool outside it and is now 
slimed with filth and the grime of the underwarrens: old meat, 
ragged hides, bits of bone and other, more unsavoury, things. 
Nests have been scattered about near the walls of the 
establishment, where slant-eyed orkish whores cat-call the 
patrons over, their faces gaunt and their bodies wasted. A 
spiralling wooden stairway leads upwards to a second floor, as 
unstable as the first.

   This narrow hallway is only wide enough for two or three small 
goblins to move side-by-side along it, and some of the larger 
orkish patrons go so far as to completely block access from one 
end of the hall to the other with their prodigious bulk. Though 
dim lit, the hall has a distinctly red cast to it and bugs crawl 
along the walls and across the floor. The ruckus of the room 
below filters up from the stairway at all hours.

A Foul-Smelling Room~
   Smelling of the cesspool below, sex, booze, sweat and blood, 
this cramped room would be a rather uncomfortable place to spend 
any length of time. Barren but for a crude nest in the center of 
the room, it is dim lit and windowless, dank and rather warm even 
in the coolest weather.

Beneath the Grate~
   A tunnel has been dug straight down into the rock, leaving 
only a short ledge along its eastern side, and continues down 
into darkness. Far below the sound of running water can be 
heard, along with at times much more inhuman, alien sounds: 
brays, snarls, the undulating howl of some rabid beast.

A Roughly Dug-out Common Room~
   This curious common room has been dug out of the ground 
noticeably quickly. The walls have been lined with thick wooden 
planks, and wide iron beams support the ceiling. The area is in 
poor decor due to its rushed construction and is rather poorly 
lit, only by a few dull lanterns.

A Wooden-Framed Narrow Hallway~
   The walkway here is made up only of a few narrow sheets of 
wood to cover the damp dirt. The walls are solid, however not 
completely covered. Lines of support beams are closely packed 
together to support it from collapsing. The hall is dully lit by 
two lanterns hanging precariously overhead.

A Damp, Dark Meeting Room~
   This rather small room is circular in shape. It is rather 
well constructed, much more than the area near it. On the 
ceiling starting in the middle of the room the White Tree of 
Gondor has been drawn into the supporting roof. A series of 
thick, circular beams have been placed along the outskirts of the 
room perfectly distanced from each other.

A Poorly-lit, Mud-filled Culd-E-Sac~
   This room has been roughly crafted and dug-out lopsided, with 
only a single support beam to keep the room from collapsing. The 
ground is dug deeper than the entrance and is filled with about a 
foot and a half of substantially watery mud. Only a slight, four 
foot long rise along the southern wall stands above the muddy 
water.

A Wide Musky Sleeping Area~
   This room is very wide and very long. Easily a couple hundred 
yards long and wide. Many thick woolen mats filled with cotton 
are strewn about on the ground, purposes for sleeping on. The 
ceiling and walls are supported by a very numerous amount of 
steel beams. The area is very dimly lit and it is difficult to 
see the closer to the ground you look.

Wind-Swept, Rocky Base of the Ephel Duath~
   Wind constantly howls down through the notches and gaps in the 
jagged peaks of the black mountains of Mordor that rise from the 
ground to the east, a short run of increasingly rocky and steep 
terrain rising up to them. Along with the wind comes the smell 
of something old, a chill presence and the occasional fine dust 
of soot.

Desolate Hills Rising Steeply To The East~
   Travel through these hills is difficult at best; the landscape 
climbs in ragged steps with deep falls, yet uniformly grows more 
steep and stark as it heads east to the towering, shard-like 
black mountains that mark the lands of Mordor. No human 
habitation is visible this close to dark border, but towards the 
west a tall, stone fort can be seen.

Harad Road Northeast of A Tall Stone Garrison~
   To the north and south the Harad Road continues on its course 
through the hills and plains of this land. The road is mostly 
packed dirt that has been worn down over the centuries into a 
small ditch compared to the land immediately to either side of 
the road. Grasslands mainly comprise the land around the road 
here, covering the hills in a sea of ripples caused by the wind. 
Several large rocks have been thrust up through the ground to the 
west, limiting travel in that direction only through a small gap 
that leads off that way.
