Base Room for the Wetlands~
This is the baseroom for the area of the Nindalf (Wetwang) and
Marshes of the Dead. Don't modify things without asking first.

Needless to say, the Marsh of the Dead is a scary place. Players
will die if they screw about and go tredging through the swamp.

Room listings: 12000-12300, swampy Ithiien.
12300-12500, Marsh of the Dead
12500-12700, Nindalf, Wetwang
12700-12900, Dagorlad
12900+ not used, except for miscellaneous stuff.

There will be lots of gaps in those numbers, but I'm organising it
thusly to better fit my maps of the area.

Putrid Water of the Swamp~
   Progress through this area is difficult, to say the least - 
the high pitch black water of the swamp forces a wading motion, 
and the sticky mud beneath the surface further hindering the 
process. A putrid stench, repellent to all but those of the 
strongest stomachs, rises insidiously from the stagnant waters, 
its brackish aroma somewhat akin to rotted flesh and flora. The 
only partial escape from the waters lies to the east, south and 
west leading deeper into the depths of the marsh. 
   The mighty mountain range of the Emyn Muil lie to the north, 
the northern border of the marsh as the outlying hills quickly 
rise up from the dark depths. To the east, the barren and 
inhospitable plains of the Dagorlad lie, the bleak wastelands 
stretching out as far as the eye can see.

In The Swamp Off The Western Trail~
   Inky black water, thick with mud and other foul substances, 
oozes forth from the slippery bank of slick earth from the west. 
No current pushes the water, instead its surface is like a flat 
of black glass, save until movement in the dank liquid sends 
spreading ripples across it. Ever present in the air is a 
dismal, diminishing stillness, the bleak colours and shapes of 
the swamp at times seemingly smothering. The waters continue to 
the south and east.

Path Leading North Into The Mountains And South Into The Marsh~
   A thin, winding trail leads through the swamp here, little 
more than clumps and tufts of ground that is soft underfoot. At 
the edges of the narrow path the terrain quickly becomes less 
secure, stagnant water pooling about the borders of this 
convoluted passage through the swamps. Wide enough only to allow 
for a single person, the trail stretches indefinitely to the 
north and south, caution required in progressing along the path 
to avoid slipping into the brackish water.

Waist-Heigh Brackish Water~
   Still water spreads silently throughout the area here, 
reaching up to the waist of a full grown man in some places. The 
ground beneath the pitch black surface is far from flat, instead 
rising and falling with little order or pattern. Regardless of 
the depth, the thick mud clings to anything that touches it, and 
many strange shapes brush against ones legs and feet when moving 
through these turgid waters. To the west the water continues on, 
while a sharp incline lies to south and east.

In The Deep Waters of the Marsh~
   All but the tallest of creatures are forced to tread the dark, 
dismal waters of the marsh here, lest they fall beneath the 
surface and into the muddy, foul-smelling liquid. Black trees 
rise up at odd intervals, breaking the still surface of the 
stagnant water, the trunks encrusted with slippery moss. In all 
directions the putrid waters continue, offering little escape 
from their chill embrace. 
   The mighty mountain range of the Emyn Muil lie to the north,

can be seen, however, to the north.

Narrow Path Leading South Into The Swamp And North Into The Mountains~
   In all directions the dark waters of the marsh lay still, the 
surface of the swamp broken by an occasional moss-marked tree and 
the twisting path of ground that cuts through the turgid mud and 
decrepit flora. Rough and uneven, the trail is formed of rock 
and raised earth, the edges quickly sloping down into thick mud 
and brackish waters. Leading from north to south, it passes by 
the forlorn nature of the marsh, allowing an unparalleled view of 
the marsh, the oppressive silence that hangs easily over it.

Soggy Swamp Island~
   This tiny island is made up of wet, bog-like ground that 
clings to anything it touches. A scattering of black weeds 
erupting in the occasional tuft from the soggy soil is the only 
vegetation here, the cool, dark waters of the swamp resting at 
the muddy shores evidently doing little to support more growth. 
A pervading stillness hangs over the air, and from the isle the 
stagnant marsh and its spread to the south and east is in full 
view. 
   The mighty mountain range of the Emyn Muil lie to the north,

drab-black of the Marshes lingering to a halt.

sturdy for extended travel, the ground firm and free from the 
foul waters that spread outwards from the edge of the makeshift 
path. Dark, skeletal plants grow wildly along the trail, rising 
up a few feet to the sky in a crooked fashion while in the 
distance a sporadic scattering of rotting carcasses of gigantic 
trees puncture the bleak, grey surface of the marsh. To east and 
south, the trail quickly slips into stagnant water.

Sharp Twist To The East And South In The Trail~
   A foul, acrid smell of rotting flora and stagnant water 
pervades the area, the putrid stench wafting from the inky black 
waters of the marsh that lay in the north and the west. Only the 
narrow trail leading east and south offers refuge from slipping 
into the thick mud and beneath the surface of the marsh, the 
raised ground leading an erratic path about many smaller puddles 
and pools of filth and mire. Desperate plants huddle about the 
trail, as dark and despondent as the rest of the swamp.

   Inky black water, thick with mud and other foul substances, 
oozes forth from the slippery bank of slick earth from the south

like a flat of black glass, save until movement in the dank 
liquid sends spreading ripples across it. Ever present in the 
air is a dismal, diminishing stillness, the bleak colours and 
shapes of the swamp at times seemingly smothering. The waters 
continue to the north and west.

Deep Waters Approaching an Island in the Swamp~
   All but the tallest of creatures are forced to tread the dark, 
dismal waters of the marsh here, lest they fall beneath the 
surface and into the muddy, foul-smelling liquid. Black trees 
rise up at odd intervals, breaking the still surface of the 
stagnant water, the trunks encrusted with slippery moss. In all 
directions the putrid waters continue, offering little escape 
from their chill embrace. 
   To the north, a steep bank gives way to an island amidst the 
dark waters of the swamp. 
   To the west, the waters grow less bleak and dismal, the flora
of the wetlands showing hints of greens and browns, the
drab-black of the Marshes lingering to a halt.

Water Covered Quagmire~
   Dark, foul smelling water rises up several feet here, the 
surface still save for the disturbances of any wind or rain that 
may fall from above. Movement through this swampy terrain is 
difficult at best, the thick mud at the bottom weakly giving way 
upon any downwards pressure. The occasional twisted tree sprouts 
forth from beneath the surface of the marsh, its leafless limbs 
stretching high into the sky. To the north and west, the water 
continues onwards, but to travel south or east leads to 
relatively dry ground that emerges from the marsh. 
   To the east, the barren and inhospitable plains of the
Dagorlad lie, the bleak wastelands stretching out as far as the
eye can see.

Oozing Swampland~
   Still water spreads silently throughout the area here, 
reaching up to the waist of a full grown man in some places. The 
ground beneath the pitch black surface is far from flat, instead 
rising and falling with little order or pattern. Regardless of 
the depth, the thick mud clings to anything that touches it, and 
many strange shapes brush against ones legs and feet when moving 
through these turgid waters. To the north, east and west the 
water continues on, while a sharp incline lies to the south.

Marshland South And West Of A Trail~
   Progress through this area is difficult, to say the least - 
the high pitch black water of the swamp forces a wading motion, 
and the sticky mud beneath the surface further hindering the 
process. A putrid stench, repellent to all but those of the 
strongest stomachs, rises insidiously from the stagnant waters, 
its brackish aroma somewhat akin to rotted flesh and flora. The 
only partial escape from the waters lies to the north and west, 
east and south leading deeper into the depths of the marsh.

Dank Trail Branching North, South And West~
   A foul, acrid smell of rotting flora and stagnant water 
pervades the area, the putrid stench wafting from the inky black 
waters of the marsh that lay to the east. Only the narrow trail 
branching to the north, south and west offers refuge from 
slipping into the thick mud and beneath the surface of the marsh, 
the raised ground leading an erratic path about many smaller 
puddles and pools of filth and mire. Desperate plants huddle 
about the trail, as dark and despondent as the rest of the swamp.

Eastward Leading Path Before A Ramshackle Hut~
   In all directions the dark waters of the marsh lay still, the 
surface of the swamp broken by an occasional moss-marked tree and 
the twisting path of ground that cuts through the turgid mud and 
decrepit flora. Rough and uneven, the trail is formed of rock 
and raised earth, the edges quickly sloping down into thick mud 
and brackish waters. Leading from the east to come to a stop 
here, it passes by the forlorn nature of the marsh, allowing an 
unparalleled view of the marsh, the oppressive silence that hangs 
easily over it. 
   At the end of the trail a ramshackle hut constructed from 
crude planks of rotting wood lies, its uneven door hanging loose 
from the hinges. Far to the north, the dim outline of some 
ancient ruins could be seen.

more than clumps and tufts of ground that is soft underfoot. At 
the edges of the narrow path the terrain quickly becomes less 
secure, stagnant water pooling about the borders of this

for a single person, the trail stretches northwards from here and 
seems to turn westwards, but disappears among the brackish waters 
until. Caution is required here, else travellers risk slipping 
into the murky pools.

sturdy for extended travel, the ground firm and free from the 
foul waters that spread outwards from the edge of the makeshift 
path. Dark, skeletal plants grow wildly along the trail, rising 
up a few feet to the sky in a crooked fashion while in the 
distance a sporadic scattering of rotting carcasses of gigantic 
trees puncture the bleak, grey surface of the marsh. To the 
south, west and north, the trail quickly slips into stagnant 
water.

In The Midst Of The Black Waters~
   Inky black water, thick with mud and other foul substances, 
oozes forth from the slippery bank of slick earth from the east. 
No current pushes the water, instead its surface is like a flat 
of black glass, save until movement in the dank liquid sends 
spreading ripples across it. Ever present in the air is a 
dismal, diminishing stillness, the bleak colours and shapes of 
the swamp at times seemingly smothering. The waters continue to 
north, south and west. 
   To the west, the waters grow less bleak and dismal, the flora
of the wetlands showing hints of greens and browns, the
drab-black of the Marshes lingering to a halt.

Isolated Isle of Boggy Land~
   This isle of land is rather large, the soft ground extending 
up from the dark, still waters of the swamp that borders it on 
all sides. Despite the soggy nature of the terrain here, a 
single row of upright, rectangular stones, most half buried in 
the ground, runs across the width of the isle. Faint carvings 
upon the white rock is visible only after close examination, the 
march of years spent is the dismal swamp having eradicated the 
engravings for all of time. Black weeds run rampant across the 
charcoal mud at the shore of this isle, this twisted flora 
quickly slipping beneath the glassy surface of the water that 
extends in all directions.

All but the tallest of creatures are forced to tread the dark,
dismal waters of the marsh here, lest they fall beneath the
surface and into the muddy, foul-smelling liquid. Black trees
rise up at odd intervals, breaking the still surface of the
stagnant water, the trunks encrusted with slippery moss. In all

from their chill embrace.
   To the west, the waters grow less bleak and dismal, the flora
of the wetlands showing hints of greens and browns, the
drab-black of the Marshes lingering to a halt.

Errant Trail Twisting East To West~
   In all directions the dark waters of the marsh lay still, the 
surface of the swamp broken by an occasional moss-marked tree and 
the twisting path of ground that cuts through the turgid mud and 
decrepit flora. Rough and uneven, the trail is formed of rock 
and raised earth, the edges quickly sloping down into thick mud 
and brackish waters. Leading from east to west, it passes by the 
forlorn nature of the marsh, allowing an unparalleled view of the 
marsh, the oppressive silence that hangs easily over it.

Trail Leading North, East And West Past A Pair Of Large Rocks~
   From north to east to west, the terrain of the marsh is 
sufficiently sturdy for extended travel, the ground firm and free 
from the foul waters that spread outwards from the edge of the 
makeshift path. Dark, skeletal plants grow wildly along the 
trail, rising up a few feet to the sky in a crooked fashion while 
in the distance a sporadic scattering of rotting carcasses of 
gigantic trees puncture the bleak, grey surface of the marsh. To 
the south and ,and quickly so, the trail quickly slips into 
stagnant water. 
   Two large rocks, covered in dark weeds and grey fungus, lurch 
from the southern end of the trail here, diverting it to head to 
the east and west.

Still, Black waters South Of An Isle~
   Inky black water, thick with mud and other foul substances, 
oozes forth from the slippery bank of slick earth from the east, 
south and west. No current pushes the water, instead its surface 
is like a flat of black glass, save until movement in the dank 
liquid sends spreading ripples across it. Ever present in the 
air is a dismal, diminishing stillness, the bleak colours and 
shapes of the swamp at times seemingly smothering. The waters 
continue to to north-east and north-west, bog land rising from 
the surface northwards.

   Dark, foul smelling water rises up several feet here, the 
surface still save for the disturbances of any wind or rain that

difficult at best, the thick mud at the bottom weakly giving way 
upon any downwards pressure. The occasional twisted tree sprouts 
forth from beneath the surface of the marsh, its leafless limbs 
stretching high into the sky. To the north and the west, the

ground emerges from the marsh.

   Still water spreads silently throughout the area here, 
reaching up to the waist of a full grown man in some places. The

rising and falling with little order or pattern. Regardless of

many strange shapes brush against ones legs and feet when moving 
through these turgid waters. To the north, east and west the 
water continues on, while a sharp incline lies to the south. 
   To the west, the waters grow less bleak and dismal, the flora
of the wetlands showing hints of greens and browns, the
drab-black of the Marshes lingering to a halt.

Waist Deep Water In The Silent Marshes~
   Progress through this area is difficult, to say the least - 
the high pitch black water of the swamp forces a wading motion, 
and the sticky mud beneath the surface further hindering the 
process. A putrid stench, repellent to all but those of the 
strongest stomachs, rises insidiously from the stagnant waters, 
its brackish aroma somewhat akin to rotted flesh and flora. The 
only partial escape from the waters lies to the north, east, 
south and west leading deeper into the depths of the marsh.

A Stagnant Pool Of Water~
   Dark, foul smelling water rises up several feet here, the 
surface still save for the disturbances of any wind or rain that 
may fall from above. Movement through this swampy terrain is 
difficult at best, the thick mud at the bottom weakly giving way 
upon any downwards pressure. The occasional twisted tree sprouts 
forth from beneath the surface of the marsh, its leafless limbs 
stretching high into the sky. Southwards, the water continues 
onwards, but to the north, east and west relatively dry ground 
emerges from the marsh.

Crooked Path Running North And South~
   A foul, acrid smell of rotting flora and stagnant water 
pervades the area, the putrid stench wafting from the inky black 
waters of the marsh that lay in the east and west. Only the 
narrow trail leading north and south offers refuge from slipping 
into the thick mud and beneath the surface of the marsh, the 
raised ground leading an erratic path about many smaller puddles 
and pools of filth and mire. Desperate plants huddle about the 
trail, as dark and despondent as the rest of the swamp.

Corner Of A Stagnant Pool In The Swamp~
   Inky black water, thick with mud and other foul substances, 
oozes forth from the slippery bank of slick earth from the east 
and south. No current pushes the water, instead its surface is 
like a flat of black glass, save until movement in the dank 
liquid sends spreading ripples across it. Ever present in the 
air is a dismal, diminishing stillness, the bleak colours and 
shapes of the swamp at times seemingly smothering. The waters 
continue to the north and west.

A Narrow Pool Between Two Paths~
   Still water spreads silently throughout the area here, 
reaching up to the waist of a full grown man in some places. The 
ground beneath the pitch black surface is far from flat, instead 
rising and falling with little order or pattern. Regardless of 
the depth, the thick mud clings to anything that touches it, and 
many strange shapes brush against ones legs and feet when moving 
through these turgid waters. To the east and west the water 
continues on, while a sharp incline lies to both the north and 
south.

Waist Deep Swamp Water ~
   Progress through this area is difficult, to say the least - 
the high pitch black water of the swamp forces a wading motion,

its brackish aroma somewhat akin to rotted flesh and flora. The 
only partial escape from the waters lies to the north, east, 
south and west leading deeper into the depths of the marsh.

   To the west, the waters grow less bleak and dismal, the flora
of the wetlands showing hints of greens and browns, the
drab-black of the Marshes lingering to a halt.

   In all directions the dark waters of the marsh lay still, the 
surface of the swamp broken by an occasional moss-marked tree and 
the twisting path of ground that cuts through the turgid mud and 
decrepit flora. Rough and uneven, the trail is formed of rock 
and raised earth, the edges quickly sloping down into thick mud 
and brackish waters. Leading from the north to come to a halt 
southwards, it passes by the forlorn nature of the marsh, 
allowing an unparalleled view of the marsh, the oppressive 
silence that hangs easily over it.

Trail Leading North And West Through The Swamp~
   A thin, winding trail leads through the swamp here, little 
more than clumps and tufts of ground that is soft underfoot. At 
the edges of the narrow path the terrain quickly becomes less 
secure, stagnant water pooling about the borders of this 
convoluted passage through the swamps. Wide enough only to allow 
for a single person, the trail stretches indefinitely to the 
north and west, caution required in progressing along the path to 
avoid slipping into the brackish water.

Weed-Lined Trail Leading East And West~
   From east to west, the terrain of the marsh is sufficiently 
sturdy for extended travel, the ground firm and free from the 
foul waters that spread outwards from the edge of the makeshift 
path. Dark, skeletal plants grow wildly along the trail, rising 
up a few feet to the sky in a crooked fashion while in the 
distance a sporadic scattering of rotting carcasses of gigantic 
trees puncture the bleak, grey surface of the marsh. To the 
north and south, the trail quickly slips into stagnant water.

Deep, Dark, Chill Waters In The Middle Of The Marsh~
   All but the tallest of creatures are forced to tread the dark, 
dismal waters of the marsh here, lest they fall beneath the 
surface and into the muddy, foul-smelling liquid. Black trees 
rise up at odd intervals, breaking the still surface of the 
stagnant water, the trunks encrusted with slippery moss. In all

Fallen Tree at Trails Leading North and South~
   A thin, winding trail leads through the swamp here, little 
more than clumps and tufts of ground that is soft underfoot. At 
the edges of the narrow path the terrain quickly becomes less 
secure, stagnant water pooling about the borders of this 
convoluted passage through the swamps. Wide enough only to allow 
for a single person, the trail stretches indefinitely to the 
north, south and west, caution required in progressing along the 
path to avoid slipping into the brackish water. 
   A gigantic tree trunk lies across the south-western edge of 
the trail, splitting its progression from the north into two 
narrow paths leading west and south.

Dismal Path Stretching East And West~
   From east to west, the terrain of the marsh is sufficiently 
sturdy for extended travel, the ground firm and free from the 
foul waters that spread outwards from the edge of the makeshift 
path. Dark, skeletal plants grow wildly along the trail, rising 
up a few feet to the sky in a crooked fashion while in the 
distance a sporadic scattering of rotting carcasses of gigantic 
trees puncture the bleak, grey surface of the marsh. To the 
north and south, the trail quickly slips into stagnant water.

East to West On The Path~
   In all directions the dark waters of the marsh lay still, the 
surface of the swamp broken by an occasional moss-marked tree and 
the twisting path of ground that cuts through the turgid mud and 
decrepit flora. Rough and uneven, the trail is formed of rock 
and raised earth, the edges quickly sloping down into thick mud 
and brackish waters. Leading from east to west, it passes by the 
forlorn nature of the marsh, allowing an unparalleled view of the 
marsh, the oppressive silence that hangs easily over it. 
   To the west, the waters grow less bleak and dismal, the flora
of the wetlands showing hints of greens and browns, the
drab-black of the Marshes lingering to a halt.

Amongst The Chill Waters Of The Swamp~
   Still water spreads silently throughout the area here, 
reaching up to the waist of a full grown man in some places. The 
ground beneath the pitch black surface is far from flat, instead 
rising and falling with little order or pattern. Regardless of 
the depth, the thick mud clings to anything that touches it, and 
many strange shapes brush against ones legs and feet when moving 
through these turgid waters. To the south and west the water 
continues on, while a sharp incline lies to the north and east. 
   To the east, the barren and inhospitable plains of the
Dagorlad lie, the bleak wastelands stretching out as far as the
eye can see.

Filth-Ridden Pool Of Swamp Water~
   Progress through this area is difficult, to say the least - 
the high pitch black water of the swamp forces a wading motion, 
and the sticky mud beneath the surface further hindering the 
process. A putrid stench, repellent to all but those of the 
strongest stomachs, rises insidiously from the stagnant waters, 
its brackish aroma somewhat akin to rotted flesh and flora. The 
only partial escape from the waters lies to the north and west, 
progress to the east or south leading deeper into the depths of 
the marsh.

   A foul, acrid smell of rotting flora and stagnant water 
pervades the area, the putrid stench wafting from the inky black 
waters of the marsh that lay to the north. Only the narrow trail 
leading west, south and east offers refuge from slipping into the 
thick mud and beneath the surface of the marsh, the raised ground 
leading an erratic path about many smaller puddles and pools of 
filth and mire. Desperate plants huddle about the trail, as dark 
and despondent as the rest of the swamp.

In The Dismal, Dank Marsh~
   Inky black water, thick with mud and other foul substances, 
oozes forth from the slippery bank of slick earth from the south. 
No current pushes the water, instead its surface is like a flat 
of black glass, save until movement in the dank liquid sends 
spreading ripples across it. Ever present in the air is a 
dismal, diminishing stillness, the bleak colours and shapes of 
the swamp at times seemingly smothering. The waters continue to 
the north, east and west.

   Dark, foul smelling water rises up several feet here, the 
surface still save for the disturbances of any wind or rain that 
may fall from above. Movement through this swampy terrain is 
difficult at best, the thick mud at the bottom weakly giving way 
upon any downwards pressure. The occasional twisted tree sprouts 
forth from beneath the surface of the marsh, its leafless limbs 
stretching high into the sky. North, east and west, the water 
continues onwards, but to the south relatively dry ground emerges 
from the marsh.

Dank, Chill And Dark Swamp Water~
   Inky black water, thick with mud and other foul substances, 
oozes forth from the slippery bank of slick earth from the east 
and south. No current pushes the water, instead its surface is 
like a flat of black glass, save until movement in the dank 
liquid sends spreading ripples across it. Ever present in the 
air is a dismal, diminishing stillness, the bleak colours and 
shapes of the swamp at times seemingly smothering. The waters 
continue to north and west. 
   To the east, the barren and inhospitable plains of the
Dagorlad lie, the bleak wastelands stretching out as far as the
eye can see.

Waist-Heigh Waters In The Marsh~
   Dark, foul smelling water rises up several feet here, the 
surface still save for the disturbances of any wind or rain that 
may fall from above. Movement through this swampy terrain is 
difficult at best, the thick mud at the bottom weakly giving way 
upon any downwards pressure. The occasional twisted tree sprouts 
forth from beneath the surface of the marsh, its leafless limbs 
stretching high into the sky. To the north, east and west, the 
water continues onwards, but to the south relatively dry ground 
emerges from the marsh.

Still, Silent Swamp East Of A Raised Bank~
   Still water spreads silently throughout the area here, 
reaching up to the waist of a full grown man in some places. The 
ground beneath the pitch black surface is far from flat, instead 
rising and falling with little order or pattern. Regardless of 
the depth, the thick mud clings to anything that touches it, and 
many strange shapes brush against ones legs and feet when moving 
through these turgid waters. To the north and east the water 
continues on, while a sharp incline lies to the south and west.

A Path At The Entrace Of The Swamp, Leading North~
   From the north to south, the terrain of the marsh is 
sufficiently sturdy for extended travel, the ground firm and free 
from the foul waters that spread outwards from the edge of the 
makeshift path. Dark, skeletal plants grow wildly along the 
trail, rising up a few feet to the sky in a crooked fashion while 
in the distance a sporadic scattering of rotting carcasses of 
gigantic trees puncture the bleak, grey surface of the marsh. To 
the east and the west, the trail quickly slips into 
stagnant water. 
   Southwards, the path rises out from the swamp, leading into
a boggy heathland.

Damp Trail Leading North Into A Dismal Swamp~
A foul, acrid smell of rotting flora and stagnant water pervades
the area, the putrid stench wafting from the inky black waters
of the marsh that lay in the east and the west. Only the
narrow trail leading north and south offers refuge
from slipping into the thick mud and beneath the surface of the
marsh, the raised ground leading an erratic path about many smaller
puddles and pools of filth and mire. Desperate plants huddle about
the trail, as dark and despondent as the rest of the swamp.
   Southwards, the trail leads out into the boggy ground of
the far North Ithilien.

and the sticky mud beneath the surface further hindering the 
process. A putrid stench, repellent to all but those of the

its brackish aroma somewhat akin to rotted flesh and flora. The 
only partial escape from the waters lies to north, east and 
south, only westward leading deeper into the depths of the marsh.

Dark, Dank Burrow~
   What may have once been a chamber of regular proportions, 
hacked away from the earth, has degenerated into a egg-shaped 
burrow, the confines the somewhat damp dark soil from which 
emanates a foul stench much akin to the rot of flesh. Pale roots 
jut out from the earthen walls, while numerous human bones 
half-buried in a mixture of mud and moss make up the ground of 
their awkward cavern. Standing upright beneath the ground here 
is impossible, those gathered in this wide space forced to crouch 
and kneel to accommodate the low height of the dirt ceiling. A 
small hole is situated in the center of this burrow.

Inside A Ramshackle Hut~
   Warped and gnarled planks of a dark, near-fetid wood have been 
propped against one another to form this crude, ramshackle hut, 
doing little but keep the worst of the weather from one's head. 
The pervading stench of stagnant, foul waters wafts in 
effortlessly through the cracks in the exterior of this tiny 
cottage, and east through the battered door the vast expanse of 
the marshes can be seen. The black, damp ground is covered with 
a light scattering of ancient straw, while the corner of the hut 
are ruled by vast networks of cobwebs.

Narrow Cleft Beneath Two Large Stones~
   Barely large enough for more than one person, this cleft is 
far from a natural formation - the rough-surfaced yet straight 
cuts into the two large stones that form this hollow, combined 
with flakes of the dark stone littering the rocky base, prove the 
artificial nature of this gap. Despite this, the close proximity 
of the two stones, wrapped in acrid smelling weeds and dried 
moss, forces those in the cleft into a hunched position. Passage 
out of this confined location is granted only by a narrow gap 
between the two rocks, with many scrapes and bruises likely to be 
gained passing through it.

Amidst the Skeletal Branches Of a Gigantic Tree~
   A large nook has been formed on this bloated, black tree where 
the trunk splits off into a half-dozen thick branches, arcing 
outwards in a malignant fashion. The gnarls and snags of the 
tree allows for a small number of people to sit and stand in this 
cranny of the gigantic tree, and commands a surpassing view of 
the stagnant marshes that spread in every direction. To the 
south a trail runs pass the base of the gigantic tree, a somewhat 
precarious leap down leading to it.

Upon The Walls Inside The Thick Tree Trunk~
   A dank, musty stench emanates from the black wood of this 
hollowed out tree, thick dust hanging still and silent in the 
air. A set of small hand grips cut into the wood allows one to 
pull themselves up or descend down through this ancient and 
gigantic tree, the climb treacherous due to the moss, mold and 
other gunk wedged in between the cutouts. Bugs of all shapes and 
sizes flit about with tiny wings or crawl with countless up and 
down the length of the trunk. At the bottom of the climb only 
darkness awaits, while a hole exiting out of the haggard tree is 
visible at the top of the hand grips.

with a still silence, the only natural sounds here the echoes of 
the wind filtering from the large, dark hole in the centre of 
this refuge. Irregular shaped rocks litter the dirt, interspread 
between bones and charcoal, a small pit dug out to one side of 
the cavern.

man-sized creatures to move through with only a minimum of a 
hunch. The wood that forms the roof and walls of this long 
tree-trunk is tough and jagged, easily leaving splinters to stray 
hands and feet. A virulent moss grows unabated throughout the 
trunk, a damp, rotting smell assailing the nostrils, the dark 
colour of the mould offset by vivid white fungi. At either end 
of this tree trunk a wide opening offers passage back outside to 
the turgid marsh.

Deep, Murky Waters In The Swamp~
   The brown, cool waters of the swamp are deep, with no firm 
ground for even the tallest of beings to stand upon and keep 
their head above the surface. Below the illy and reed covered 
waters, gnarled roots twist and twine, snaking along the slippery 
mud bottom of the swamp. In all directions one can wade through 
the mostly still waters to higher ground in the wetlands, 
progressing under the canopy of interwoven tree branches. 
   To the east, the towering trees and sprouting flora thins, the 
terrain swiftly turning bleak, dank and dismal, while to the 
north the waters of the swamp thin out as the stalwart Emyn Muil, 
the mountain range that marks the northern border of the 
Ithilien, rises up from the landscape.

   A languid current runs through the dark waters of the swamp, 
the surface roughly where the waist of a man's would be. Leafy 
litter rests gently upon the top of the waters, while underneath 
movement can be felt through the swamp at odd intervals. The 
bottom of the wetlands is soft mud that clings to anything it 
touches, as well as the thick roots of the large trees that grow 
from the dark water. In all directions the swamp continues, yet 
to the west a narrow path rises from the surface of the waters.

Trail Leading Northwards Into The Mountains, South To The Swamp~
   This slender trail leads to the north and south, marking a 
path through the large, moss-encrusted trees and expansive 
bushes. The trail quickly slips under the dark brown waters of 
the swamp that clusters either side of the trail, a web of weeds 
and plant life roaming across its surface. The occasional rock 
juts from the path, breaking free from the strangle of vines that 
grips the dirt, forcing one to tread warily as they progress 
through the swamp. 
   The trail through the swamp climbs the slopes and foothills 
that lies before the Emyn Muil, the stalwart mountain range that 
marks the northern border of the Ithilien.

Through The Shallow Swamp Waters~
   Travel to the south and west requires one to move through the 
waist deep waters of the swamp, the cool liquid still save for a 
meagre current. Plants and trees grow in abundance in the 
waters, from the network of lilies and weeds across the surface 
to the massive cypress trees, their roots submerged but their 
dark trunks and branches towering high overhead. The 'knees' of 
the cypress trees are spread throughout the area, the knobbly 
protrusions a hazard to those careless in their movement through 
the swamp.

Brown Waters Bordering A Path To The West And South~
   Dark brown water, rather cool in temprature, rises up 
waist-heigh in this section of the swamps. Upon the surface a 
blanket of weeds, lillies, reeds and other small plants stretch 
across the boundries of the swamp, set in varying shades of green 
and brown. Luminous fungi and grey moss cluster at the bases of 
the giant cypress and willows trees that lurch out of the waters, 
reaching high into the sky only to have their branches trail down 
again. To the north and east, the swamp continues, while a path 
lies to the west and south.

Trail Leading South Into The Swamp, North Into The Mountains~
   This slender trail leads to the north and south, marking a 
path through the large, moss-encrusted trees and expansive 
bushes. The trail quickly slips under the dark brown waters of 
the swamp that clusters either side of the trail, a web of weeds 
and plantlife roaming across its surface. The occasional rock 
juts from the path, breaking free from the strangle of vines that 
grips the dirt, forcing one to tread warily as they progress 
through the swamp. 
  The trail through the swamp climbs the slopes and foothills 
that lies before the Emyn Muil, the stalwart mountain range that 
marks the northern border of the Ithilien.

Dark Waters Of The Swamp~
   As far as the eye can see in this dank, humid swamp, giant 
trees sprout from the dark brown waters, their trunks encased in 
moss and fungi. Numerous willow trees emerge from the surface of 
the swamp, their slender, drooping branches reaching back down to 
the chill waters, each bearing a wizened beauty about it. 
Countless other species of flora grow with abandon above and 
below the water, with fish and insects eagerly feeding off some. 
To the east, a slender trail lies, providing dry passage through 
the swamp.

cypress and willow trees gathered in the swamp. Brown waters lap 
at the edge of the trail, the ground descending sharply past the 
brim of the weed-wreathe surface of the swamp. The occasional 
coarse bird call punctures the otherwise pregnant silence here, 
often followed by a sighting of brown and black wings through the 
maze of trees. Insects of all description roam freely, buzzing 
in the air and floating across the waters of the swamp.

save for a meagre current. Plants and trees grow in abundance in 
the waters, from the network of lilies and weeds across the 
surface to the massive cypress trees, their roots submerged but 
their dark trunks and branches towering high overhead. The 
'knees' of the cypress trees are spread throughout the area, the 
knobbly protrusions a hazard to those careless in their movement 
through the swamp.

all about, quickly descending into deep depths. The ground is 
hard, grainy soil interspersed with dark rocks and bound together 
by the massive tree roots that extend outwards from the gigantic

branches reach about nearly half of the small island, casting a 
dappled shade across the ground during the hours of the day, 
while the massive trunk reaches high into the sky.

Narrow Inlet of Swamp~
   Travel to the north requires one to move
through the waist deep waters of the swamp, the cool liquid still
save for a meagre current. Plants and trees grow in abundance in
the waters, from the network of lilies and weeds across the
surface to the massive cypress trees, their roots submerged but
their dark trunks and branches towering high overhead. The
'knees' of the cypress trees are spread throughout the area, the
knobbly protrusions a hazard to those careless in their movement
through the swamp.

North And South Through The Swamp On The Trail~
   Massive trees lazily droop their branches over this passage 
through the swamp, the cypress and willow trees the most 
predominant in slowly movement on the trail as it leads to the 
north and south. Little is visible save the ancient trees and 
the diversity of flora clustered over the surface of the swamp, 
the dense plantlife all that is available to see. Travel off the

Muddy Waters Of The Swamp~
   A languid current runs through the dark waters of the swamp, 
the surface roughly where the waist of a man's would be. Leafy 
litter rests gently upon the top of the waters, while underneath 
movement can be felt through the swamp at odd intervals. The 
bottom of the wetlands is soft mud that clings to anything it 
touches, as well as the thick roots of the large trees that grow 
from the dark water. In all directions the swamp continues, yet 
to the north and east a narrow path rises from the surface of the

Tredging Through The Weed-Topped Waters~
   Dark brown water, rather cool in temprature, rises up 
waist-heigh in this section of the swamps. Upon the surface a 
blanket of weeds, lillies, reeds and other small plants stretch 
across the boundries of the swamp, set in varying shades of green 
and brown. Luminous fungi and grey moss cluster at the bases of 
the giant cypress and willows trees that lurch out of the waters, 
reaching high into the sky only to have their branches trail down 
again. To the north, east and west and direction, the swamp 
continues, while a path lies to the south.

Deep Waters Leading Into The Anduin~
   The brown, cool waters of the swamp are deep, with no firm 
ground for even the tallest of beings to stand upon and keep 
their head above the surface. Below the lilly and reed covered 
waters, gnarled roots twist and twine, snaking along the slippery 
mud bottom of the swamp. In all directions one can wade through 
the mostly still waters to higher ground in the wetlands, 
progressing under the canopy of interwoven tree branches. 
   To the west, the river Anduin flows, its currents fast enough 
to sweep a man towards uncertain perils.

ground for even the tallest of beings to stand upon and keep

waters, gnarled roots twist and twine, snaking along the slippery

progressing under the canopy of interwoven tree branches.

trees sprout from the dark brown waters, their trunks encased in 
moss and fungi. Numerous willow trees emerge from the surface of 
the swamp, their slender, drooping branches reaching back down to 
the chill waters, each bearing a wizened beauty about it. 
Countless other species of flora grow with abandon above and 
below the water, with fish and insects eagerly feeding off some. 
To the north and west, a slender trail lies, providing dry

floral debris - even an occasional tree, covered in a blanket of 
moss, lays strewn across the trail. Hanging in the air, 
permeating everything that lingers in the swamp, is the faint, 
acrid odor of rotting wood and damp fungi. The source of this 
light, bitter fragrance is evident in the abundant trees, plants, 
shrubs and weeds that sprout up in all directions.

litter rests gently upon the top of the waters, while underneath 
movement can be felt through the swamp at odd intervals. The 
bottom of the wetlands is soft mud that clings to anything it 
touches, as well as the thick roots of the large trees that grow 
from the dark water. In all directions the swamp continues, yet 
to the north and east a narrow path rises from the surface of the 
waters.

Waist Deep In Muddy Waters East Of The Anduin~
   Dark brown water, rather cool in temprature, rises uprdesc
waist-heigh in this section of the swamps. Upon the surface a 
blanket of weeds, lillies, reeds and other small plants stretch 
across the boundries of the swamp, set in varying shades of green 
and brown. Luminous fungi and grey moss cluster at the bases of 
the giant cypress and willows trees that lurch out of the waters, 
reaching high into the sky only to have their branches trail down 
again. To the north, east and souths the swamp continues.
   To the west, the river Anduin flows, its currents fast enough 
to sweep a man towards uncertain perils.

Trail Leading West Into The Swamp, East To the Marsh~
   This slender trail leads to the east and west, marking a path 
through the large, moss-encrusted trees and expansive bushes. 
The trail quickly slips under the dark brown waters of the swamp 
that clusters either side of the trail, a web of weeds and 
plantlife roaming across its surface. The occasional rock juts 
from the path, breaking free from the strangle of vines that 
grips the dirt, forcing one to tread warily as they progress 
through the swamp. 
   To the east, the towering trees and sprouting flora thins, the 
terrain swiftly turning bleak, dank and dismal.

East And West On The Swamp Path~
   Massive trees lazily droop their branches over this passage 
through the swamp, the cypress and willow trees the most 
predominant in slowly movement on the trail as it leads to the 
east and west. Little is visible save the ancient trees and the 
diversity of flora clustered over the surface of the swamp, the 
dense plantlife all that is available to see. Travel off the 
path leads into brown, murky waters, in which a sluggish current 
slowly carries fallen leaves and twigs away.

Trail Branching North, East and West~
   Spanning from the north to the east and west, this path 
through the swamp is littered with twigs, leaves, stones and all 
manner of floral debris - even an occasional tree, covered in a 
blanket of moss, lays strewn across the trail. Hanging in the 
air, permeating everything that lingers in the swamp, is the 
faint, acrid odor of rotting wood and damp fungi. The source of 
this light, bitter fragrance is evident in the abundant trees, 
plants, shrubs and weeds that sprout up in all directions.

Tredging Through Trees In The Swamp~
   Travel to the north and west requires one to move through the 
waist deep waters of the swamp, the cool liquid still save for a 
meagre current. Plants and trees grow in abundance in the 
waters, from the network of lilies and weeds across the surface 
to the massive cypress trees, their roots submerged but their 
dark trunks and branches towering high overhead. The 'knees' of 
the cypress trees are spread throughout the area, the knobbly 
protrusions a hazard to those careless in their movement through 
the swamp.

Deep Waters In The Middle Of The Swamp~
   The brown, cool waters of the swamp are deep, with no firm 
ground for even the tallest of beings to stand upon and keep 
their head above the surface. Below the illy and reed covered 
waters, gnarled roots twist and twine, snaking along the slippery 
mud bottom of the swamp. In all directions one can wade through 
the mostly still waters to higher ground in the wetlands, 
progressing under the canopy of interwoven tree branches.

edge of the trail, the ground descending sharply past the brim of 
the weed-wreathe surface of the swamp. The occasional coarse

followed by a sighting of brown and black wings through the maze 
of trees. Insects of all description roam freely, buzzing in the 
air and floating across the waters of the swamp.

Forested Isle~
   Sodden, moss-choked earth pulls itself grudgingly out of the 
fetid water to form this small island.  Gnarled cypress trees cling
to the exposed ground, larger and stronger than those spread
around them in the swamp.  The slick, uneven ground is tangled
in vines and roots, making for hazardous footing.  A clump of
large trees dominates the center of the island, their thick and
twisted roots making a gnarled cage crouching in the soggy 
earth.

Deep Waters East Of The Isle~
   The brown, cool waters of the swamp are deep, with no firm 
ground for even the tallest of beings to stand upon and keep 
their head above the surface. Below the illy and reed covered 
waters, gnarled roots twist and twine, snaking along the slippery 
mud bottom of the swamp. In all directions one can wade through 
the mostly still waters to higher ground in the wetlands, 
progressing under the canopy of interwoven tree branches. To the 
east, an isle rises at a steep angle from the dark waters.

Small Inlet Of Brown Water~
   As far as the eye can see in this dank, humid swamp, giant 
trees sprout from the dark brown waters, their trunks encased in 
moss and fungi. Numerous willow trees emerge from the surface of 
the swamp, their slender, drooping branches reaching back down to 
the chill waters, each bearing a wizened beauty about it. 
Countless other species of flora grow with abandon above and 
below the water, with fish and insects eagerly feeding off some. 
To the north, south and west, a slender trail lies, providing dry 
passage through the swamp.

Intersection of Paths Leading North, South And West Through The Swamp~
   This slender trail leads to the north, south and west, marking 
a path through the large, moss-encrusted trees and expansive 
bushes. Several of the trees grow to distinctive heights, their 
branches intertwining to form a thick canopy overhead. The trail 
quickly slips under the dark brown waters of the swamp that 
clusters either side of the trail, a web of weeds and plant life 
roaming across its surface. The occasional rock juts from the 
path, breaking free from the strangle of vines that grips the 
dirt, forcing one to tread warily as they progress through the 
swamp.

Flora-Littered Path Spanning From East To West~
   Spanning from the east to the west, this path through the 
swamp is littered with twigs, leaves, stones and all manner of 
floral debris - even an occasional tree, covered in a blanket of 
moss, lays strewn across the trail. Hanging in the air, 
permeating everything that lingers in the swamp, is the faint, 
acrid odor of rotting wood and damp fungi. The source of this 
light, bitter fragrance is evident in the abundant trees, plants, 
shrubs and weeds that sprout up in all directions.

   Massive trees lazily droop their branches over this passage 
through the swamp, the cypress and willow trees the most 
predominant in slowly movement on the trail as it leads to the 
east, travel to the north, south and west leading beneath the 
waters. Little is visible save the ancient trees and the 
diversity of flora clustered over the surface of the swamp, the 
dense plantlife all that is available to see. Travel off the 
path leads into brown, murky waters, in which a sluggish current 
slowly carries fallen leaves and twigs away.

Bumpy Pool Of Water Amidst The Cypress Trees~
   A languid current runs through the dark waters of the swamp, 
the surface roughly where the waist of a man's would be. Leafy 
litter rests gently upon the top of the waters, while underneath 
movement can be felt through the swamp at odd intervals. The 
bottom of the wetlands is soft mud that clings to anything it 
touches, as well as the thick roots of the large trees that grow 
from the dark water. In all directions, the ground of the swamp 
rises up to a narrow trail, the thick trees thinning out to let 
the path pass by them.

Amidst The Cypress Trees As The Anduin River Drifts In From The West~
   Travel to the north and south requires one to move through the 
waist deep waters of the swamp, the cool liquid still save for a 
meagre current. Plants and trees grow in abundance in the 
waters, from the network of lilies and weeds across the surface 
to the massive cypress trees, their roots submerged but their 
dark trunks and branches towering high overhead. The 'knees' of 
the cypress trees are spread throughout the area, the knobbly 
protrusions a hazard to those careless in their movement through 
the swamp. 
   To the west, the river Anduin flows, its currents fast enough 
to sweep a man towards uncertain perils.

waist deep waters of the swamp, the cool liquid still save for a 
meagre current. Plants and trees grow in abundance in the 
waters, from the network of lilies and weeds across the surface 
to the massive cypress trees, their roots submerged but their 
dark trunks and branches towering high overhead. The 'knees' of 
the cypress trees are spread throughout the area, the knobbly 
protrusions a hazard to those careless in their movement through 
the swamp.

Waist Deep Waters Blanketed By Weeds~
   As far as the eye can see in this dank, humid swamp, giant 
trees sprout from the dark brown waters, their trunks encased in 
moss and fungi. Numerous willow trees emerge from the surface of 
the swamp, their slender, drooping branches reaching back down to 
the chill waters, each bearing a wizened beauty about it. 
Countless other species of flora grow with abandon above and 
below the water, with fish and insects eagerly feeding off some. 
To the west, a slender trail lies, providing dry passage through 
the swamp.

On The Trail, Shifting From The North To The West~
   Massive trees lazily droop their branches over this passage 
through the swamp, the cypress and willow trees the most 
predominant in slowly movement on the trail as it leads to the 
north and west. Little is visible save the ancient trees and the 
diversity of flora clustered over the surface of the swamp, the 
dense plantlife all that is available to see. Travel off the 
path leads into brown, murky waters, in which a sluggish current 
slowly carries fallen leaves and twigs away.

Three Branching Paths Leading East, South And West~
   Spanning from the east, to the south and to the west, this 
path through the swamp is littered with twigs, leaves, stones and 
all manner of floral debris - even an occasional tree, covered in 
a blanket of moss, lays strewn across the trail. Hanging in the 
air, permeating everything that lingers in the swamp, is the 
faint, acrid odor of rotting wood and damp fungi. The source of 
this light, bitter fragrance is evident in the abundant trees, 
plants, shrubs and weeds that sprout up in all directions.

Swamp Trail Leading North And East Past A Ruined Barge~
   This slender trail leads to the north and east, marking a path 
through the large, moss-encrusted trees and expansive bushes. 
The trail quickly slips under the dark brown waters of the swamp 
that clusters either side of the trail, a web of weeds and 
plantlife roaming across its surface. The occasional rock juts 
from the path, breaking free from the strangle of vines that 
grips the dirt, forcing one to tread warily as they progress 
through the swamp. 
   On the corner of the bending trail here is a large, upturned 
barge, the wood rotted and a massive breach in the keel.

Swamp Waters Leading Into The Anduin~
   A languid current runs through the dark waters of the swamp, 
the surface roughly where the waist of a man's would be. Leafy 
litter rests gently upon the top of the waters, while underneath 
movement can be felt through the swamp at odd intervals. The 
bottom of the wetlands is soft mud that clings to anything it 
touches, as well as the thick roots of the large trees that grow 
from the dark water. In all directions the swamp continues, yet 
to the west the waters quickly slip into the great river of the 
Anduin as it continues its flow from north to south.

   Dark brown water, rather cool in temprature, rises up 
waist-heigh in this section of the swamps. Upon the surface a 
blanket of weeds, lillies, reeds and other small plants stretch 
across the boundries of the swamp, set in varying shades of green 
and brown. Luminous fungi and grey moss cluster at the bases of 
the giant cypress and willows trees that lurch out of the waters, 
reaching high into the sky only to have their branches trail down 
again. To the east, south and west, the swamp continues, while a

ground for even the tallest of beings to stand upon and keep

West Of A Trail, In The Waters Of The Swamp~
   A languid current runs through the dark waters of the swamp, 
the surface roughly where the waist of a man's would be. Leafy 
litter rests gently upon the top of the waters, while underneath 
movement can be felt through the swamp at odd intervals. The 
bottom of the wetlands is soft mud that clings to anything it 
touches, as well as the thick roots of the large trees that grow 
from the dark water. In all directions the swamp continues, yet 
to the east a narrow path rises from the surface of the waters, 
and to the south the waters stop all together as they meet the 
heathlands of the Ithilien.

Southern Edge Of The Nindalf~
   Dark brown water, rather cool in temprature, rises up 
waist-heigh in this section of the swamps. Upon the surface a 
blanket of weeds, lillies, reeds and other small plants stretch 
across the boundries of the swamp, set in varying shades of green 
and brown. Luminous fungi and grey moss cluster at the bases of 
the giant cypress and willows trees that lurch out of the waters, 
reaching high into the sky only to have their branches trail down 
again. To the north, east and south, the swamp continues, while 
a large mass of land, the Northern Ithilien. rises up to the 
south.

Corner Of The Swamp~
   Travel to the north and east requires one to move through the 
waist deep waters of the swamp, the cool liquid still save for a 
meagre current. Plants and trees grow in abundance in the 
waters, from the network of lilies and weeds across the surface 
to the massive cypress trees, their roots submerged but their 
dark trunks and branches towering high overhead. The 'knees' of 
the cypress trees are spread throughout the area, the knobbly 
protrusions a hazard to those careless in their movement through 
the swamp.

Nestled Amongst the Branches~
   The thick branches of this large cypress tree have grown in 
such a way to create a small nook at the end of the trunk, large 
enough for a number of people to cluster within. The leafy 
branches of the cypress conceal the position from those below, 
and also offer an excellent view of the surrounding swamp. In 
all directions, the expanse of trees and water continues, while 
further to the north a large mountain is visible. A monstrous 
rivers runs from the north-west to the south, and beyond this the 
landscape disappear over the horizon.

Inside The Keel Of An Upturned Barge~
   Thrown here perhaps by some great storm many years ago, 
ankle-high water of a dark, murky nature fills this remnants of a 
barge. A gaping hole in the north side of the vessel opens out 
onto the rampant swamp of the Nindalf, while the southern and 
western walls have been long ago dashed against the trunk of a 
great cypress tree. Thick roots curl about the ground on that 
side of the ruin, insects drifting slowly through the air and 
water. What remains of the stout, wooden walls is covered in 
moss and strangled by vines, so much so that this area appears to 
be the interior of some great tree. To the west the water 
deepens, the length of the barge presumably extending down into 
the waters of the swamp.

Amongst The Branches Of The Willow Tree~
   The sheer scope of this gigantic tree allows one to nestle up 
amongst the branches with ease, room for many people to sit up 
amongst the somewhat precarious area. A view of the slow swamp 
is clearly visible from this vantage point, of the majestic 
mountains to the north and the swiftly flowing Anduin to the 
south, the faint smoke of civilisation drifting over the southern 
horizon. Many bird nests litter the dead branches of the willow 
tree, but otherwise there is little sign of life up here.

A Stretch of Heath Land, Northeast of a Mighty River~
   The steamy bog to north and east meets here, the earth 
regaining some of its solidity as it stretches toward the 
Anduin's shore. The land slopes downward to meet the water's 
surface, the scraggly roots of riverside plants and saplings 
holding it firm. The Anduin is not as clear here, as it is 
shrouded with silt and debris from the Nindalf to the north. The 
river's breadth is noticeably large, granted new strength from 
the hidden marshland tributaries.

A Stretch Of Heath, Leading North Into The Nindalf~
   A vast expanse of wet heathland stretches here, snaking in all
directions. The horizon is clearly visible here, the massive
mountains of the Emyn Muil and dark stretches of swamp and marsh
set before them. The earth is soft and wet, overrun with
low-lying scrubs and wet vegetation. Dead trees are littered
sparsely across the area, their blackened husks granting new life
to the bog. A web of algae stretches over the network of glassy
pools here, disappearing into a forest of reeds.
   To the north, the heathland quickly slips under the cool
waters of the forested Nindalf swamp.

Amongst Boggy Woodlands At A Trail Leading North Into The Nindalf~
   Tufts of hard, brown grass and small, grey plants shoot out of 
the soft ground of the north Ithilien, the roaming heath 
seemingly abandoned by all things living. The occasional great 
tree lays strangled by lichen, bowed down under the weight of 
years, and on the occasionally hillock of hard land heaps of 
rotted wood and stone can be seen. In all directions the bog 
continues, distant mountains visible to the north and east, their 
peaks capped with snow. 
   A trail winds its way through the boggy woodlands, leading
deeper into the swamp known as the Nindalf.

A Silent Bogland South Of A Swamp~
   The ground underfoot here varies greatly as it stretches 
across untold miles of the far northern Ithilien. From broken 
puddles of muddy water to soggy soil, all punctured by the 
occasional outcropping of dark rock, there is little in the way 
to support easy travel across the heathland, yet alone 
habitation. A steady silence hangs in the air, the uninhabited 
bog set far from civilization, though the occasional rustling of 
grass betrays the presence of some life. 
   This area of the bogland is set to the south of the Nindalf, 
the dark waters of the massive swamp directly north.

Between Hills In The Heath, South Of Swamp-Waters~
   The contours of the far Northern Ithilien roll up and down in 
gentle curves, the small hills and gulleys created all of soft, 
boggy land typical to the roaming heathland. Numerous small 
bushes and dark grasses grow in a rampant, haphazard fashion 
across the countryside, the large flora of trees strewn either 
dead across puddles of muddy water or bent at strange angles. 
Broadly sloping down from the horizon-set eastern mountains, a 
dark stain of land crowds the north border of the bog. 
   The hills eventually smooth down, leading quickly beneath
the waters of the swamp as the land progresses north.

The rocky out croppings covered by lichen. A dismal bog lies to

dark stain of land crowds the north border of the bog. 
   To the north, the land quickly plunges to sink below the foul 
waters of the massive marsh that spans across the horizon.

Forested Hills Extending in all Directions~
   Fine textured and slightly cascading branches hang from the 
giant trees here in broad pyramids. The needles, small and 
bright green stand in stark contrast to the darkened wrinkled 
bark from which they grow. Tiny birds dart about in a frenzy of 
motion, flitting from branch to branch disregarding the season in 
their search for food. Winding between the larger growth in this 
area are broad leaved evergreen bushes.

Forested Hills Close to Eastern Mountains~
   The shrubby presence of secondary growth takes advantage of 
the shelter provided by the larger trees and grows in profusion 
beneath their boughs. The primary growth here supports bright 
green and bluish green leaves turn stunning shades of red and 
orange in autumn standing in contrast to their silvery bark. The 
trees grow in sizes ranging from the size of clustering shrubs to 
modest sized trees. A heavy miasma of broken down vegetation 
permeates the area and clogs the sinuses. To the east a wall of 
unbroken cliff faced mountains stretch toward the sky and deny 
further movement in that direction.

to the east while decreasing to the west. The landscape is 
filled with trees of varying types, shapes and sizes. Low, brown

that of a man's shin to higher than the knee. From above leaves 
occasionally fall, littering the ground with decaying vegetation 
as the seasons pass.

is littered with decaying leaves and bark providing ample food for
the trees. A few dead trees lie throughout the area, their

Copse Of Dead Trees~

the soft ground of the north Ithilien, the roaming heath 
seemingly abandoned by all things living. The occasional great 
tree lays strangled by lichen, bowed down under the weight of 
years, and on the occasionally hillock of hard land heaps of 
rotted wood and stone can be seen. In all directions the bog 
continues, distant mountains visible to the north and east, their 
peaks capped with snow. 
   A number of dead trees with skeletal branches are clustered 
about a slab of rock that extends out from the east. A dark hole 
barely visible amoungst the tree limbs.

Heathland About A Rocky Outcropping~
   The ground underfoot here varies greatly as it stretches
across untold miles of the far northern Ithilien. From broken
puddles of muddy water to soggy soil, all punctured by the
occasional outcropping of dark rock, there is little in the way
to support easy travel across the heathland, yet alone
habitation. A steady silence hangs in the air, the uninhabited
bog set far from civilization, though the occasional rustling of
grass betrays the presence of some life.
   In the middle of the sodden pasture here is a rugged rocky
outcropping, rising up from the loose scree and scrubs.

Damp Field Interspersed With Broken Tombstones~
   Set amongst the boggy, none-too-solid land of the Far North
Ithilien here are numerous tombstones, most bent at steep angles,
collapses, or otherwise having only the tip visible. None bear
any words or script upon them, yet all have a faint design,
possibly that of a tree or a many-headed snake, chiseled into the
stone but worn away by the passing of time. A few hardwood
trees, including an emaciated willow, grow up from the soggy
ground, many having their roots ensnared about the tombstones.
The graveyard continues to the east into a walled compound, piles
of rubble to the north, south and west framing this segment.

Defaced, Archaic Graveyard Set Between Solid Stone Walls~
   Solid stone walls lie to the north, east and south here, 
archaic patterns and shapes carved upon the interior of them. 
Most of the designs have been erased or broken off, the stone 
fence now pitted and scarred, in some places splashed with crude 
shapes of axes, skulls and claws. The numerous tombstones 
clustered within the compound here are similarly defaced; those 
that do not bear roughly painted features across them are broken 
in half. Numerous holes have been dug in the ground, skeletal 
remains and scraps of hair and cloth poking out. To the west, 
the walls slowly degenerate into piles of rubble, the graveyard 
opening out onto the heathland at large. 
   
   A single moss covered stone crypt stands intact, off to the 
far eastern edge of the graveyard. A large flat rock covering 
its entrance has been shattered and hangs open.

set before them. The earth is soft and wet, overrun with

which support needle-like leaves. Whether winter's cold or

Quiet Woodlands~
   The sky can be seen filtering through the branches of the 
trees in this woodland area. The trees are tall and though some 
seem to be dying others are full of life. Animals can be heard 
scurrying through the undergrowth occasionally and the wind 
rustles the leave of the trees. Small shrubs grow everywhere and 
occasionally a rock pokes through the undergrowth.

The Edge of a Dense Forest~
   Only a few faint patches of sky can be seen through the 
overhanging branches and leaves above. The thick tree trunks are 
covered in soft green moss, and stand close together. Small 
rocks nestle between gnarled roots, and the occasional rustle of 
foliage indicates movement in the surrounding bushes.

Amid a Moist Bog~
   A vast expanse of wet heathland stretches here, snaking in all
directions. The horizon is clearly visible here, the massive
mountains of the Emyn Muil and dark stretches of swamp and marsh
set before them. The earth is soft and wet, overrun with
low-lying scrubs and wet vegetation. Dead trees are littered
sparsely across the area, their blackened husks granting new life
to the bog. A web of algae stretches over the network of glassy
pools here, disappearing into a forest of reeds.

Damp Boglands~
   Tufts of hard, brown grass and small, grey plants shoot out of
the soft ground of the north Ithilien, the roaming heath
seemingly abandoned by all things living. The occasional great
tree lays strangled by lichen, bowed down under the weight of
years, and on the occasionally hillock of hard land heaps of
rotted wood and stone can be seen. In all directions the bog
continues, distant mountains visible to the north and east, their
peaks capped with snow.

A Watery, Broken Countryside~
   The ground underfoot here varies greatly as it stretches 
across untold miles of the far northern Ithilien. From broken 
puddles of muddy water to soggy soil, all punctured by the 
occasional outcropping of dark rock, there is little in the way 
to support easy travel across the heathland, yet alone 
habitation. A steady silence hangs in the air, the uninhabited 
bog set far from civilization, though the occasional rustling of 
grass betrays the presence of some life. 
   To the north, a stone wall wrapped in vines and weighed down 
by fungii stands.

Damp Boglands~
   The contours of the far Northern Ithilien roll up and down in
gentle curves, the small hills and gulleys created all of soft,
boggy land typical to the roaming heathland. Numerous small
bushes and dark grasses grow in a rampant, haphazard fashion
across the countryside, the large flora of trees strewn either
dead across puddles of muddy water or bent at strange angles.
Broadly sloping down from the horizon-set eastern mountains, a
dark stain of land crowds the north border of the bog.

Thickening Forest~
   Rich brown earth reveals itself in bare patches and hints at 
the life and potential for growth in the woodland. Winding 
between the larger growth in this area are broad leaved evergreen 
bushes. Growing intermittently the trees here do not gain 
towering heights, instead their branching trunks reach out from 
near the ground to their heights with tiny feathery leaves.

Forested Hills at the Base of a Mountain Range~
   The open airy branches of the trees in this area start close 
to the ground and extend outward from their tall white trunks to 
many times the height of a man. The waxy, uniformly shaped 
leaves and blooms of the under plants grow in tiny clusters 
beneath the comparatively giant trees here and defy the colder 
months with their dark glossy greenery. Rich brown earth reveals 
itself in bare patches and hints at the life and potential for

in that direction.

A Narrow Trail in a Thick Wood~
   A narrow trail threads it way through the trees, running north 
and south through a thick woodland. The tall trees spread out in 
all directions, supported by firm and rich soil. The forest floor
is littered with decaying leaves and bark providing ample food for
the trees. A few dead trees lie throughout the area, their 
blackened husks granting new life to the floor of the forest.

Remnants Of A Trail Leading Through The Bog~
   The contours of the far Northern Ithilien roll up and down in 
gentle curves, the small hills and gulleys created all of soft, 
boggy land typical to the roaming heathland. Numerous small 
bushes and dark grasses grow in a rampant, haphazard fashion 
across the countryside, the large flora of trees strewn either 
dead across puddles of muddy water or bent at strange angles. 
Broadly sloping down from the horizon-set eastern mountains, a 
dark stain of land crowds the north border of the bog. 
   Leading from the south before gently turning to a number of 
dilapidated structures to the west is the hint of what was once
a trail, the grass not so tall and an ingrained set of wagon 
tracks all that signs that remain now.

   A thick carpet of moss grows here across the forest floor, 
muting all sound and lending a hushed quiet to the area. Oval 
leaves, slender beams, white bark and far reaching surface roots 
render an ephemeral majesty to this area year round. Shed bark, 
broken branches and season after season's lifeless leaves 
decorate the ground, coating the forest floor with a quiet 
carpet. To the east a wall of unbroken cliff faced mountains 
stretch toward the sky and deny further movement in that

Vast Forest of Ithilien~
   The sky can be seen filtering through the branches of the 
trees in this woodland area. The trees are tall and though some 
seem to be dying others are full of life. Animals can be heard 
scurrying through the undergrowth occasionally and the wind 
rustles the leave of the trees. Small shrubs grow everywhere and 
occasionally a rock pokes through the undergrowth.

Sprawling Woodlands With Eastern Mountains in Sight~
   A thick woodland spreads in all directions, here. The earth is 
firm and rich, well fed by the decaying leaves and bark on the 
great number of trees that grow in the area. Dead trees appear 
sparsely throughout the area, their blackened husks granting new 
life to the floor of the forest.

Small Stream~
   The cool, refreshing waters of this river flow at a steady 
pace from mountains visible at the eastern horizon to the west, 
bringing with it a collection of twigs and other small foliage. 
To the east and the west of the stream, the damp lands of the 
heathland can be seen, many small rivulets branching off and into 
the uneven terrain. To the north, the river comes to a shallow 
end.

An Earthy Shore~
   This river bank is overrun with small bushes, scraggly weeds,
spouting rushes and copious river weeds, the vegetation extending
a slight distant out into the waters that flow at a swift pace to
the south. A gentle slope of muddy ground leads down to the
surface of the river, the slippery descent a possible hazard to
unwary individuals. Northwards, the untamed lands continue.

North of a Crude, Fortified Bridge in the Soggy Ithilien~
   Tall grass, wiry bushes, and dead trees populate the lands of 
Ithilien here, the only sign of human habitation a number of 
ruined buildings set a good distance to the north-west. Cutting 
through the low scree is a dirt path, what few cobblestones 
remain spread few and far between. The little upkeep given to 
the trail is obvious, for grass grows freely across it, with only 
a deep wagon-rut remaining untouched by the spread of the 
heathland. From the east, a small yet swift stream runs, a 
bridge spanning across it to the south. 
   Though several burnt pieces of timber remain on the shore 
nearby, the bridge has been shored up with heavy logs for 
support, and thick, sturdy planks set across it. More recently, 
judging by the lack of wear and the cruder yet still functional 
construction, it has been expanded into a bridgehead, a series of 
poles and planks protecting those within from both arrow-fire and 
the weather.

Silent Bogland About The Cairn~
   The ground underfoot here varies greatly as it stretches 
across this section Northern Ithilien. From broken puddles of 
muddy water to soggy soil, all punctured by the occasional 
outcropping of dark rock, there is little in the way to support 
easy travel across the heathland, yet alone habitation. A steady 
silence hangs in the air, the uninhabited bog set far from 
civilization, though the occasional rustling of grass betrays the 
presence of some life.

Hilly Woodland East of a Cairn~
   The terrain here becomes hilly, generally increasing in slope 
to the east while decreasing to the west. The landscape is 
filled with trees of varying types, shapes and sizes. Low, brown 
and green bushes make up the undergrowth, ranging in height from 
that of a man's shin to higher than the knee. From above leaves 
occasionally fall, littering the ground with decaying vegetation 
as the seasons pass.

Swift Flowing Tributary~
   Fresh, chill waters flow from the east to the south in this
river, the current strong enough to pull those overly encumbered
beneath the blue surface and down into the dark, claustrophobic
underwaters. As one moves to the northern side of the wide, yet
crossable river, various reeds and rushes begin to populate the
water, the flora concentrated on the north bank.

Swift Flowing Tributary~
   The stream of this tributary flows at neither a fast nor a
slow pace, the current neither hurtling a man downstream to his
death, but neither allowing one to simply laze in the water
without being dragged beneath the surface of the water. A good
distance in size, there is a stark contrast to the lush southern
bank and the somewhat bleak northern.

On the southern side, the river flows past many trees, branches
drooping lazily in the water, whilst to the north more foul

Swift Flowing Tributary~
   As the strong current takes the water of this river from the
east towards the west, the terrain of the northern Ithilien is
passed. Deeper than two men standing atop of one another, the
dark depths of the water often show a glimpse of silver, a sign
of the fishy inhabitants of this river. To the broad directions
of north and south, the two opposing river banks lie.

Swift Flowing Tributary~
   The cool, refreshing waters of this river flow at a steady
pace from mountains visible at the eastern horizon to the west,
bringing with it a collection of twigs and other small foliage.
On the southern side, the river flows past many trees, branches
drooping lazily in the water, whilst to the north more foul
terrain is passed.

   This dark river bottom is the site of a strong current
dragging from east to west. Many rocks and gnarled tree roots
can be spotted amongst the floor of the riverbed, along with a
collection of fish and amphibian creatures, moving about their
daily lives. The banks, set a fair distance to the north and
south, are of slippery mud, and difficult to climb.

Beneath The Waters Of A Swift Flowing Tributary~
   This dark river bottom is the site of a strong current
dragging from east to west. Many rocks and gnarled tree roots
can be spotted amongst the floor of the riverbed, along with a
collection of fish and amphibian creatures, moving about their
daily lives. The banks, set a fair distance to the north and
south, are of slippery mud, and difficult to climb.

A Grassy Length of Shore, North of a Ford~
   Water from the tributary to the south laps against the mud on 
the shore hear, the stream flowing down from the Ephel Duath 
mountain range to the east. The ground on this side of the river 
is rough and unkempt, long grass rising up to knee or waist 
height, the occasional great tree strewn across the landscape, 
and dead branches filtering the swift stream as it flows 
westward. In spite of its speed, the stream is shallower here, 
rocks and pieces of wood strewn across the bottom. Once could, 
without too much trouble, possibly make it across on foot, but 
the bank here is significantly higher than the river, making 
getting out a trouble should anyone choose to interfere.

   A wide tributary to the Great Anduin River runs to the south 
here, the bank of ground soft and unstable. The water flows from 
east to west, carrying along with it twigs and branches along 
with river life of fish and small mammals. To the north, the 
heathland extends outwards to the edge of the horizon, the 
landscape composed of boggy plains and copses of scrubby tree.

Shore North of a Muddied Tributary~
   This river bank is overrun with small bushes, scraggly weeds,
spouting rushes and copious river weeds, the vegetation extending
a slight distant out into the waters that flow at a swift pace to
the south. A gentle slope of muddy ground leads down to the
surface of the river, the slippery descent a possible hazard to
unwary individuals. Northwards, the untamed lands continue.

Swift Flowing Tributary~
   As the strong current takes the water of this river from the
east towards the west, the terrain of the northern Ithilien is
passed. Deeper than two men standing atop of one another, the
dark depths of the water often show a glimpse of silver, a sign
of the fishy inhabitants of this river. To the broad directions
of north and south, the two opposing river banks lie.

Swift Flowing Tributary~
   The stream of this tributary flows at neither a fast nor a
slow pace, the current neither hurtling a man downstream to his
death, but neither allowing one to simply laze in the water
without being dragged beneath the surface of the water. A good
distance in size, there is a stark contrast to the lush southern
bank and the somewhat bleak northern.

Partially Collapsed Worn Wooden Bridge~
   This wooden bridge crosses a small stream, yet certainly with 
a fast enough current. Many of the planks are weak, and a few 
gaps have appeared in the bridge, allowing one a view of the 
waters as they rush past underneath. Extending northward from 
the bridge if a beaten trail of dirt holding the occasional 
outcropping rock. To the south, a rugged, forested hill lies, 
and a somewhat damaged stone fort is visible to the south-west. 
   
   The north end of the bridge stands precariously atop the 
rushing river, broken planks making passage nearly impossible.

Entrace To The Humid Cavern~
   Warm, humid air slides out from the western mouth of the cave, 
almost like the breathing of some great creature. This rocky 
surface tumbles down from the east, a lip of craggy stones 
allowing one to climb back up to the despondent heathland without 
too much effort. The ceiling of the cavern is formed by a large 
rock jutting over the entrance, lichen and moss stretched across 
it. The uneven surface leading inside the dark recesses is 
littered with numerous small bones, a closer examination of such 
revealing teeth marks along them.

Muggy Midden-Lined Cave~
   Algae ridden water pools in the uneven corners of this cave, 
seeping through the hairline cracks that run about the walls. 
Strewn across the hard rock ground, often dampened by the 
puddles, are piles of midden and furs of all sorts; remnants of 
leather and wool clothing, collections and shards of yellowing 
bones, and scraps of metal and wood all litter the area. A 
number of the piles have been assembled into crude pallets. The 
air here holds a muggy, humid feel to it, and the cave extends to 
the north, east and south.

Between The Rock Walls Of The Cavern~
   Cobwebs rule the stone ceiling of this underground cavern, 
numerous eight-legged insects visible climbing slowly across the 
thick surface of webbing. Many other insects scurry amongst the 
filth and debris scattered at the floor of the cave, their growth 
continuing unchecked. The dank cavern continues in two 
directions, the somewhat low roof rising up as the tunnel slops 
downard to the south, while to the west the ceiling and floor 
rapidly close, though a small hole remains in that direction.

Bone-Littered Subterranean Chamber~
   Bones of all shapes, sizes and descriptions clutter the cavern 
floor here, some clearly identifiable such as a grouping of bears 
skulls piled up on one side of the cave, whilst others of a more 
enigmatic nature. One theme ties the bones together; they have 
all been stripped down to a dusky yellow surface. Rather small 
in size, the cave expands as its uneven rock floor leads to the 
north, the hot, stuffy air here becoming somewhat fresher as 
well.

Cramped Cave With A Hole-Marked Ceiling~
   A number of moderate sized holes are been worn away in the 
roof of this small cavern alcove, set over them the undersides of 
various plants and shrubs. The tough roots of this flora spreads 
out over the ceiling, trailing down the walls and into the 
brackish puddles of water that pool on the ground. A steep path 
along the northern wall allows one to scrabble up and out of the 
cave, a similar sized hole set in the eastern wall allowing the 
determined progress deeper into the cavern.

Interior Of The Sunken, Roofless Cottage~
   Thick beams of rotting wood span across the rounded, lopsided 
stone walls of the cottage, whatever roofing they may have held 
long gone and now offering one an excellent chance to enjoy the 
conditions of the weather, whether bright and sunny or dark and 
stormy. The ground here is little more than mud, extremely 
slippery underfoot, dark splotches of wet and dry earth covering 
the bottom of the stone walls. A low doorway exits out to the 
south, back to the heathland. 
   The many holes in the walls offer many vantage points for 
spying the land outside and even some large enough to squeeze out 
of.

Interior Of The Partially-Demolished Barn~
   This lopsided barn slopes from the higher northern section to 
the lower southern side, dark, weed-ridden waters pooling in the 
bottom section of the structure. The crowning feature of the 
barn is the massive dead tree that has smashed through the roof 
on the lower side some time past, a scattering of broken wooden 
slates floating in the waters there. The walls of the barn bear 
great cracks along them, and at high winds the building shakes 
somewhat. Sickly coloured hay is spread everywhere across the 
barn, save for a small area at the northern doorway, from which a 
small jump leads back down to the fields.

Swift Flowing Tributary~
   Fresh, chill waters flow from the east to the south in this 
river, the current strong enough to pull those overly encumbered 
beneath the blue surface and down into the dark, claustrophobic 
underwaters. As one moves to the northern side of the wide, yet 
crossable river, various reeds and rushes begin to populate the 
water, the flora concentrated on the north bank. 
   From the east and above, water tumbles down from the great 
slopes of the moutains, the terrain swiftly changing from rocky 
and hard to moving past the bogs and woodlands of the Ithilien. 
A series of rocks allows those willing to try to possibly scale 
up the waterfall.

Beneath The Waters Of A Swift Flowing Tributary~
   This dark river bottom is the site of a strong current
dragging from east to west. Many rocks and gnarled tree roots
can be spotted amongst the floor of the riverbed, along with a
collection of fish and amphibian creatures, moving about their
daily lives. The banks, set a fair distance to the north and
south, are of slippery mud, and difficult to climb.

Swift Flowing Tributary~
   The stream of this tributary flows at neither a fast nor a
slow pace, the current neither hurtling a man downstream to his
death, but neither allowing one to simply laze in the water
without being dragged beneath the surface of the water. A good
distance in size, there is a stark contrast to the lush southern
bank and the somewhat bleak northern.

Beneath The Waters Of A Swift Flowing Tributary~
   Fresh, chill waters flow from the east to the south in this
river, the current strong enough to pull those overly encumbered
beneath the blue surface and down into the dark, claustrophobic
underwaters. As one moves to the northern side of the wide, yet
crossable river, various reeds and rushes begin to populate the
water, the flora concentrated on the north bank.

Swift Flowing Tributary~
   The cool, refreshing waters of this river flow at a steady
pace from mountains visible at the eastern horizon to the west,
bringing with it a collection of twigs and other small foliage.
On the southern side, the river flows past many trees, branches
drooping lazily in the water, whilst to the north more foul
terrain is passed.

Howling Waterfall Spilling From The Ephel Duath~
   Water courses over the towering heights of the eastern Ephel 
Duath, spilling down the jagged rocks and steep falls to land 
with a crash in this dark circular pool, worn away by thousands 
of years of wear from the stream. The surge of the water drives 
the tributary westwards, quickly passing back the mountainous 
outer slopes of the range to pass divide the Ithilien. Many 
jagged rocks lay underneath the surface of the water here, and 
those than linger are constantly battered by the barrage of water 
that is flung from the tops of the mountains.

Narrow Rocky Inlet~
   Like a jagged knife gash, a small, narrow inlet cuts into the 
sheer face of the cliffs rising up on the eastern side of the 
river. The water of the tributary flows into it, lapping against 
the sharp rocks, making them very slippery. To all appearances 
the only way back out is west an into the main flow of the river 
as the rocky faces rise up high to the north, south and east.

Slippery Rocky Path Above a River~
   Seemingly chiselled into the side of the sheer face of rock 
above a swift flowing stream that funnels out from the gorge and 
to the west, is a treacherous trail. It climbs up the northern 
cliff, overshadowed by it and the cliff directly opposite to the 
south. The air is dank and wet, as is the path itself, and 
occasionally small stones tumble down into the water below. The 
path ascends from the waters below and up eventually to a point 
almost atop the gorge.

from anyone looking up from below. It is cut into the rock on 
the north of the inlet, narrowed almost to a point at its 
westernmost end, and broadening further east. It should not be

   This is a small gap between two sharp rocks that jut upwards, 
overlooking a rocky, slippery path that winds its way up the 
cliff-side. A very narrow path, lined with various small shrubs, 
connects it to a small landing atop the gorge, but it is fairly

A Foul, Dank Pit~
   Barely wide enough for a man to squeeze through, a narrow 
passage leads down into this foul, dank lair.  It opens up 
dramatically into a wide, if short, cavern.  Strewn with the 
crushed bones of a variety of animals large and small, sheafs of 
dry scaley skin can be found in amongst the refuse.  The whole 
area is permeated with a foul stench, like rotted meat and the 
spore of some animal.
   Water seeps down from the walls making ankle-deep pools on 
the filth strewn floor, the small hole leading out and up provides a 
breeze of fresh air and narrow, rough openings to the east and 
west lead deeper into the cavern.

Underwater Cave~
   Behind the waterfall, a narrow, dark tunnel extends down into 
the depths, completely submerged in water. Slime clings to the 
walls and several sharp rocks stick out into the water. The cave 
is relatively wide at its mouth in the river, and narrows further 
down, at which point it is lost in the darkness.

is very gloomy and quite cold. The tunnel branches into two 
different directions here, one going on further down, the other 
branching off to the east.

though the ceiling is quite high, so there is plenty of breathing 
space. The cave air is very moist and water drips down into the 
lake from stalactites above. Some sort of phosphorescent lichen 
on the walls gives the room a faint degree of luminence.

   Here is a very large, subterranean lake that almost takes up 
the entire surface of an immense, domed cavern. The water is icy 
cold and very dark, and in the middle of the lake is a single, 
lonely isle of rock. Towards the east the water becomes shallow 
enough, and the bank low enough that one can climb out of the 
lake. The embankment leads to another large cavern to the east. 
The air throughout the cavern is very moist and water drips from 
stalactites above into the lake, causing ripples in the otherwise 
still waters, and echoes thoughout the cave.

   This cavern is immense. The ceiling reaches high up into the 
darkness, and some particularly long stalactites can be seen

several thick stalagmites rise from the floor like giant 
spearpoints. Two large tunnels branch off to the north and 
south, but also a hand-hewn staircase ascends up into the 
darkness. To the west is a large, subterranean lake, and the 
floor of the cavern is low enough to reach the water's edge. The 
air is relative dank and quite thick and stifling.

Beneath the Waters of the Forbidden Pool~
   The waterfall that plunges into the pool churns the waters 
violently, and the water disappears through a small tunnel in the 
rock, creating a strong current. The water is very cold, and a 
few fish can been seen in it, amid the very sharp rocks that 
stick up from the bottom. There are also various kinds of reeds 
growing up from the floor of the pool.

   All about the waters within the deep, stone basin of rock, 
churn and gurgle at the base of the waterfall. The pool is 
generally oval-shaped, and filled with knife-like, razor-sharp

that is low enough at which to climb out of the water. The sky

Knee-High Grass About The Farm~
   A narrow trail of packed dirt runs through knee-high grass,
leading north to a large, battered farmhouse, the wooden planks
of varying hues as they've been replaced over the many seasons
the house has seen. Heavy shutters and a thick door face down the
path, bearing the occasional notch and scrape across them. Either
side of the trail rises up high grass, reaching to the knee of a
man, a short cut of dirt leading to the western barn, large gates
painted a drab red colour.

Inside the Large Farmhouse~
   The lowest floor of this farmhouse looks to serve as a 
kitchen, bedroom and living room for its occupants, a dozen 
pallets of burlap sacks stuffed with straw tucked into one 
corner, the centre of the wooden construction occupied by a large 
cauldron that serves as a fireplace and stove. River rushes have 
been laid over the floor, yet the old wooden boards still creak 
beneath the foot. A pair of stout, barred shutters look out over 
the southern trail, a staircase running up along the northern 
wall leading to the next floor of the farmhouse.

Top Floor of the Farmhouse~

resting a few feet above the head of an average man, running from 
north to south. At the southern edge of the farmhouse, a pair of 
thick shutters lie, offering a view outside the building and down 
onto the trail that leads before it. Odds and ends of farmlife 
litter the ground, such as old pieces of leather tack, rusted hoe 
heads and the occasional spotless bone. A staircase on the 
northern side of the house leads down.

   Numerous stalls divide this barnhouse into a number of 
sections, each of the divisions filled with hay and straw. The 
smell of animals and manure hang heavy in the air, the dirt of 
the floor warm. Dust climbs freely up the drab-red-painted walls 
of the barn, and a colony of cobwebs has claimed the sloped 
ceiling. At the eastern end of the barn, a large pair of gates 
lie, unbarred from this side, opening out onto a grassy trail.

   This circular tunnel appears to have been crudely dug, as the

whereas other spots are smaller and cramped. Running north and 
south, the tunnel runs around large chunks of stone, and roots 
stick out from the ceiling in many spots. In the eastern wall of 
the tunnel, a fairly large hole has been dug, a few broad stones 
lying next to it.

A Small Burrow~
   This small cavern's walls are rounded slightly, giving it a 
bowl-like shape. A large root runs from the center of the 
cavern's ceiling to the western wall, and it bears many scratches 
and nicks as it winds down to the floor of the cavern. Strewn 
about the cavern are small bones and bits of fur, some of which 
has been heaped into piles. The strong odor of rot and feces 
hangs in the air.

A Partially Blocked Tunnel~
   A wide, dark boulder partially blocks the tunnel to the east. 
A smaller tunnel leads underneath the stone, dipping down and 
disappearing into darkness. Next to the rock to the north and 
south, smaller tunnels branch off, exposing more of the rock's 
surface, but they only progress a few feet in. Clumps of loose 
earth lie in piles around the base of the rock.

A Wide, Roughly Dug Tunnel~
   The tunnel here widens on all sides as it progresses from 
north to south. Bones, both large and small, lie scattered about 
the sides of the tunnel, several of which have bits of meat and 
cloth stuck to them. Two large rocks jut into the tunnel in one 
section, creating a narrow pass in that area.

A Split in The Tunnel~
   The wide, roughly dug tunnel splits in two directions here. 
While the beginnings of each new tunnel are set close together, 
the tunnels themselves lead in opposite directions. A variety of 
small animal bones and small rocks are strewn across the ground, 
as well as the occasional scrap of metal and cloth.

   The wide, roughly dug tunnel turns sharply here, and inclines 
slightly downward as it progresses to the south. Bones of 
various sizes lie scattered across the dirt floor of the tunnel, 
many of which have been trampled into the dirt floor. A cluster 
of large rocks lie in a section of the tunnel, and the walls have 
been dug around them.

A Large Burrow~
   A wide tunnel to the west opens into a large, rounded burrow. 
The walls have been roughly dug, and bear many scratches. 
Rounded on all sides, the burrow is bowl-shaped, and is filled 
with bones, scraps of metal and other equipment, and various 
mounds of fur and cloth. Feces stain many of the bones a much 
darker color, and the air is thick with the smell of it.

   The roughly dug tunnel twists gently here in several spots,

Several large, rough stones lie half exposed in the wall. In 
many places there are scratches of some sort on the surface of 
the rocks, highlighted in each instance as they are a much 
lighter grey than the rest of the stone. Bones of various sizes 
line the floor of the tunnel.

Outside of the Battlements of the Walled Village~
   Impossible to climb without the aid of a ladder or perhaps 
grappling hook, and a guaranteed quick fall to the ground for 
those who haven't come prepared thusly, the space of air exists 
outside the reinforced and expertly constructed battlement of the 
walled village, offering a somewhat pleasant view of the 
surrounding South Ithilien farmlands.

Fog Covered Wood~
   Murky light from the sun labors through the densely woven 
branches far above the woodland floor, adding indistinct shadows 
to the fog-enshrouded space below the high canopy. The tree 
trunks rise, slender and black, straight and tall up through the 
fog, their rough bark glistening with moisture. Silence lays 
heavily here, the sounds of the traveler stepping through the 
feeble red-brown grass are shockingly loud.

Eerie Shrouded Wood~
   The fog presses in upon the rare traveler who ventures here, 
weighted down with silence. Slender black trunks stretch up 
straight and tall, branchless until the very top, where weak 
twisted arms sparsely adorned with long thin needles crawl across 
the sky, inextricably intertwined with those of neighboring 
trees. The rough bark of the closely-spaced trees is slick with 
moisture, and reddish-brown patches of sparse grass struggle for 
survival on the shadowed floor of the wood.

Tree Bearing Fungus~
   Thick slabs of oozing disc-shaped fungus jut from the bark of 
one twisted trunk in a wood of otherwise unmarred straight 
slender trunks. An unpleasant scent is present near this one 
tree, adding to the oppressive atmosphere in the fog-darkened, 
heavy air beneath the tall evergreens. The marked silence of 
this wood is startling, for there is no rattling of small animals 
foraging, nor birdsong, nor even the sound of insects. There is 
only the wood, and the fog.

A Foggy Evergreen Wood~
   A grey fog lays still upon the woodland floor, stirring only 
with the passage of infrequent travelers. The light of the sun 
filters dimly through the scraggly tops of the evergreens, 
drawing white streaks through the shadowy mist below. The 
undergrowth is sparse, consisting of thin, reddish-brown grasses 
growing knee-high in the heavy shadowy air. The trees are quite 
tall, their thin trunks straight and dark, slick with moisture 
from the fog. No branches grow upon them except at the very top, 
and the trees grow closely together.

Tall Conifers in a Foggy Wood~
   The densely packed trunks of trees draw black vertical lines 
through a muted fog, their sparse top branches covered with long 
green needles. Red-brown grass covers the ground in thin patchy 
sections, growing knee high on an average man, round stalks 
fanning out at the top into cloudy arrays seeking in vain for 
sunlight. The air hangs heavy beneath the evergreens, as if the 
wood holds its breath. There is no sound of birdsong or any 
rustling of small animals about, nor even drone of insects.

Murky Woodland~
   Black, slender trunks covered with rough bark stretch far 
above the woodland floor, devoid of branches until the unruly, 
twisting, intertwined canopy of weak twigs and thin needles. The 
heavy air beneath is laced with fog and silence; nothing stirs 
but that disturbed by the rare passerby. The sparse, red-brown 
grass grows in sickly patches underfoot, moisture glistening on 
the blades. Sunlight seems as if it is consciously held back by 
the fog and the branches above, pushing through in murky streaks.

Fire-touched Stone Basement Occupied by Nests of Scraps and Fur~
   What was once the basement and lower floor of an opulent manor 
has been subjected to the occupation of the Gothakra orcs and 
goblins that hold this town, the divide between the basement and 
floor knocked out to form a ramp of packed rubble that leads 
westward to a large, circular, wooden door. Nests composed of 
scraps of fur, linen and wool litter this broad floor, some 
occupied by napping orcs and goblins, others by baleful wargs. A 
series of cages have been built along the northern wall, home to 
more violent mounts, and a tunnel hacked in the southern edge of 
the room leads downward.

Bare, Dug Out, Earthen Tunnel~
   Dug out of the ground, this tunnel leads from the ceiling, 
twisting towards the west. In the centre of the tunnel, the 
walls expand, and the uneven floor has been stamped flat, 
creating a large, circular, bare area of which the floors are 
stained with sticky fluids. At the western end of the tunnel, a 
secure gate leads north, and a ornate totem composed of heads and 
scalps is set before a solid door.

Subterranean Armoury~
   There is little to this armoury of the Gothakra caverns; racks 
and shelves and chests and stands line the walls, most stuffed 
with rotting and crude leathers, but a few choice pieces of 
armour can be spotted here and there amongst the crates and 
barrels and boxes. The walls, floor and ceiling is hard earth, 
reinforced with wooden props, and a solid gate of iron leads 
southwards.

Boss Quarters of the Cave~
   The wood-propped walls of this earthern cave are decorates 
with tattered banners, skulls, skeletons of all manner of 
creatures and totems, all part of the long legacy of the clan 
Gothakra. Only a number of nests occupy these quarters, each of 
them behind a secluded section of ragged curtains to give them 
more privacy, and each of the nest being made up of fine 
materials such as velvet, silk, and properly treated bear furs. 
To the east, a solid, secure door leads out to the greater 
warrens of the caverns.

Gothakra Troop Purcahse~
   This room is considered "Out Of Character", and exists due to 
coded necessity. If you do not have leadership in the Gothakra 
Clan, please leave immediately, or face summary execution. Here, 
through typing list, you can see what troops are availabe for 
recruitment by Gothakra. All troops come naked, clanned to 
Gothakra as private, and clanned to Tur Edendor to avoid being 
attacked by the archers there. 

Troops can arrive from wherever you wish to roleplay them from; 
young orcs and goblins coming of warrior age within the tribe, 
veterans from Gothakra camps in the mountains of Ered Lithui, 
noted fighters of other tribes that have been accepted in to the 
clan, etc. The cash payment for troops is considered to be 
arranging their traveling expenses and paying for a life time's 
supply of NPC food. You will be able to name each soldier that 
you buy; finding an orc or goblin name generator will help 
immensely with this. 

An explanation of the terms; 
   #6aggro#0: the soldier will attack, whether melee or bow, 
anyone it sees or scans within range that is not part of the same 
clan as it is. 
   #6wanderer#0: the soldier will not stay still, but instead 
walk about on their own. Will remain in line if following 
someone. 
   #6tough#0: the soldier is more hardy and resilient than most, 
reflection by a natural armour bonus.

Outside of the Battlements of the Walled Village~
   Impossible to climb without the aid of a ladder or perhaps 
grappling hook, and a guaranteed quick fall to the ground for 
those who haven't come prepared thusly, the space of air exists 
outside the reinforced and expertly constructed battlement of the

   A thick portcullis has been set into the northern wood wall of 
this vast gatehouse and a few pieces of dark furniture have been 
placed around the room. Set in the southern wall is a crude, 
black wooden gate, a small grated shutter apparent in its surface 
and dark iron torch holders have been affixed to the walls to 
cast forth flickering, ample light over this dark room.

Beneath the Northern Gatehouse~
   A thick, dark wooden gate restricts access north of this 
gatehouse whilst a portcullis does the same in a southern 
direction. Easily in sight is the broad cobbled road which 
passes through this town, its surface dominated by the footfall 
of the farmers, workers and soldiers of the place and, whilst 
appearing busy and somewhat hectic, an uncomfortable atmosphere 
is certainly apparent. The room is rather poorly ventilated and 
the umber wood of what this gatehouse is made is carefully 
infused with the dank, musty smell of earth underfoot. A few 
iron grates hold in them torches of flickering orange light which 
casts forth onto the shadow dark room, not all corners relieved 
of their dark envelope.

On a Stair in the Cathedral's Presbytery~
   This staircase, made of black iron spiraling up in a recess 
cut out of the marble, continues to climb the spire. The first 
thing one passes on the way up the stairs is a small archway 
leading out to the north, through which fresh air can be smelt. 
A little further up and around the staircase, an door with iron 
banding and a large lock leads westward, and the staircase itself 
continues up the spire. The walls are completely unadorned save 
for the odd torch, which provides all the light in here.

A Luscious, Open-Air Cloister~
   This cloister is a roofed walkway with many arched pillars 
around a lush green garden. It is not overly large, but it is 
certainly large enough. The two-storey walls that surround it 
give it complete privacy, and also protect it from the elements a 
good deal. The stones are all covered in a vibrant moss, and 
vines snake up around the columns, though they are quite young 
and were probably planted there on purpose. A few small shrubs 
and a young alder tree are the only non-grass vegetation in the 
garden, but it is still a rather serene place to be.

The walls are bare, the room is very clean, and the only windows 
are small quatrefoils at about head height that allow only a

   This small veranda has an excellent view of the high altar, 
and is also in an excellent position to receive the acoustics of 
the Cathedral. The walls are lined with expensive silken 
tapestries showing Melkor's victories over the Valar, and several 
of his most prominent Balrog generals. The floor is covered in a 
soft, deep crimson carpet, and the air smells of lavender.

   This room is complete empty, save for a small bronze altar 
that sits in the very middle, on a slight pedestal. There are 
three windows, on the west, east, and north walls of this room, 
however they have hatches, and can be slid shut. The ground is 
the same dark grey marble as the rest of the cathedral, however 
it has a consistent brown tinge to it around the altar. There 
are no built in light sources.

   This room is in many ways exposed to the weather, being at the

by four pillars, and no walls. An enormous bronze bell hangs 
here, able to be tolled by a thick length of silken rope that 
hangs below it. A stair leads back down into the spire from 
here. The view from this position extends many miles in all

The Second Storey of a Small Wooden House~
   The recently built wooden floor creaks as one moves about in 
this room, making it virtually impossible to move around 
stealthily. There are no windows in this room, however, a square 
shaped shaft has been cut in the roof and what looks to be a left 
over lead glass window from the Cathedral has been put over the 
top, creating an out of place skylight. There are two doors on 
this floor, and this hallway is not a very spacious place to 
linger.

A North-Facing Bedroom~
   This small room, evidently designed as some kind of bedroom, 
faces north and has a huge shuttered window on the northern wall 
- catching the sun all day during winter, and largely shaded 
during the summer. The floors and walls are the same unadorned 
old growth pine as the rest of the house, and there isn't much to 
speak of.

An Open-Plan Bedroom~
   This bedroom is a little larger than the other one, though it 
has windows on the west and south walls and so catches a lot of 
late afternoon sun, making it often hot and muggy. The floors 
and walls are recently made, but not overly great material, and 
the door has a big bronze handle but doesn't have a locking 
mechanism.

A Kitchen Area~
   This small room, with an doorless entry way leading back into 
the main room, has but one high and small window. Around half of 
the floor of this room is roughly cut stone rather than wood, and 
there are numerous benchtops for putting things on.

Upon the Repaired Stone Wall, Before the Battlements~
   Although the walls have been fashioned of hard stone, they 
looked to have been damaged many times in recent past. They have 
been repaired with both lumber and mismatching pieces of rock, 
allowing one perhaps a desperate attempt to climb up upon them 
and get to the battlements. 
   This vantage point allows a good view of the western 
Ithillien.

A Large, Arch-Roofed Hall~
   This hall is quite large, stretching in a squarish oblong with 
a major axes along the north-south. The floor is made of 
polished marble, and a black and white map of the island of 
Numenor has been worked into the placement of the floor slabs. 
The roof is supported by two large circular columns, and comes to 
an apex nearly a storey higher than the walls in a long, 
relatively plain arch. The walls have many shields upon them 
with various coat-of-arms, and there is a corridor that continues 
to the east.

The Office of the Lord Chancellor~
   This rather large office has a short, several yard 'hallway' 
leading into it, forcing anyone who enters to be in full central 
view of the main desk as they enter. The roof is relatively high 
and a large, exquisite chandelier hangs, with many red candles 
lit. The floor is polished marble, but the walls are completely 
unadorned stained timber.

The Office of the Chief Prelate~
   This is the office of the chief Prelate, and the walls are 
accordingly decorated with paraphernalia appropriate to the CUlt 
of Morgoth - several motifs of historical scenes, and a few 
pieces of art. The office itself is actually not overly large, 
and is lit with a single large oil torch that hangs on the far 
wall from the door.

The Office of the Usher~
   Well-polished marble of swirling patterns compose this modest 
offices floor. Panels of stained hardwood have been fitted to 
the base masonry to formulate the walls an skirting. A few 
pieces of furniture are set in a few of this rooms corner and 
lavish paintings have been hooked to the surrounding walls for 
decoration. About the desk central to the room is usually strewn 
with parchment pieces blotted with dark inks and a tall door 
gives leave to entrance and exit to the north of this room. But 
a few iron-composed hooks have been set in intervals about the 
room in to which torches can be set, offering the room ample 
light in lieu of window frames.

A Tidy Corridor~
   This Corridor is neat and utilitarian - the walls and floors 
much the same as the rest of the complex, but unadorned. 
Compared to the main entry corridor to the building, it is short, 
and there are two doors either side of the corridor and one at 
it's end. The door to the North has a bull and lioness engraved 
upon it; the door to the East has an image of a pile of coins and 
a quill pen upon it; the door to the south has a pair of crossed 
blades.

   This office would be larger except for the large amount of 
furniture, which makes it feel cramped and small. From what 
little can be seen of the wall, it appears to be the same stained 
hardwood as the rest of the building, and the floor is certainly 
the same marble.

   This room is quite large and oblong shaped, stretching along 
the east-west side of the building. It has no windows or access 
to the outside but for the heavy, reinforced iron door at the 
northeastern end of the room, and the floors look to be heavy, 
extensive slabs of granite - possibly laid to stop attempts to 
dig into the room. The walls are made of the same timber 
hardwood as the rest of the place but have been reinforced with 
metal latticing.

A Busy Stables~
   Open and airy, this large barn smells pleasantly of grassy 
hay, leather, and horses. The atmosphere is generally quiet, 
with only slight rustling and the contented sounds of chewing 
floating over the air. A central aisle runs past a long row of 
standing stalls, each with a hay rack and hitch where the 
occupants are tied facing the wall. At the far end, a few loose 
boxes allow roomier accommodations, with a window in each and the 
floors lined with straw. The floor is packed earth, swept clean 
but scattered with bits of straw and hay nonetheless, and above 
the stalls is a loft, stacked high with grassy hay. A few stray 
spider webs collect in high corners, but the building is 
otherwise clean and well cared-for.

Atop An Island Housing Some Stone Ruins~
   Approaching this island from any direction would force one to 
tread through the almost shoulder-deep morass of the marshes, the 
black, still water cold and somehow deadening to both spirit and 
flesh, making each clammy and cold. As progress was made towards 
the center of the area, however, the trespassers to this area of 
the marshes would feel the treacherous, slick ground beneath 
their feet slanting upwards towards the island. Having finally 
surmounted the wet ground of the melancholy island, there would 
be a number of ruins sprawled about the small place of semi-dry 
land to examine.

Atop Slime-Ridden Stairs~
   These stairs form a small valley that lead downwards between 
large hills of stone rubble, its path moving down into the below 
darkness. The stairs themselves, while still intact, are coated 
with a thick layer of wet, muddy filth that seems to have seeped 
down from above, covering the length of the stairs. The smell of 
rotted vegetation and disturbed, ancient muck remains strong as 
any trespassers into this area move through it.

A Vast, Lichen-Roofed Basement~
   Aside from the stairway that is flush attached to the northern 
wall, this large stone room is almost entirely barren. The 
marshland above it, however, have taken their toll as all sorts 
of plants and roots have begin to slowly sprout their way through 
the ceiling and dangle down into the faces and heads of 
trespassers. The floor, too, is coated in a finger-deep layer of 
wet muck that would need to be walked through for progress to be 
made, its composition slick and treacherous atop the old stone. 
All in all, the atmosphere of this room is dreary and hard on the 
senses due to the slickened floor, dank atmosphere, and dark 
surroundings. Bits of rotted wood lay atop the floor in very 
frequent places, and small bits of metal and glass, as well, can 
be found beneath the muck. Rather than a formal staircase or 
other usual mode of transportation, a slime-slickened, rusted 
ladder has been stuck into the western wall permitting those 
present to climb down.

A Rotted, Corrupted Bedroom~
   This room is accessible via a small doorway set in the western 
wall, their stone composition holding stolid against the 
insidious workings of the various plants and sludge of the 
Marshes. This room here still holds all of the remnants of a 
life: a shattered bookshelf, its tomes all gone, a rotted chest 
that's been cracked open sometime in the past, and a bed, its 
covers and blankets savaged by the muck of the atmosphere. There 
are still remnants of a few paintings and tapestries hanging 
about the walls, forlorn and ruined.

   While the stone beneath the feet of any travelers is still 
solid and dependable, the omnipresent layer of muck and black 
water is still present, making travel still difficult. This room 
here appears to have been a pantry or storeroom of some sort, 
shattered crates and gaping-open pantries abound in this room, 
some cast down onto the floor, some just hanging ajar. Between 
the muck on the floor, the remnants of a civilized life, and the 
roots hanging at head-height from the ceiling, the forlorn aura 
of this room seems complete.

A Laboratory of Broken Tools and Shattered Cages~
   Heavy stone tables, now covered with dust and other such signs 
of lack of use, number throughout this area, standing silent and 
still as the muck pools around them. At irregular intervals 
around the room signs of ancient carnage are present: shelves 
that have been ripped from walls, cages that have been rent open, 
and odd, rusted metal items that protrude from the muck. The 
cages seem to number somehwere in the handful and, despite their 
chaotic pattern, seem to all be grouped near the western wall. 
Oil-less lanterns and other such fixtures still hang from the 
walls, but no signs of large life are present.

An Underground Observatory~
   The stonemasonry of past rooms stops abruptly here at the 
doorframe, moving no farther. Dug far enough beneath the surface 
to where the dirt is still dry and solid, this area seems to have 
simply been a circular room cut directly into the dirt, with just 
wooden supports justting from floor to ceiling being the only 
signs of modern digging methods. The floor and walls are both of 
dirt, with the roots that are emerging from the ceiling hanging 
lower here than their counterparts in other places. In the very 
middle of the area, as if the rest had been built and dug out 
around it, dead vegetation lies, bereft of life.

Steeply Inclining Mountain Trail~
   Broken by the infrequent crumbling rock the untamed, mountain 
trail continues in a steep incline while a natural arch of rock 
swings the trail eastwards and down. The wind's constant howl 
tears at the loose soil within this strange natural ravine. 
Stubborn shrubs poke up through hard rugged, ground littered with 
rock. The broken trunk of a long dead tree marks the landscape. 
The trail continues around the mountain into a narrow gorge-like 
pass.

indiscernible way as it continues its steep wind around the 
mountain. The path is wide and flat here, the ground solid 
underfoot. It divides here, with one fork going away to the 
west, while the main trail follows the edge of the cliff to the 
north. Rugged brush, is scattered across the trail and the wind 
howls shrilly here as it passes through the crags and boulders 
along the mountain side. A shear drop to the cliff below makes 
passage over the rotting wood of the felled tree, treacherous.

   Snaking around a huge, black boulder, the way continues 
cutting a narrow path along the ravine-edge from south to east. 
Hardly discernable, the trail here borders a sheer drop down the 
east side of the black rock. It narrows to a point where only a 
single traveler may pass near the east where there is visible a 
narrow stone bridge crossing the ravine from one side to the 
other. The wind tears at the mountain bearing down on the sparse 
scrub relentlessly. Footing is difficult on the gravely pathway 
causing travel to slow.

loose gravel gives way to the rock beneath covered with a thin 
layer of grey soil. A small outcropping of rock offers a sturdy 
hand hold against the almost vertical path. The wind whistles a 
haunting tune through the limbs of the lone tree. The trail

Narrow Stone Bridge Over a Steep Ravine~
   This bridge is quite old, and the stone is rough and pitted. 
While it is extremely thick and strong, it does not appear to be 
the work of master stonemasons. Rather it is a rough and pitted 
finger of rock carved solely to allow singular travel across the 
treacherous ravine below. Wind whips at the area, causing even 
the spiny shrubs on either side of the bridge to bend in protest.

rise all around and the distant cawing of a bird of prey can be 
faintly heard over the gurgling of the water. Immediately above 
is a stone bridge spanning the gap and a narrow trail leads away

Ravine Trail Before a Large Cavernous Opening~
   At the bottom of the ravine the trail here was once blocked by 
a large slab of rock. A rockslide since has knocked it aside, 
revealing a large, cavernous opening. A tunnel beyond descends 
into the black rock of the mountain and the air smells stale and 
musty. The face of the rock above is broken and bears the scars 
of the rockslide. The wind seems to whistle from the black rocks 
themselves.

Large Cavernous Opening In the Mountain~
   A rockslide outside the cavern has revealed the entrance and 
the interior is large and barren. The opening is more or less 
round, and inside the floor is rough and dusty. Stalactites hang 
from the shadowed ceiling and the air is quite still. To the 
south an immense stone doorway once blocked any passage deeper 
into the caves though it is cracked and weakened now and is 
wedged open.

niches of privacy in the wide underground expanse. The ever 
present dripping echos throughout the cavern and several smaller 
tunnels branch off to the east, west and south.

ceiling. The walls bevel inward sparkling with calcium crystals 
like stars against the night sky. The dripping is softer here.

ceiling to floor here forcing travelers to bend as they pass 
through this uneven rock corridor. Ancient calcium flakes 
glitter from the rock walls like surface fireflies dancing across 
a field in the darkness. The passage tilts in a slightly 
downward direction as it continues through the mountain.

At a Natural Rock Stair~
   The passageway turns here, on an angle from west to the south. 
It is reasonably wide and the floor smooth enough for easy 
travel. To the east a tunnel descends steeply into the darkness 
while the main tunnel angles away. The air is still and dusty 
here, though a chill breeze blows up from below. A natural rock 
stair leads down.

Very Steep Rock Passage~
   The continuing corridor from above slants sharply here at a 
dizzying angle. Passage is difficult with the jagged walls 
shedding razor sharp flakes of rock outwards clawing at passerby. 
The floor is rugged and uneven. The pathway is almost torn by 
time but solid underfoot. The wind howls through the tunnel here 
entering from some unseen crack to the surface, drowning out the 
constant echo of dripping water.

A Jagged Passage~
   Jagged walls form an eerie path through the ancient cave as 
the dark corridor winds through the mountain. Here the walls 
seem to tilt into themselves forcing a crooked path though the 
rock. Glittering calcium crystals give the illusion of motion to 
the solid walls. The floor is almost smooth as if water worn the 
path smooth over the ages. Dripping echos ceaselessly throughout 
the caverns its source unseen.

Decorated Cavern Near an Underground Waterfall~
   The passages from the north and west open wide to a wide 
chamber on the edge of a sheer drop to the east. From a hidden 
source above, murky waters fall down past the chamber and over 
the edge of the drop to crash into a pool somewhere below. 
Naturally formed columns separate the room into quadrants, at odd 
angles to each other. The floor of the cavern is almost smooth 
and proves little obstacle under foot, and the air is quite moist 
from the spray.

Twising Rock Passsages~
   The tunnel passages all converge here at a rough intersection, 
widening to allow easy travel over the water smoothed rock floor. 
To the east, waterfalls of white flowstone render beautiful 
formations carved from the ages of an underground rush of water 
across its rock surface. The ceiling angles downward displaying 
fine jagged cracks across its width. The distant sound of 
rushing water drowns out the ever present echoing drip that fills 
the passages. The main cavern lies to the north and in 
particular here there is a wide natural stone stair that descends 
sharply to the south.

A Sharp Descending Passage~
   Dropping down sharply from up to below, this tunnel is 
cramped, ragged and moist. There is a loud dripping coming from 
below, and the air is eerily chilly. Bones litter the floor and 
rock formations jut out from all angles, making passage up or 
down difficult.

A Rounded Cavern~
   The tunnel from the north comes upon a cavern that is large, 
and round-shaped. It has a curved ceiling, apart from the 
teeth-like stalactites above, and the floor is reasonably smooth 
except for the crumbled stone debris littering it. Stalagmites 
rise up from the floor, dividing the room naturally into 
sections. Westwards an opening seems to lead to a small obscured 
woodland area.

from the rock walls like surface fireflies dancing across a field 
in the darkness. The natural rock stair cuts its way through the 
rough rock.

Widening Uneven Passage Before a Grotto~
   The passage opens up like a yawning mouth of a great beast 
from north to south, its stalagmites and stalactites almost tooth 
like in appearance. The passage widens at the lower end, narrows 
in the distance forcing a traveler to bend to pass along its 
massive rock outcropping through the narrow confines of the stone 
corridor. The wind whistles through the narrow passage its 
entrance and destination unknown. There is great moisture in the 
air.

Underground Grotto at the Base of a Waterfall~
   A narrow rock corridor stretches into the mountain from the 
north, its ceiling at a sickening angle to the uneven stone 
floor, broken in spots which form natural steps. As the floor 
flattens the walls bevel in odd directions almost like waves in 
the sea. Stalagmites poke up from the floor reaching to join 
with their stalactite mates, dripping the acidic liquid that 
brings them together over the centuries. The air is fresh here, 
renewed by the wind whistling in from a crack in the surface. 
From a shaft directly above a spray of murky water falls into a 
deep pool at the base of this grotto.

Great Cathedral-Like Cavern~
   Hollowed out by time and water, this cavern expands in all 
directions forming a natural cathedral of jagged black rock. The 
ceiling angles upward from two sides forming a sharp angle where 
they meet high above the solid rock floor. Nooks hewed by the 
hand of time, uneven and oddly placed, lend almost a hive look to 
the walls of the cavern. A huge flat rock, table like in size, 
sits almost in the center of rock chamber. 
   Many small tunnels lead away from this chamber.

   This natural depression in the rough rock wall is wide and

odd and uneven directions. The ceiling tilts at a sickening

twisting, intertwined canopy of weak twigs and thin needles. The 
heavy air beneath is laced with fog and silence; nothing stirs 
but that disturbed by the rare passerby. The sparse, red-brown 
grass grows in sickly patches underfoot, moisture glistening on 
the blades. Sunlight seems as if it is consciously held back by 
the fog and the branches above, pushing through in murky streaks.

feeble red-brown grass are shockingly loud.

twisted arms sparsely adorned with long thin needles crawl across 
the sky, inextricably intertwined with those of neighboring 
trees. The rough bark of the closely-spaced trees is slick with 
moisture, and reddish-brown patches of sparse grass struggle for 
survival on the shadowed floor of the wood.

tree, adding to the oppressive atmosphere in the fog-darkened, 
heavy air beneath the tall evergreens. The marked silence of

foraging, nor birdsong, nor even the sound of insects. There is 
only the wood, and the fog.

drawing white streaks through the shadowy mist below. The 
undergrowth is sparse, consisting of thin, reddish-brown grasses 
growing knee-high in the heavy shadowy air. The trees are quite 
tall, their thin trunks straight and dark, slick with moisture 
from the fog. No branches grow upon them except at the very top, 
and the trees grow closely together.

rustling of small animals about, nor even drone of insects.

Murky Woodland~
   Black, slender trunks covered with rough bark stretch far 
above the woodland floor, devoid of branches until the unruly, 
twisting, intertwined canopy of weak twigs and thin needles. The 
heavy air beneath is laced with fog and silence; nothing stirs 
but that disturbed by the rare passerby. The sparse, red-brown 
grass grows in sickly patches underfoot, moisture glistening on 
the blades. Sunlight seems as if it is consciously held back by 
the fog and the branches above, pushing through in murky streaks.

Fog Covered Wood~
   Murky light from the sun labors through the densely woven 
branches far above the woodland floor, adding indistinct shadows 
to the fog-enshrouded space below the high canopy. The tree 
trunks rise, slender and black, straight and tall up through the 
fog, their rough bark glistening with moisture. Silence lays 
heavily here, the sounds of the traveler stepping through the 
feeble red-brown grass are shockingly loud.

Eerie Shrouded Wood~
   The fog presses in upon the rare traveler who ventures here, 
weighted down with silence. Slender black trunks stretch up 
straight and tall, branchless until the very top, where weak 
twisted arms sparsely adorned with long thin needles crawl across 
the sky, inextricably intertwined with those of neighboring 
trees. The rough bark of the closely-spaced trees is slick with 
moisture, and reddish-brown patches of sparse grass struggle for 
survival on the shadowed floor of the wood.

Tree Bearing Fungus~
   Thick slabs of oozing disc-shaped fungus jut from the bark of 
one twisted trunk in a wood of otherwise unmarred straight 
slender trunks. An unpleasant scent is present near this one 
tree, adding to the oppressive atmosphere in the fog-darkened, 
heavy air beneath the tall evergreens. The marked silence of 
this wood is startling, for there is no rattling of small animals 
foraging, nor birdsong, nor even the sound of insects. There is 
only the wood, and the fog.

A Foggy Evergreen Wood~
   A grey fog lays still upon the woodland floor, stirring only 
with the passage of infrequent travelers. The light of the sun 
filters dimly through the scraggly tops of the evergreens, 
drawing white streaks through the shadowy mist below. The 
undergrowth is sparse, consisting of thin, reddish-brown grasses 
growing knee-high in the heavy shadowy air. The trees are quite 
tall, their thin trunks straight and dark, slick with moisture 
from the fog. No branches grow upon them except at the very top, 
and the trees grow closely together.

Tall Conifers in a Foggy Wood~
   The densely packed trunks of trees draw black vertical lines 
through a muted fog, their sparse top branches covered with long 
green needles. Red-brown grass covers the ground in thin patchy 
sections, growing knee high on an average man, round stalks 
fanning out at the top into cloudy arrays seeking in vain for 
sunlight. The air hangs heavy beneath the evergreens, as if the 
wood holds its breath. There is no sound of birdsong or any 
rustling of small animals about, nor even drone of insects.

A Low Range of Hills Below the Cliffs of the Emyn Muil~
   Stretching into the distance towards the east is a low range 
of hills, barren and devoid of nearly everything but the 
occasional twisted, petrified tree. Bands of alternating colored 
rock sometimes mar the surface of the hills, the rich ochre, 
crimsons and greys striping through the vastness of the rock. 
Just within sight is another range, this one stretching a little 
bit beyond the first. To the north and the west, the cliffs of 
the Emyn Muil rise sharply.

A Small Gully Between Hills~
   Cleft between the gently heaving hills of the range, a gully 
cuts through the land like a writhing band. What was probably 
once a small stream has dried to only dust and rock and the 
occasional struggling bit of plant life peering from beneath the 
loose soil. Within the gully itself, sheltered by the wind, 
yellowish grass and sandbars line the sides and bottom, sometimes 
even obscuring the rock bottom. The ever present cliffs of the 
Emyn Muil blocking passage northwards.

The Windward Side of a Snaking Hill~
   Sinking down into a low valley before the rise of another 
rolling hill, the land snakes and twists to the valley floor. 
The sand seems to have mostly blown from this face of the hill, 
leaving only a tough yellow clay and sharp bits of broken shale 
in its wake. No bushes or vegetation sprouts from the blasted 
soil here, it's remarkable only in its barren serenity. Steep 
cliffs of rock rise to the north.

Atop A Windblown Hilltop~
   Blasted by wind and sun, the earlier loose sand of the hill 
has given way to a hard-baked yellow clay. Split and cracked in 
spider-web patterns all across the hilltop, the clay holds 
half-buried bits of rock and sediment in its ancient grip. A 
grove of dried and burned-out pines still lingers on the small 
butte, but most of the trees have fallen to rest atop the rock, 
fire-blackened and destroyed. Overlooking the range of hills in 
the distance is a small set of cairns, the ancient stones worn 
smooth by the passage of time. Any markings have long since 
faded, until only the stones remain.

Upon the Slope of a Sandy Hill~
   Rough and jagged patches of stone interweave with stretches of 
broken sand, crumbling underfoot. The occasional half-buried 
root stretches across the loose shale to catch the unwary 
travelers passing. Rarely a tuft of greyish grass can be seen, 
struggling up from the sand and rock to lift towards the sky. 
More often, tufts of dry and yellowed grass linger amid the sharp 
stones, lifeless.

Before the Slope of a Rocky Hill~
   Strewn along the dusty, loose soil is an assortment of 
palm-sized, sharp shale rock. Here and there a stunted, 
misshapen bush lurks amid the stones and dirt, though almost 
without fail the leaves have faded to a pale brown from lack of 
water and too much sun. A small stand of dead trees rests on the 
leeward side of the valley, the broken and snapped branches still 
reaching towards the sky. In the distance lie a set of low, 
rolling hills, each as barren as the tiny valley nestled between 
them.

A Narrow Trail Passing Through a Thin Wood~
   Thick slabs of oozing disc-shaped fungus jut from the bark of 
one twisted trunk in a wood of otherwise unmarred straight 
slender trunks. An unpleasant scent is present near this one 
tree, adding to the oppressive atmosphere in the fog-darkened, 
heavy air beneath the tall evergreens. The marked silence of 
this wood is startling, for there is no rattling of small animals 
foraging, nor birdsong, nor even the sound of insects. A narrow 
trail wends its way between the trees, occasional faint side 
trails barely visible, ending at the base of the cliffs of the 
Emyn Muil that rise to the north.

Eerie Shrouded Wood~
   The fog presses in upon the rare traveler who ventures here, 
weighted down with silence. Slender black trunks stretch up 
straight and tall, branchless until the very top, where weak 
twisted arms sparsely adorned with long thin needles crawl across 
the sky, inextricably intertwined with those of neighboring 
trees. The rough bark of the closely-spaced trees is slick with 
moisture, and reddish-brown patches of sparse grass struggle for 
survival on the shadowed floor of the wood.

Murky Woodland Beneath the Cliffs of the Emyn Muil~
   Black, slender trunks covered with rough bark stretch far 
above the woodland floor, devoid of branches until the unruly, 
twisting, intertwined canopy of weak twigs and thin needles. The 
heavy air beneath is laced with fog and silence; nothing stirs 
but that disturbed by the rare passerby. The sparse, red-brown 
grass grows in sickly patches underfoot, moisture glistening on 
the blades. Sunlight seems as if it is consciously held back by 
the fog and the branches above, pushing through in murky streaks.

A Fog Covered Wood Against Steep Cliffs~
   Murky light from the sun labors through the densely woven 
branches far above the woodland floor, adding indistinct shadows 
to the fog-enshrouded space below the high canopy. The tree 
trunks rise, slender and black, straight and tall up through the 
fog, their rough bark glistening with moisture. Silence lays 
heavily here, the sounds of the traveler stepping through the 
feeble red-brown grass are shockingly loud.

through a muted fog, their sparse top branches covered with long 
green needles. Red-brown grass covers the ground in thin patchy 
sections, growing knee high on an average man, round stalks 
fanning out at the top into cloudy arrays seeking in vain for

wood holds its breath. There is no sound of birdsong or any 
rustling of small animals about, nor even drone of insects.

Deep Within a Foggy Wood of Evergreen~
   A grey fog lays still upon the woodland floor, stirring only 
with the passage of infrequent travelers. The light of the sun 
filters dimly through the scraggly tops of the evergreens, 
drawing white streaks through the shadowy mist below. The 
undergrowth is sparse, consisting of thin, reddish-brown grasses 
growing knee-high in the heavy shadowy air. The trees are quite 
tall, their thin trunks straight and dark, slick with moisture 
from the fog. No branches grow upon them except at the very top, 
and the trees grow closely together.

A Rocky Expanse~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the 
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large 
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping 
winds of the plains quickly blowing away this light covering of 
soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of 
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of the Dagorlad.

   From east to west the Dagorlad rolls down in a gently sloped 
plain, the flat fields offering one a fine view of the major 
landmarks of the area the imposing mountain range that is the 
eastern horizon, the evergreen forest of cedars and spruces 
clustered about the Emyn Muil plateau to the north west, a hard 
spit of rock with a solid fort constructed upon it to the south, 
and the boggy lands where the River Anduin meets another, smaller 
stream to the south-west.

In a Shallow Valley~
   On either side of the road gentle hills rise up, their slopes 
support verdant life in the form of trees and shrubbery which 
grow almost to the edge of the clearly defined path upon which 
you find yourself. In the winter months, while denuded of 
leaves, the hardwoods still evidence their health while in the 
warmer seasons their viridian coronal splendor is held aloft for 
all to witness.

cuts through the land like a writhing band. What was probably 
once a small stream has dried to only dust and rock and the 
occasional struggling bit of plant life peering from beneath the 
loose soil. Within the gully itself, sheltered by the wind, 
yellowish grass and sandbars line the sides and bottom, sometimes 
even obscuring the rock bottom.

The Windward Side of a Snaking Hill~
   Sinking down into a low valley before the rise of another 
rolling hill, the land snakes and twists to the valley floor. 
The sand seems to have mostly blown from this face of the hill, 
leaving only a tough yellow clay and sharp bits of broken shale 
in its wake. No bushes or vegetation sprouts from the blasted 
soil here, it's remarkable only in its barren serenity.

spider-web patterns all across the hilltop, the clay holds 
half-buried bits of rock and sediment in its ancient grip. A 
grove of dried and burned-out pines still lingers on the small 
butte, but most of the trees have fallen to rest atop the rock, 
fire-blackened and destroyed. Overlooking the range of hills in 
the distance is a small set of cairns, the ancient stones worn 
smooth by the passage of time. Any markings have long since 
faded, until only the stones remain.

High-Grass Lands About A Hillock~
   The ground underfoot here varies greatly as it stretches 
across untold miles of the far northern Ithilien. From broken 
puddles of muddy water to soggy soil, all punctured by the 
occasional outcropping of dark rock, there is little in the way 
to support easy travel across the heathland, yet alone 
habitation. A steady silence hangs in the air, the uninhabited 
bog set far from civilization, though the occasional rustling of 
grass betrays the presence of some life.

Between of a Series of Buttes~
   Looming like great hunks of misshapen earth, a series of 
large, flat-topped hills rise into the distance. Gullies and 
ravines cut between the hunched rises of barren stone, 
proclaiming that water might've once flowed through, but no 
longer. Instead, the cracked and parched earth stands mute of 
birdsong and all but devoid of life, the occasional twisted, 
petrified tree-trunk or large boulder marking the shallow valleys 
between the hills.

Atop A Windblown Hilltop~
   Blasted by wind and sun, the earlier loose sand of the hill 
has given way to a hard-baked yellow clay. Split and cracked in 
spider-web patterns all across the hilltop, the clay holds 
half-buried bits of rock and sediment in its ancient grip. A 
grove of dried and burned-out pines still lingers on the small 
butte, but most of the trees have fallen to rest atop the rock, 
fire-blackened and destroyed. Overlooking the range of hills in 
the distance is a small set of cairns, the ancient stones worn 
smooth by the passage of time. Any markings have long since 
faded, until only the stones remain.

A Low Range of Hills~
   Stretching into the distance is a low range of hills, barren 
and devoid of nearly everything but the occasional twisted, 
petrified tree. Bands of alternating colored rock sometimes mar 
the surface of the hills, the rich ochre, crimsons and greys 
striping through the vastness of the rock. Just within sight is 
another range, this one stretching a little bit beyond the first.

A Small Gully Opening Deeper Into the Mountains of Shadow~
   Cleft between the gently heaving hills of the range, a gully 
cuts through the land like a writhing band. What was probably 
once a small stream has dried to only dust and rock and the 
occasional struggling bit of plant life peering from beneath the 
loose soil. Within the gully itself, sheltered by the wind, 
yellowish grass and sandbars line the sides and bottom, sometimes 
even obscuring the rock bottom. Other than this narrow gap, the 
mountains of dark rock block all view north and south eastwards.
   A strong, fire-hardened gate is to the east set within a 
sturdy wooden wall that bars passage in that direction.

High-Grass Lands About A Hillock~
   The ground underfoot here varies greatly as it stretches 
across untold miles of the far northern Ithilien. From broken 
puddles of muddy water to soggy soil, all punctured by the 
occasional outcropping of dark rock, there is little in the way 
to support easy travel across the heathland, yet alone 
habitation. A steady silence hangs in the air, the uninhabited 
bog set far from civilization, though the occasional rustling of 
grass betrays the presence of some life.

A Lowland Surrounded by Rolling Hillocks~
   These lowlands are as heavily grassed as their rising hillock 
highland neighbors. Bent grasses, small game trails, and other 
evidence of the verdancy of this area are in evidence year round. 
Golden year round save for spring the grasses and low lying brush 
rarely rise above the waist of a man and while they provide cover 
within their depths anything higher is evident, cast in 
silhouette against the gentle hills which rise in every 
direction.

Before the Looming Face of a Wind-Battered Butte~
   Pocked and pitted from countless years of wind and sand, a 
great hill of stone rises from the earth. Its slopes 
treacherously steep and made of some kind of dark, loose rock, 
boulders rest against the sides like silent guardians. One side 
of the hill loose partially collapsed, as though by a landslide 
that seems to have occurred some time ago. A ridge traces its 
way across the face of the hill towards the top, disappearing 
over the top. The Ephel Duath to the east shows some signs of 
diminishing to the northeast.

On a Jagged Ridge of Rock, Overlooking Low Hills~
   From atop this mound of jagged and broken rock stretches hills 
into the distance, the valleys hidden while the caps of them are 
shown to be only broken and unforgiving rock. The ridge itself 
is positioned at the height of one such hill, a weather-beaten 
and barely visible track leading from the ridge down into the 
valleys on either side. Bare rock and sand sit in dusty heaps, 
clustered together as if for safety from the coming of the winds. 
Eastwards the mountains begin to stretch away as they turn, with 
a rising striated slope edging towards a valley between the 
rising black cliffs.

Grasslands Surrounding a Fortified Tower~
   The immediate area is dotted with dozens of tree stumps, most 
little more than a few feet high. Near the center of the once 
woodland a ruined stone tower stands. Partially collapsed on one 
side it is completely open to the elements while the other half 
still stands defiant against them. Built around it, a camp has 
been erected. Timber from the surrounding area has been used to 
build a series of defenses from a tall palisade to heaped earth. 
Bones and half-devoured carcasses have been scattered throughout 
the area, creating a pungent smell of death and decay.

   Rough and jagged patches of stone interweave with stretches of 
broken sand, crumbling underfoot. The occasional half-buried 
root stretches across the loose shale to catch the unwary 
travelers passing. Rarely a tuft of greyish grass can be seen, 
struggling up from the sand and rock to lift towards the sky. 
More often, tufts of dry and yellowed grass linger amid the sharp 
stones, lifeless.

   Strewn along the dusty, loose soil is an assortment of 
palm-sized, sharp shale rock. Here and there a stunted, 
misshapen bush lurks amid the stones and dirt, though almost 
without fail the leaves have faded to a pale brown from lack of 
water and too much sun. A small stand of dead trees rests on the 
leeward side of the valley, the broken and snapped branches still 
reaching towards the sky. In the distance lie a set of low, 
rolling hills, each as barren as the tiny valley nestled between 
them. The Mountains of Shadow stretch off eastwards to the 
south.

The Slope of a Blasted Rise~
   As though torn by some great force in the distant past, a few 
large craters mar the surface of this slope. Razor-edged rock 
fragments lay in menacing formations, interwoven with hard-baked 
red and yellow clay. Further down the slope is striated bands of 
rock, the colors alternating every few feet. Twisted and 
malignant bushes shrug their limbs towards the baking heat of the 
sun in a few places, though they are all small and seemingly 
malnourished. 
   Above some clear effort has been made to striate the slope 
into fields of poor soil.

A Trail Through the Plains at the Edge of a Dismal Swamp~
   Shed bark, broken branches and season after season's lifeless 
leaves decorate the ground, coating the forest floor with a quiet 
carpet that is slowly decaying into the swampy soil. The smaller 
plants grow in tight clusters where they can find sunlight and 
spread fan like foliage in evergreen leaves. Tall and pyramidal 
in shape, the majority of the trees in this stretch of hill 
country grow close together, their widely spaced trunks provide 
ample freedom of movement where a natural trail has formed.

Following a Thin Trail Through Scrubby Plains~
   A thin winding path barely discerns itself from the 
surrounding landscape of scrubby plains as it runs east, west. 
Strongly rooted brush, rarely rising higher than the height of a 
man's shoulder dominate the flora and provide habitat for the 
animals that make this place their home. To the south, somewhat 
down slope, boggy lands can be barely distinguished where a small 
river runs into a much larger, fast flowing body of water.

Along a Forlorn Trail Through a Rocky Expanse~
   Save for the odd clumps of knee-high weeds and grass, or the 
bowed, gnarled tree, the land here is little more than large 
stretches of rock covered with fine layers of dirt, the whipping 
winds of the Dagorlad quickly blowing away this light covering of 
soil, snapping the sparse vegetation in to bowed postures of 
submission. Save for the occasional flight overhead of birds, 
there is little life to be observed here in the desolate plains 
of the Noman-lands.

A Trail Running Through Overgrown Grassy Fields~
   The broad fields of the Dagorlad, streching to the north, are 
wild and overgrown, tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in 
the wide, windswept plains untamed by the hands of men. The 
ground is hard underfoot, and interspersed with more than the 
occasional rock, great boulders piled up on small rises of land 
every so often. The area is devoid of wildlife, the ominous 
presence of the black, shard like mountains of the Ephel Duath to 
the south casting a dour atmosphere over the landscape.

of the Emyn Muil to the northwest, the barren wastelands of the

Mist Shrouded Woods Following a Wooded Ridge~
   Thick slabs of oozing disc-shaped fungus jut from the bark of 
one twisted trunk in a wood of otherwise unmarred straight 
slender trunks. An unpleasant scent is present near this one 
tree, adding to the oppressive atmosphere in the fog-darkened, 
heavy air beneath the tall evergreens. The marked silence of 
this wood is startling, for there is no rattling of small animals 
foraging, nor birdsong, nor even the sound of insects. There is 
only the wood, and the fog.

tempeture rather cool. The water, clearing slightly, is 
waist-deep in this section of the swamp. Upon its surface a 
blanket of weeds, lillies, reeds and other small plants spread. 
Luminous fungi and grey moss cluster at the bases of the giant 
cypress and willows trees that lurch out of the waters, reaching 
high into the sky only to have their branches trail down again. 
   To the west the swamp gives way the deep waters of the great 
River Anduin. The river frothy and turbulent as the water falls 
in a massive sheet from the height of the Emyn Muil, the peak of 
Tol Brandir rising high above. To the north, the cliffs of the 
Emyn Muil rise sharply, the mound of Amon Lhaw resting on their 
shoulders.

Dismal Swampland Below the Cliffs of the Emyn Muil~
   Dark brown water, rather cool in temprature, rises up 
waist-heigh in this section of the swamps. Upon the surface a 
blanket of weeds, lillies, reeds and other small plants stretch 
across the boundries of the swamp, set in varying shades of green

the giant cypress and willows trees that lurch out of the waters, 
reaching high into the sky only to have their branches trail down 
again. The swamp continues to the west and to the south, while 
to the west the ground rises slightly, giving way to a hazy 
woodland. 
   The waters of the swamp thin out to the north as the stalwart 
Emyn Muil, the mountain range that marks the northern border of 
the Ithilien, rises up from the landscape.

   Thick coarse rope and thick planks of aged lumber have been 
used to make a narrow foot bridge. There are gaps between each 
plank allowning the mist that rises from the bottom of the 
waterfall to pass through. Thick coarse rope, one on each side 
of the planks, run the length of the bridge, the far end of which 
vanishes into the roiling mist. The bridge sways in the wind and 
creaks noisily with each step taken on its planks.

Barren Trail Entering a Dismal Marshland~

disappears into a dismal marshland to the west, whilst to the 
distant east, the black mountains of the Ephel Duath rise. The

underfoot and the vegetation that does dare grow here, being but 
scrubby and wiry bushes. Though, some stretches of pale grass

Dusty Trail Through Barren Plains~
   Between a wide, flat plain and some barren hills, a hard 
packed, sun dried trail runs fairly straight to the east and 
west. The landscape here is damaged, bruised and beaten into low 
hilly growths and small valley drops, most barren though a few 
are covered in a coating of yellow grass. The occasional animal 
stalks through the area, though most common are circles of 
soaring birds high in the air, drifting on the winds that blow 
across the arid plain.

manages to grow being nothing but scrubby and wiry bushes. A few 
patches of pale grass, usually bowed by the wind, manage to

down from the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the 
mighty Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

Dusty, Dirt Trail Branches Off From an Old Road~
   On a dusty and barren, earth trail that snakes east and west 
following the junction of a broad desolate plain and some slowly 
rising, barren and rocky hills. The stark range of the Ephel 
Duath looms to the southeast of here, the land before the steep 
ascent of the mountains bumpy and rocky. The only life to be 
seen here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make their 
homes in the craggy lips and caves just barely visible on the 
surface of the dark mountains.

Northern Ithilien Forest~
   An intersection of sun baked, cracked surfaced trails, the 
wider one approaching from the south whilst a narrower trail 
continues to the west. Howling winds funnel down from the 
notches and gaps in the splintered peaks of the black mountains 
of Mordor that burst from the ground to the southeast, the 
terrain increasingly rocky and slopping upwards to meet them. 
Along with the wind comes the smell of something old, a chill 
presence and the occasional fine dust of soot.

Short Rolling Hills Emerging From a Desolate Marsh~
   Travel through these hills is far from easy; the landscape 
climbs and falls, yet uniformly grows more steep and stark as it 
heads east to the distant, towering, shard-like black mountains 
that mark the lands of Mordor. No human habitation is visible 
this close to dark border, nor to the west across the vast 
marshland that stretches out in that direction.

of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
plains of the Dagorlad northward, to the mighty, stark mountain

Grass Covered Rolling Hills~
   A thick growth of low lying bushes roams across the hills 
seperating Nortth Ithilien and the low lying plains to the north. 
To the east, the steep, thrusting, presence of the black moutains 
of the Ephel Duath is always felt. Small animal life darts 
amongst the clustered clumps of vegetation, as well as the 
occasional larger predator lurking far from the distant forest to 
the south, or the mountains eastward.

A Deathly Still Forest~
   The densely packed trunks of trees draw black vertical lines 
through a muted fog, their sparse top branches covered with long 
green needles. Red-brown grass covers the ground in thin patchy 
sections, growing knee high on an average man, round stalks 
fanning out at the top into cloudy arrays seeking in vain for 
sunlight. The air hangs heavy beneath the evergreens, as if the 
wood holds its breath. There is no sound of birdsong or any 
rustling of small animals about, nor even drone of insects.

Passing An Enormous, Dead Tree~
   Crooked, dark trees sprawl in all directions, the wet woodland 
seeming devoid of any life. Layers of dead leaves ring a tiny 
clearing amidst the woods, which is dominated by a huge, dead 
oak. The mammoth tree is so wide at the base that it would take 
at least a dozen Men with their arms spread wide to embrace it 
entierly. Its branches sway a little with breeze, producing a 
soft rattling sound. Other than this, the forest around is 
quiet.

searching for blood.

Climbing Hills In The North Ithilien Forest~
   Rising steadily as they move eastward, these hills are rugged 
in nature and march on far to the east. The putrid smell of 
stagnant water assaults the nostrils from the lowlands in the 
west, and the bleak forest continues up the hills becoming 
slightly more invigorated. Often the pests from the murky 
grounds to the west will come up the hill in search of blood 
amongst the healthier area of the forest.

A Hill Overlooking A Putrid Marsh~
   Here, the forest comes to meet its northern end as the hill 
begins to push down into the inky, black water below. The 
marshes beyond are putrid and foul-smelling. The trees even seem 
to begin to wilt as they approach the water. The leaves are 
curled and blackened; the limbs are twisted and gnarled. The 
foul stench seems to even corrupt the barren, rocky soil that is 
full of life the farther it is away from the inky waters to the 
north.

A Hill Overlooking A Pungent Pool of Inky Water~
   Off to the north of this tree-crowded hill, a spanning pool of 
jet black water stretches out into the distance. The rank stench 
of this diseased, stagnant water can be sniffed out with ease 
even from atop this hill. Many of the trees that are on the 
northern edge of the rocky mounds of the sloping hills are wilted 
or gnarled. To the east, the lands dip into a low, barren heath.

Overlooking the Marshes~
   An initially gentle slope gives way suddenly, dropping off 
downwards for several feet to the west. Below the incline, the 
sprawl of the Wetwang Marshes takes control of the landscape, it 
black murky pools and low vegetation spreading in that direction. 
Up here, the land is heavily wooded, tall trees overlooking the 
Marshes in a silent vigil.

Atop A Tall Hill Within The Mighty Forest Of Ithilien~
   Lying to the east of this hill is a valley filled with 
stagnant water. Emanating from the bleak forest below are swarms 
of insects that come to the brighter, healthier forest in search 
of blood. Here upon this rocky hill is a great stand of tall 
trees that loom over the landscape to the east and south as the 
hill climbs downward. 
   Standing in a clearing now being reclaimed by the forest is an 
ancient, dilapidated shack that struggles to retain its place 
amongst the trees whom invade its space in upon the hill.

A Valley Between The Sloping Hills Of North Ithilien~
   Soaked by putrid water, the ground about this part of the 
forest is full of decaying plants and buzzing insects. To either 
the east or west, sloping hills climb upward, leaving this area 
in a boggy valley filled with stagnant water. There is little 
life or movement here save that of the blood-sucking pests which 
hover just above the bleak, still surface of the water.

Wooded Hills Climbing Upward From The West~
   Climbing out of the boggy forest to the west, these hills 
gradually climb higher as they press eastward. The ground is 
rocky and the terrain uneven, but the forest is dense and lively 
despite. The sound of buzzing insects venturing from the bog is 
common, and the distant noise of animals lurking amongst the 
trees can often be heard.

Upon Rocky, Wooded Hills Of Northern Ithilien~
   Covering the rocky uneven terrain of this area are prominent 
trees that tower above the lowlands to the south. In all other 
directions, the forest continues along atop the high hills of 
North Ithilien. The sound of animals is frequent in this place, 
but the sounds of life diminish as one moves further northward, 
closer to where the hilly ground descends to meet the boggy 
marshes beyond.

Ithilien Hills Approaching A Heath Lowland~
   Sloping downward to the east, these hills march into a low 
heath. To the south, the hills more gradually lower as they turn 
into the forest below. Here, the rocky ground causes the forest 
to thin; despite the rocky ground, the forest still remains 
strong with tall trees that tower high overhead.

A Trail Cutting Between Hills In North Ithilien~
   Leading through the Ithilien hills, this trail through heath 
lowlands provides little substance upon which life may thrive. 
Although now nearly impossible to spot, the remnants of an 
ancient road cuts through this area, tall hills and dense forests 
looming upon either side of this ancient path.

Trail Leading Through A Valley~
   With hills towering upon either the north or south of this 
road, it faithfully cuts through this valley east and west, 
passing through the rather barren valley as it is shadowed by the 
forest that spans over the high, sloping hills of North Ithilien. 
Although it is difficult to see these days, the ruins of an 
ancient road can be seen yet.

   Moving through this valley, this road passes along broken and 
disturbed by fallen logs or large rocks. All about this trail is 
the high hills of North Ithilien. The hills are covered in dense 
forests which often shade the valley, and small gullies can be 
seen proceeding from the hills down to valley.

Upon Rocky Hills Far Into North Ithilien~
   Towering above the valley to the west, these hills are rugged 
and covered with a great many rock formations. The trees here 
still form a dense forest, but begin to give way as the hills 
climb eastward. From this hill, one may easily have a commanding 
view to either the north or south, allowing them to see a great 
distance along the road below.

Northern Ithilien Forest Meeting Some Barren Hills~
   The woods here grow lush and thick, predominantly untouched. 
There are layers of growth upon everything and the scent is the 
rich and earthy smell of forest life. Pale white mushrooms 
shaped like pancakes flourish upon fallen wood that slowly rots 
among the layers of leaves and needles from years past to feed 
the vines and grasses of undergrowth that are winning in their 
battle to usurp the loamy earth. Distant rustles of wind or 
wildlife filter between the trees.

Northern Ithilien Forest Rising To The West And North~
   The greyer trees give way to a copse of evergreens, rising 
tall and straight among their knotted and twisted brethren. 
Green and proud, the needled branches push forth, brushing arm to 
arm with their less stalwart cousins. From the foxy-brown carpet 
of dried needles underfoot, small seedlings push up, looking like 
tiny under-formed branches rising from the ground itself. The 
heady scent of the needles overwhelms all other odors from the 
surrounding forest, imbuing a sense of freshness and green.

North Ithilien Forest Meeting Sloping Hills~
   Climbing to the east and south are the rolling hills which 
dominate large portions of the Ithilien lands. To the north, a 
barren heath begins to form, and to the west and southwest, the 
dense forest covers the fertile soil of Ithilien. All about this 
area the presence of animals can be discerned, though it is 
difficult to capture more than a fleeting glimpse of the 
wildlife.

Northern Ithilien Forest~
   Tall and pyramidal in shape, the majority of the trees in this 
stretch of hill country grow close together, their widely spaced 
trunks provide ample freedom of movement. The undulating land 
can only be glimpsed in small snatches between the wide boughs. 
Arboreal animal life chitters and dances above the forest floor 
where an aromatic, sound-dampening, deep carpet of brown needles 
covers the ground.

Hills Overlooking A Heath~
   To the north of here, the hills begin a gradual descent into a 
heath lowland. In all other directions, the hills continue to 
roll over the lands of Ithilien, covered in strong, dense 
forests. The thick canopy above dims the light provided by the 
sun during the daytime, and the smaller flora struggles for light 
as the tall trees cast shadows over all this area of the rolling 
hills.

Upon The Rolling Hills Of North Ithilien~
   Rolling over the lands of northern Ithilien, these hills climb 
and dip as they move off in all directions. The land here is 
uneven and covered by deep forests that make it difficult to 
maneuver about freely. A thicky canopy above shades the ground 
of the hills and the dense vegetation obscures the location of 
the nearby wildlife that is easily heard.

   The climbing hills gradually move upward as they travel to the 
east. As the terrain climbs, it becomes more rocky and uneven. 
The dense vegetation of the forest lessens as the hills steadily 
grow in height. The terrain here is difficult to cross, but may 
be passed over in due time if one is diligent of the uneven 
ground.
