The Foyer of a Loud, Busy Shelter~
   The door that leads into the building from the fields is 
constantly opening and closing, though it is sometimes left open 
by the children dashing from the back of the shelter to the 
outdoors. Nearly always bustling with activity, this entrance 
foyer is rarely silent, and more often than not sees dirt and 
grass tracked inside. A single desk has been placed in the 
center of the room, while a few benches provide a place to sit 
and wait. Doors open up in all directions: outdoors, to the 
north; into a storage area, to the south; and into the shelter 
itself to the east and west. #6OOC: To donate to the shelter, 
hold ONLY your intended donation in your hands and type DONATE

   Small but neat, this storage area holds the materials required

A Path Leading to the Shelter~
   The expanse of the fields are visible immediately north, 
though a fence surrounds this large yard to enclose it on the 
eastern and western sides. To the south, a door opens into the 
shelter itself, constantly opening and closing. Sounds of 
activity are audible from all around, as children play in the 
area and adults supervise from nearby.

A Path Around the Lake~
   On the edge of a modestly-sized lake, the path is grassy in 
places and worn as a path winds around the lake. It continues 
north and south, bordering the large body of water that's set to 
the east. Lamps and lanterns have been strategically placed to 
give light to the area at all times, and while wardens patrol the 
area, it is mostly silent and peaceful but for the sounds of 
animals and the gentle lapping of the lake at the shores. Just 
west of here, the expanse of the fields opens up as far as can be 
seen.

A Large Valley Between Ordinary Land~
   While the land on either side of this large valley is of usual 
height, it is solely this area here that has sunken down below 
the average. Remnants of where an old creek-bed used to be is 
the focus of the valley, but it seems that, with the building of 
the dam, it has dried up. It seems that most of the dirt and 
earth for the dam's creation, as well, has been stolen from this 
area, leaving a serious, deep indention in the land. The grass 
here is high, rising to the average man's waist.

A Path Around the Lake~
   This area, while still holding with the wooded atmosphere, is 
cleared of underbrush and other such torments that would be 
obstacles to one on a leisurely walk through the woods. The 
trees are of a scattered variety, varying between oak and beech 
as they hug the lakeshore. The shore itself is rather steep and, 
rather than a slope, it seems to have a steep, sudden half of 
land. A well-defined path leads about the edge of the water, 
heading east and west.

A Path Around the Lake~
   Here at the northeast corner of the lake, it seems that this 
area is rather frequently visited: the grass, when present, is 
frequently trampled from the sitting forms of visitors and from 
boots, oftentimes even left-over piles of ash from camp-fires 
leaving their dark mark atop the ground. This corner here is 
something of an anomaly as the woods have made a small clearing, 
trees west and trees south, but this area only grassy and clear.

A Path Around the Lake~
   While the shore of the lake is steep and rather drop-off-ish 
in other areas, it has been tamed and made into an acceptable 
wading ground here. The water slopes down into the depths, 
steadily growing deeper from where it laps at the eastern shore, 
making it an excellent swimming ground for those who wish to 
participate in such. Small banks of green weeds grow on either 
side of this beach, but it seems that, in the summer, the 
make-shift beach is kept relatively free of even those.

A Path Around the Lake~
   This area here is still, perhaps, the most heavily wooded of 
all of the land directly surrounding the lake, the trees growing 
close together with their trunks guarded by underbrush and the 
rare rosebush. While traveling into those parts would be a 
rather thorny affair, the path that leads through them is kept 
almost religiously free of such menaces, and a small, circular 
clearing is here. It is almost room-esque with the tightness of 
the plant life, and a circle of lover's-benches have been ringed 
into the clearing, the path jutting through its middle.

A Path Around the Lake~
   The area here was, perhaps, a high hill that has been steadily 
mediated by the ages. It is no longer of towering height, but it 
does rise some several feet above the surrounding land, and 
offers perhaps the best view of the lake as it stretches between 
the shores. On clear days, one standing atop the high, 
psuedo-cliff where the hill meets the lake would be able to see 
for quite a distance around. The trees themselves seem to 
cluster around the base of the hill rather than rising up onto 
the top, where the path cuts cleanly through the median between 
top of the cliff and the trees.

A Path Around the Lake~
   As the path weaves from the north and continues towards the 
east, the borders are decisively marked by healthy grasses, 
though the trail itself primarily consists of trampled grasses 
and dirt. People are often seen passing along the well-lit area, 
wardens patrolling it every so often as the occasional creature 
scampers underfoot. Small benches have been set around, and tiny 
streams extend from the lake itself.

Within a Lake~
   Of moderate size, the waters of this lake lap lightly at the 
shores to all sides, forming an odd shape where it meets the land 
around it. Small ripples often disturb the surface as small fish 
and larger ones swim along it. In some places, the water is 
rather shallow, while in others, it is considerably deeper, 
extending far over the average person's head should their feet 
touch the rocky bottom.

An Underground Pier~
   The sound of waves lapping at the pier is almost hypnotic, 
each rush of the tide bringing in another set of them and thus, a 
musical sound. Above, a heavy layer of wood provides a roof to 
this area, and seemingly serves as a floor to some large 
building, as stairs lead up into it, ending at a heavy trapdoor 
with a solid lock. Despite the covering of wood, it provides 
little shelter from the elements, the weather given clear course 
through the open sides. Narrow and rickety, the pier offers only 
one point at which to tie off a boat, and little traffic is seen, 
making it quiet more often than not.

penetrates the walls of this cramped room despite the thickness

Lord Astirian whom you are pledged to serve in his Wardenry is a powerful and influential man who is known to have the ear of the Steward himself. The carriage turns slightly northwestward for a moment as it passes a village surrounding a two-story inn. The driver calls down to you that it is Wardog's Green you are passing, the center of most social and economic activity in Pelennor. The road soon turns due north once again and the village drops behind to the southeast.

blocking travel along the Lond north and south, and sturdy 
buildings on either side east and west, creating a boxed effect. 
Both gates are well-reinforced with iron, particularly the 
northern one. The flanking buildings are constructed of logs, 
and heavy doors are set into the north end of each. Between the 
upper levels of the flanking buildings there is a covered wooden 
walkway a bridge of sorts which overlooks this section of road

Trail to the Cabin~
   Surrounded by thick trunks of the many birch trees in this 
copse, a short trail leads from a slight incline to the east to a 
newly constructed cabin to the west. Though the frame of the 
cabin blocks easy access further, a more formidable barrier is a 
sheer drop on either side which falls away down towards the 
Pelennor Fields. This small clearing has been carefully prepared 
so that the ground approaching the pine door of the cabin is 
smooth and devoid of roots or brush. During most seasons 
songbirds can be heard all around and the scent of forest flowers 
wafts from the thicker forest climbing to the east blocking out 
the sunrise.

A Cabin Kitchen~
   Homely and warm are two ways to describe this kitchen. In the 
eastern corner of the room can be seen an iron brazier built 
right beside the wall, a warm glow coming from it as it heats the 
room when lit. The room is spacious and has a table situated in 
the middle of the room, with the stove being to the northern most 
wall. Wooden shelves have been built into the eastern wall, on 
either side of a window overlooking a small clearing before the 
thick trees of the copse rise out of sight and block out much of 
the light. A curtain separates this room from one to the west. 
A pine door leads out to the clearing.

A Cozy, Square Room~
   This cozy, warm square room is large in size with a high 
ceiling. The walls consist of a fine wooden log finish save for 
the stonework around the freshly built-in fireplace, a construct 
of smooth river rocks bound into a small arch by mortar. In the 
eastern wall a partition allows access into a small kitchen area. 
Generously sized windows have been set into the western log wall, 
providing light during the afternoons and also a beautiful view 
of the Pelennor and beyond, to Mindolluin. Looking out, it is 
clear that this cabin stretches over a drop, as the trees dips 
away sharply below. A small stairwell leads up into the loft.

to allow light into the room and a glorious view of the expanse 
of the fields, as well as the Mindolluin in its magnificence. 
During clear sunsets, this room basks in orange and rosy gold. A 
stairwell leads down to a square room.

Moderately-sized, the inside of this tent measures about fifteen

connected by a shorter ridge pole form the frame of this tent, 
supporting the canvas. The ends of the tent are half-conical in shape 
judging by the size, this tent could easily sleep four. In one side of 
the tent is a five foot-high, three-foot wide door with two flaps that

Inside a Huge Pavilion Tent~
Sturdy black walls of carefully joined bolts of heavy cotton held 
aloft by stained brown wooden poles form more than adequate shelter 
from outside weathers. Brass lanterns, polished until they reflect 
their own light, shed warm illumination throughout the tent as 
they sway slightly from the crossties. The ground is covered by 
sturdy woven rugs of twisted cloths of black and silver wool. On 
one end, a rectangular opening leads outside. A large, colorful 
tapestry has been hung over the opening to protect the 
inhabitants, intricate work depicting Gondorian Soldiers marching 
in rank and file behind the flag of Gondor and a banner bearing a 
black shield before a silvery grey moon.

The Bountiful Fields of Pelennor~
   These lands are the breadbasket of Gondor, the ample crop that 
is raised here on these lands nigh to constantly being drawn from 
these lands and carried off towards the White Mountain, to Minas 
Tirith, by the carts and wagons by the farmers and the hunters 
who live in work in this portion of Gondor's domain.

A Dense Section of the Great Birch Wood~
   This dense stand of woods is filled with many strong birch 
trees. Each of the trees is covered with smooth, grey bark. 
Higher up the trees, a thick covering of leaves forms a canopy 
that blots out the majority of the sun's light, leaving this area 
well-shaded, causing the saplings here to struggle.

arrow, across the westernmost land, continuing to trace the line

earth loom, dark against the summer grass. The marks of many

At a Corner in the Rammas Echor~
   To the north, the woodlands of Anorien rise up, creating a 
shady area off in the distance, the sound of animals easily able 
to be heard coming from that area. To the south and west, the 
white stone wall known as Rammas Echor rises up, an impenetrable 
barrier between Anorien and the Pelennor Fields. 
   Massive granite blocks stand solidly in a line against the 
fresh excavations. which has been dug into the earth. Above, on 
either side of the channel, the sides are being made into steep 
slopes. The channel continues to gouge eastwards.

At a Bend in the Rammas Echor~
   To the south and to the west, the formidable stone wall known 
as the Rammas Echor can be seen dominating the landscape of 
Anorien. At its feet, a heavy shade lies, and the life beneath 
the wall is little. To the north and east, the fields of Anorien 
open up, life being more evident in those areas.

A Garden Path to a Round Green Door~
   A neatly-cobbled path runs through flower beds here, from a 
wooden split-rail fence to a round, moss-green-painted door with 
a brass handle in the center. The door is about five feet high 
and is set in a wall made of warm rust-colored bricks,chinked 
with moss and ivy, which wraps around the southwest corner of a 
low, grassy hill. A pair of small round windows flanks the door, 
a window ledge under each. A variety of plants grow in profusion 
here, spilling from gardens across the hill, while loose vines of 
ivy curl over the stones of the path. The path branches to the 
west, where more gardens can be seen before it curves around the 
side of the hill.

A Cozy Sitting-Room~
   Paneled with birchwood varnished a warm hazelnut-brown, this 
room is comfortable and pleasant. The walls curve gently into an 
oblong circle, avoiding harsh corners, and are spacious if not 
very tall. The ceiling has arching rafters, reaching seven feet 
in the middle of the room where a round wooden chandelier 
supplies a yellow candlelight glow, and coming down to only five 
feet at the room's corners. The floor is polished hardwood 
covered with thick, plain moss-green carpeting that extends 
around much of the room. A fireplace of neatly mortared stone is 
on the east wall, a chimney rising out of the roof. A round 
window is perfectly sized and centered in the south wall, flanked 
by moss-green tie-back curtains.

   This kitchen is neatly organized with wide walkways, offering 
plenty of room for a chef to maneuver. A large table takes up 
the center of the room, with other racks and shelves of 
implements attached to the walls. The north and east walls are 
made of cool grey stone and white plaster, absorbing heat thrown 
by the ovens. The west wall is of birchwood boards varnished a 
hazelnut-brown and has a fireplace of neatly mortared stone at 
its center, a chimney rising up the wall through the roof. A 
round window is perfectly sized and centered in the south wall,

An Expansive Root-Cellar~
   Though low, this room is broad and expansive, extending under 
all the rooms above. The air is chill and somewhat damp, as 
befits this underground chamber. The walls are packed earth and 
bedrock, sealed with a thick coating of whitewash and shored with 
hewn timbers. The space is six feet high from end to end, the 
ceiling above formed by the joists and hardwood planking of the 
floor above. The floor is smoothed and polished natural bedrock, 
marred and scratched by the dragging of heavy items. Plain 
wooden shelving is attached to the wall joists, while other items 
are stacked about.

walls curve around to meet in the back, bulging outward as well, 
giving the room a burrow-like feel despite the yellow-painted

   An extension of the burrow, this greenhouse is walled and 
roofed in wood to the point where it extends beyond the slope of 
the hill, at which point glass panes allow sunshine in from the 
south and west as well as above. The air here is moist and 
warmer than elsewhere in the dwelling, despite its proximity to 
the outside. Long, narrow tables run the length of the room and 
are generously supplied with greenhouse plants. A sturdy, 
cross-barred door set in the north wall allows access to the barn 
beyond.

Garden Beds at the Foot of a Hill~
   A cobblestone path winds east to north here around the base of 
a grassy hill which rises sharply to the northeast. Neat garden 
beds are laid out here on either side of the path, each bed 
following the natural contours of the ground rather than 
demarcating straight lines. The lush scent of galenas and other 
herbs rises up from them, giving the gardens a sweet air. A wall 
of warm, rust-colored bricks built into the hillside ends just 
after coming in from the east, giving way to window glass 
supported by dark-stained wood timbers. The panes of thick 
translucent glass bend around with the curvature of the hillside, 
seeming nearly part of the hill itself.

Pasture Outside a Grass-Roofed Building~
   This grassy sward lies nestled between a pair of gentle hills, 
forming a natural yard. A long, low wooden building is built 
into the eastern one, grass and other plants spilling from the 
hill to crown the roof. Dirt cart-tracks lead from the door to 
the southern gate of a split-rail fence, which curves around to 
undulate along the base of the western hill and define the yard 
as it runs northward. The ground has a generally trampled look 
near the building, but tall grasses wave and a profusion of 
plants have sprung up along the fence-line and elsewhere.

Field Girdled by a Split-Rail Fence~
   A wooden split-rail fence rings in this furrowed field on 
three sides, continuing around either side of a large but 
low-lying hill to the south. Gentle hills cradle the field on 
all sides, sheltering it from the worst of the wind and weather. 
The soil appears abundantly fertile, judging from the grass and 
other plants that nudge their way onto even the most freshly 
plowed or weeded places.

from the center of the room. The walls are stained with a 
mid-green hue to the north and south and gold on the western 
facing wall which also contains a sturdy door. This room is 
well-made, with few sounds finding their way in. A subtle scent 
of woodlands hangs in the air.

   A dirt trail runs across the forest, leading to a log cabin in 
a clearing on the southwest part of the copse. The trail appears 
to be well-worn, marked with numerous shoe prints leading to and 
from the cabin. It has been littered with twigs and branches 
which, no doubt, have broken off from the nearby yew trees that 
surround the path from either side. 
   A second trail leads eastwards.

the other side. A door has been set to the northern wall a bit 
to the west from the protrusion. On both sides of a pine door 
leading outside there is a window, allowing sight into the 
clearing in which the cabin is situated, as well as the majestic 
yew trees surrounding it. In the eastern wall separating the 
room from the one to the east is a thin door.

stone fireplace has been built into the northern wall, causing a 
bump to the wall of the room beyond and giving warmth to the room 
when lit.

   Three relatively large windows, tessellated by thin wooden 
bars, have been set on the northern, eastern and western side of 
the room, one on each wall, creating an illusion of a room more 
vast than it really is. The windows also offer a view to the 
dense forest surrounding the cabin. An iron brazier has been set 
to both ends of the room, glowing light and warmth when lit to 
keep out the cold that easily sneaks in through the large 
windows. Under a loft above, a thin door leads to the cabin's 
kitchen. A small stairwell descends from the loft above.

serves as a passage from the stairwell to a room behind a smooth, 
finely built log wall, the only disturbance in its wooden lines

A Small Yard Amidst an Orchard~
   This small, well-tended yard is situated in the middle of this 
hilltop orchard, allowing it a view not only of the whole orchard 
but the rest of the farm itself. The yard is enclosed by a 
simple, low fence, with a gap to the east leading to the orchard 
proper. A path leads through the yard, from that gap across to 
the very door of the Groundskeeper's Cottage. The base of the 
cottage is lined with large river rocks, while the walls 
themselves are build of solid pinewood, and the roof is freshly 
thatched. Large, thick shutters are designed to protect the 
windows in harsh weather, and the door to the cottage itself is 
thick and stout. A well sits to near to the cottage, lined with 
the same rock making up that structure's base.

   This room is fairly large, taking up most of the cottage 
itself, except for the back, where a small door leads off into a 
bedroom. The wooden planks of the floors have been covered with 
simple wool rugs to the rear near the bedroom door, separating it 
into a living area of sorts, with a fireplace, table, and other 
furniture necessary for one to relax after a day's hard work. 
The front floor of the cottage, meanwhile, is left bare, reserved 
for shelves of supplies, racks of gardening tools, and the like, 
declaring this the working space for Thornhill Farm's 
Groundskeeper. In one corner, a trapdoor opens up to reveal 
stone steps leading down into a cellar.

A River-rock-lined Cellar~
   This small cellar is obviously meant to hold storage, with 
shelves lining the wall. It has been dug deep enough for the 
average man to have just enough head space to stand normally, 
though the beams running the length of the cottage floor above 
means that any travel needs to be done hunched over. The walls 
and floors of the cellar are lined securely with river rock, and 
packed thoroughly with clay and sand to prevent moisture and 
rainwater from getting inside.

A Cozy Bedroom With an Orchard View~
   This bedroom is small; best suited to one or two people at 
most. It has been ingeniously designed to be kept warm in winter 
by the bricks from the fireplace in the cottage's main room, so 
that it does not need its own fireplace. Warm wool rugs line the 
floor, while thick stout shutters seal off the windows during 
harsh weather. When they are open, they give the occupants of 
this room an amazing view of the orchard that the cottage sits in 
the middle of, as well as the view of the Pelennor Fields beyond, 
since the orchard itself is situated atop a small hill.

   This roofed area is open to the west, with walls of wooden

small cart, but not quite large enough for a wagon. It allows 
for maximum versatility while providing some protection from the 
elements as the smith works.

and in wet weather can be very muddy. Around the edges of the

while a gate to the west opens to the front yard of the house.

A Workroom~
   Uniform blocks of white stone have been used to construct the 
walls of this room that clearly serves as a workshop. Unstained 
wood beams form the ceiling which meets well above the head of a 
man. Several windows are placed very high near the ceiling, 
leaving plenty of room along the walls for cabinets while still 
admitting light and fresh air. Racks on the walls display 
various tools, for working with metal or stone.

A Storage Room~
   More white stone was used to make this room, although the 
ceiling is not as high as the rest of the house. The room is 
small, but the ample racks and shelves that nearly fill the room 
yield a great deal of storage. A single door to the west leads 
back into the main house.

A Modest Barracks~
   Walls of wood make up this moderate sized room built onto the 
original stone cabin. Set on the far side of the house from the 
working areas, it is actually quiet enough for sleeping and 
relaxing. Several windows let in ample light and fresh air. A 
single door to the south leads into the main room of the house.

An Assembly Chamber~
   This square vaulted room is constructed of the same gleaming 
white carefully-worked stone as the Lord's Hall. The ceiling 
curves to a central point into which is set a circular ornate 
carving depicting perfectly worked leaves, intertwining sheaves 
of corn, grapes, and other fruits of the land. Four arching 
stone ribs rise, one from each corner, to merge into the carving. 
Small rectangular windows are set high in the walls, allowing 
long shafts of light into the room, whilst still preserving 
privacy. The eastern wall, directly opposite the door, is 
dominated by a striking carving of a sword, point upraised, its 
clearly carved outlines shining white against an intricately 
decorated seven-pointed star, picked out in fine detail in 
high-polished marble. The floor here is, again, of superbly 
finished black stone slabs, highly polished, and reflecting 
light. Wall lamps, evenly set, shed light during the night. A 
large table is set in the centre of the room. 
   An iron-banded door is set into the northern wall, secured 
with a heavy bolt. The western wall offers access to the Meeting 
Hall through a thick oaken door.

A Yard Before Riverwatch House~
   A low fence surrounds this packed earth yard. Meadows spread 
out to the east, and the township of Milton is visible between 
the orchard trees to the north. To the west is a sizeable cabin 
made from thick logs, while to the south a cobblestone path leads 
out through the gate into a large garden. Two hooded lanterns 
are attached to sconces on either side of the cabins main door, 
providing dim illumination at night.

A Sizeable Living Room~
   A long table stands in the centre of the smooth, polished 
floor of this well-appointed living room. Chairs are dotted 
about the room, with a group of them around the wide flagstone 
hearth and fireplace set into the southern wall. There is a 
heavily-shuttered window to either side of the eastern doorway, 
overlooking the yard and countryside beyond. A small table 
stands next to the northern window with a cupboard placed against 
the wall just beyond it. The room opens out into a corridor to 
the north, while a curtained archway well off to the side of the 
fireplace leads into the kitchen to the south. There is a sturdy 
door set into the western wall, and to one side of it hangs a 
painting of the Pelennor Fields and Minas Tirith. At night, the 
room is kept lit by lamps set in wall sconces.

A Large, Well-Kept Garden~
   A cobblestone path runs straight from the northern edge of 
this garden, through the abundant plant life and lush grass, 
circles around the well in the centre then splits, half continues 
on to the western door, while a separate branch travels down 
towards the south. Various bushes are scattered about the 
garden, mingled with well-kept flower beds, large herb patches 
and young trees. There is a very gentle incline, going downwards 
to the south. A four foot high dry stone wall surrounds the 
garden, disappearing towards the southeast and returning from the 
southwest, eventually curving around to adjoin the cabin's 
southern wall.

   The floor in this kitchen is made of polished flagstone, cut 
smoothly to adjoin with the wooden floor of the living room to 
the north. A good stove stands near the fireplace by the 
northern wall, while a workbench runs along most of the length of 
the eastern wall, with a wide, heavily-shuttered window just 
above it, overlooking the garden, which can be accessed by the 
sturdy door in the south-eastern corner of the room. Straight 
across from the door, an open archway leads into a workroom to 
the west while a further door is set in the centre of the 
southern wall. Various containers stand by the western wall. A 
round table dominates the centre of the room, leaving enough just 
room to move around unhindered.

wall. There is a single wide window with heavy shutters in the

nearby Anorien forests this spacious barn has one window facing

tall it doesn't match the height of the thatch roof, supported by 
wide, angled beams.

A Climbing Path in the Pelennor~
   This gently climbing path ascends a hill that stretches 
eastwards but ends quite shortly westwards, the view towards the 
mountains dramatic as the farms and fields fall below. The grass 
and low shrubs are wind-swept as they cling to the hill, with a 
few hardy hawthorns clinging on. While the gentle slope 
eastwards rounds out of sight, the westward edge of the hummock 
falls away sharply, barring access above from the northwest. 
Below, the trail meets the farmlands and a path towards Wardogs. 
Above, a fence can be made out at the crescent.

   Oak beams stretch across this high-roofed warehouse, 
comprising a simple open space surrounded with pale, 
fresh-smelling pine slats. Everything about this large area 
suggests haste, including the hard dirt floor. Crates and high, 
broad shelving stretch out from the western wide doors in rows 
for storage, with soldiers of Great House Hurin busy with ledgers 
or with the laboring tasks barked out by officers. This is a 
military storage facility and access is only allowed as far as a 
small desk set just inside the entrance.

A Steep Foottrail Ascending into the Mountain~
   At a steep incline, this foot trail is just wide enough for 
two people to walk safely side by side. The brush clinging to 
the sides of the paths seems to be less healthy than the pastures 
of the valley below. The eastern side of the trail ends with a 
sharp descent to the valley beneath it, while the western side 
rises up to the impassable mountain. There are chips and cracks 
out of the rockface that look to have been made by men in places, 
but overall, it seems to be either very old and worn down or 
natural in occurance.

trail~
   The trail looks to be uneven and rocky, with dirt mounded in

erosion has worn much of that away.

   These chips seem to be at about shoulder level on an average

A Steep Foottrail Climbing the Mountain~
   This foot trail continues to rise above the plains of the 
Pelennor as it climbs up Mindolluin. It is just barely wide 
enough to allow for two average sized men to walk side by side. 
Less plants seem to grow here and they seem to hide in the cracks 
along the mountain. The eastern side of the trail ends with a 
sharp descent to the valley far beneath it, while the western 
side rises up to the curves of the impassable mountain. A deep 
mark has been made into the side of Mindolluin here.

A Steep Foottrail Climbing the Mountain~
   This part of the path is more narrow as it continues to climb 
the mountain. There is a greater amount of dirt and plants which 
seem to be growing decently well as they cling to the crevices 
and ruts in the trail. Off to eastern side of the path, a steep 
cliff falls down to the pastures of the Pelennor below. The rock 
face on the western side of the trail has a variety of mostly 
worn off sigils. A large tower looms in the horizon of this foot 
trail. A stable can been seen to the north as this footpath 
seems to connect with a larger one at the front of the stable.

A Short Corridor~
   Torches line the grey-white walls of this short corridor, 
smaller stones of comparable color and texture cobble the floor. 
This corridor is sparsely furnished, a single window to the north 
looking out through the outer wall of the bastion, afforded by 
the vantage point held atop the hill, and into the Pelennor 
beyond. The Lond Forodren Annui, frequently baring carts and 
merchants, snaking its north-westerly course through the fields 
towards the gates Rammas Echor can be seen in the distance. 
   Delicious smells linger in this corridor from the kitchen to 
the west. A winding staircase ascends to the upper floor, set in 
an alcove on the eastern side.

   Sparsely furnished, this office is circular in shape and made

the bastion towards the Lond Forodren Annui in the distance. 
During the darker hours, the office is lit by a pair of lanterns 
attached to the wall. The ceiling of the room arches into the 
middle, sturdy balks of wood positioned to support the roof 
overhead.

   Grey-white stone walls surround the confines of this stable as

floor of this barn-like structure although it stops near the 
north wall where a sturdy wooden door has been set that leads 
into the training area. A large, heavy, double wooden door leads 
off to the south and out onto the trail. 
   The sounds of swords clashing, grunts and shouts can be heard 
during the day and into the night through the doors to the north.

A Small Holding Cell~
   This small cell is cold, damp, and uninviting. The ceiling is 
high enough for a man to stand upright and it is large enough to 
hold a bed or two at most. An oil lamp is ensconced securely in 
the wall, providing some dim light for the chamber. Moisture 
from above dampens the rock that makes up the walls and ceiling. 
Iron shackles are bolted to one wall and straw partially covers 
the stone floor. An iron bound door to the south is the only 
exit out of this room.

A Small Holding Cell~
   This small cell is cold, damp, and uninviting. The ceiling is 
high enough for a man to stand upright and it is large enough to 
hold a bed or two at most. An oil lamp is ensconced securely in 
the wall, providing some dim light for the chamber. Moisture 
from above dampens the rock that makes up the walls and ceiling. 
Iron shackles are bolted to one wall and straw partially covers 
the stone floor. An iron bound door to the east is the only exit 
out of this room.

A Dirt Path Leading to a Large Gate~
   Wending its way from Lond Forodren Annui, this smaller road 
leads through fields and between hills towards a large military 
looking building situated on a hill and surrounded by a high 
wall. Above the gate to the north-west, a high tower of 
grey-white stone can be seen rising into the sky, a series of 
crenelations crowning the top. The gate itself is large, heavy, 
made of oak and spans the entirety of the road. Spikes adorn the 
top of the gate, keeping guard against any foolish enough to try 
and climb over. The gate is fixed to the walls by four massive, 
metal hinges and is opened inwards with the aide of two large 
iron rings.

Northern Crenelations of the Pelennor Bastion~
   A spectacular view of the Pelennor fields can be seen from the 
top of this crenelated roof. To the north, one can just about 
see the Rammas Echor and the road leading to the gate. A little 
to the north-east is Wardogs Green and the Lond Forodren-Annui. 
To the west, Mindolluin and the White Mountains stretch skywards, 
their white peaks looking down forebodingly upon the fields 
below. The rooftop is lit by two large braziers and is 
frequented by archers on duty at all times of the day and night. 
   The rooftop battlements continue to the south.

Pelennor Bastion Warehouse~
   Constructed of the same grey-white stone found elsewhere about 
the bastion, this large warehouse is quite roomy. Utilitarian in 
design and decor, this single room building has plenty of open 
space, allowing for a variety of storage bins, racks and cabinets 
to be placed here. A wide gap down the middle allows wagons to 
enter if need be. Several lanterns have been spaced along the 
walls, providing ample light. 
   A wide double-door provides access back to the stables.

A Spacious Kitchen Area~
   Grey-white stone blocks line the walls and floor of this 
kitchen. The air in this room retains a hot temperature the 
whole year around, and raises to stifling during the summer 
months, from the many stoves and hearths available to the 
bastion's cooks. Poor ventilation is provided through two 
windows, one in the north outer wall looking out towards the 
Pelennor and one in the western wall, the latter providing a view 
of a small gap between the back of the warehouse and the outer 
wall. 
   A trapdoor set in one corner of the room leads down to a cool 
larder, the only other exit is back through the eastern door.

A Small, Somber Cemetery~
   A narrow, grey-white stone flagged path leads the way into 
this well-kept cemetery and continues through the middle towards 
the western outer wall of the bastion. Soft, green grass grows 
well here, but is kept short and well maintained. It is quite a 
small graveyard, large enough to accommodate perhaps ten graves. 
   To the south the southern outer wall continues in from the 
east and curves round northwards. Eastwards leads back to the

A Compact Armory~
   Weapon racks, armor stands, crates and shelving packed full of 
various implements of war can be found within this armory. The 
same grey-white stones that make the rest of the bastion cover 
the floor and make the walls. Torches, ensconced at equal 
intervals, line the walls creating a soft light that shines off 
metal and casts a dull luster to oiled leather. A pair of 
windows overlook the Marshal Yard to the south. 
   A door in the northern wall leads back to the first floor

Southern Crenelations of the Pelennor Bastion~
   The rooftop continues here and stops a short way to the south. 
Large crenelations provide cover for the archers that frequent 
this area at all times of the day and night. A spectacular view 
of the city of Minas Tirith can be seen to the south-west. Its 
many tiers climbing the great height of Mount Mindolluin, though 
they are miniature in comparison to the mountain itself. 
Southwards can be see the Harlond docks and the many boats that 
are moored there. Eastwards lies the Lond Forodren-Annui and 
further, the white stones of fallen Osgiliath and the river 
Anduin on which she sits. 
   Leaning over the edge of the Crenelations would allow one to 
view the Marshal Yard below, and the cell block and cemetery 
further to the west.

A Tall, Broad Tunnel~
   Cut into the rock of the mountain, this tunnel is wide and 
tall. The ceiling is high enough to accommodate even a mounted 
rider, and broad enough for a wagon to pass comfortably through. 
For the most part, the stone is solid and basically smooth, 
although the occasional crack or fissure may be seen. Heavy 
timbers have been used to support the ceiling, spaced evenly 
along the length of the tunnel. 
   A spot of light can be seen far along the tunnel to the west. 
To the east, the corridor's end has been disguised by thick 
undergrowth.

A Wide, Partially Exposed Tunnel~
   This wide tunnel has been cut into the living stone of the 
mountain. Wide, with a high ceiling, it runs a straight course 
from east to west. The rock is mostly smooth, except for a 
portion where the tunnel ends to the west, where some upheaval 
has caused a fair sized portion of the stone to fall away. 
Exposed to the outdoors, the floor has been weathered here and is 
a bit bumpy. A rivulet runs along the shattered stone beside the 
tunnel, burbling its way downwards to the west. 
   An opening leads westwards to the outdoors, while the tunnel 
continues into the mountain to the east.

A Walled-In Corner of the Valley~
   The contours of the mountains surrounding this valley have 
created a wide area here, which has been cornered in by a high 
stone wall. The land inside is mostly flat, rising sharply at 
its edges in a daunting, rocky slope. Thick thorns and brambles, 
peppered with small trees and bushes dominate the flora, with 
more trees finding a home beside a brook that runs parallel to 
the southern wall. The brook tumbles down the mountainside from 
the east, splashing over a small portion of the mountain that has 
fallen into rubble. Continuing westward, the stream heads off 
around large stones. A freshly-lain wide shingled path runs from 
the mouth of a tunnel to the east, following beside the brook for 
a ways before turning toward the ruins of a building near the 
northern slope of the valley. 
   Beside the scree of the rock slide to the east opens a wide 
tunnel, delving into the mountain.

Freshly Laid Path Before a Ruined Building~
   This once must have been an open meadow, but now has been 
reclaimed by thorns, brambles, low shrubs, and small trees. A 
freshly-laid path has been laid through here, leading to a 
building just north of here that is now only ruins. Several rose 
bushes have found a home amidst the brush here, helping to bar 
the way to the rest of the grounds, which continue around the 
structure on both sides. 
   The ruins lie to the north, while the wide, shingled path 
leads southwards.

Amidst the Ruins of a Building~
   Almost completely destroyed, what remains of this structure 
suggest that it suffered a devastating fire at some point. A few 
of the stones that make up what remains of a foundation bear 
scorch marks, although even this is largely lost to years of 
weathering and overgrowth. The overall shape of the ruins 
suggest a round layout, with small heaps and piles of cut stones 
leaving few other hints about the building that once stood here. 
Set in the middle of the ruins is an arched stone rectangular 
pillar, with a bronze doorway set into a marbled doorframe on the 
western side. 
   A widened freshly-lain path leads to the south.

An Extensive Underground Repository~
   Some trick of the stone this repository is carved from keeps 
the area incredibly dry and the temperature remarkably even 
year-round. Several long rooms have been dug, connected to a 
small central hub where a set of stone stairs enter from above. 
Most of the rooms are taken up by cluttered bookshelves, crammed 
with old tomes, books, scrolls, parchments, and the occasional 
decrepit artifact or antique. Niches carved into the walls 
provide spaces for candles, each kept a respectable distance from 
nearby shelves to avoid accidents. The air here does not move, 
and motes of dust hang perpetually in the darkness. 
   A bronze door is set at the top of the staircase within a 
rectangular stone pillar.

to a wooden frame and covered with a slanting roof. Stray has

Within the Tended Fields of Anorien, Nigh to Osgiliath~
   Lying under the dark shadow of the broken city of Osgiliath, 
these tended fields sit within reach of the ancient walls of 
grey stone. Covered in small brooks and rolling plains, these 
lands are green and full of the sounds of life despite their 
close proximity to the decrepit city which looms to the east of 
here.

The Emerald Leaf~
   Encased on three sides by wooden walls that have been crudely 
painted a deep emerald green, this small stall has a low counter 
in the centre of the space. Around the enclosing sides are long, 
shallow metal troughs set on short wooden supports that hold the 
troughs perhaps half a foot above the floor. The troughs contain 
inch deep water, in which sits clay pots of all sizes with an 
assortment of plants for sale. The planked floor is well swept, 
but stained from soil and water.

A Modest Storage Area~
   Several rows of troughs line this modest nursery, each of 
varying depth and width, though all of them have a riot of colour 
and scents coming from them. Left nearly completely open to the 
elements only a thin treated canvas provides some protection to 
the elements. Around the edge a fence has been built, given a 
lick of emerald paint it protects the plants from the wind.

An Earthen Courtyard With A Fenced Off Grassy Centre~
   Barely large enough to turn a loaded cart, this packed earth 
yard is sheltered by the log wall of the cabin to the north, and 
a stone-walled workshop south. Two hooded lanterns attached on 
either side of the northern door provide dim illumination at 
night. Directly in the centre of the yard is a two foot high 
picket fence, painted a creamy sky blue. Inside the fence is a 
circular patch of well-tended grass perhaps two and a half 
strides across.

western wall. Opposite, the wall is obscured with an assortment 
of containers that sit on the dark stone floor. Flanking the 
door in the center of the northen wall are racks designed for 
tools. A glassless, shuttered window in the southern wall allows 
in both light and a cool breeze to compete with the lantern-lit, 
warm room, but also permits the surrounding farmland to be seen, 
the mountain rising in the distance.

A Wide Earthen Floored Wagonyard~
   Large enough to easy turn a moderate-sized wagon, this yard is 
floored by pitted, uneven, hard-packed earth. Reaching westwards 
is an open courtyard while a low wall, covering the east and 
south walls, connects the wooden cabin to the north with a stone 
walled building in the southwest. Set in the eastern wall is a 
green-painted, five-barred wooden gate leading to a large garden, 
while a lantern-flanked high, vaulted gate allows access to a 
trail leading southwards into the surrounding fields. Against 
the wall of the cabin is a wooden trellis covered in 
purple-flowered climbing plants during the warmer months, and 
just their dark green leaves during winter. Set into the trellis 
is a small gap that allows access to the half-hidden compost 
piles beyond. To the south a sturdy barn has been built.

A Large, Cultivated Garden~
   A cobblestone path runs down the very gentle incline from the 
northern half of the garden, splitting and leading around through 
the plant-life in this area in a teardrop shape. Around the edge 
of the garden, the plants are thick and densely packed. At first 
glance, they might appear to lack any sign of being tended, but 
upon closer inspection, although each plant is left to flourish, 
careful tending has lead them to remain separate, free of any 
pests or dying matter. At the southern, rounded apex of the 
path, a wide space has been cleared free of foliage leaving a 
stretch of barren land. While the plants outside the path sprawl 
over it in tangled tendrils, the plants within the centre of the 
path are strictly tamed, the grass kept short and tidy, a number 
of flowerpots arranged around along the path. A four foot high 
dry stone wall surrounds the garden, appearing from the northeast 
winding around the foliage and then returning towards the cabin 
in the northwest.

small shrubs surround a cabin to the north, berries and vines 
guided and tied to start to grow up the walls.

The Main Room of the Cabin~
   This moderate size room is warm and has a rather cozy feel to 
it. The walls are made of pine planks with a light stain just to 
protect the wood and not take away from the natural beauty of the 
planks. On the northern wall a river-rock chimney has been built 
to provide warmth during the wintertime. The floor is made of 
birch that has been sanded and stained to a nice dark brown. 
Windows are set into the south wall, one on either side of the 
entrance door, while a blue woolen curtain hangs in a doorway to 
the west that leads to the kitchen. The east door leads to a 
bedroom, and a set of stairs can be seen in the far northeastern 
corner that leads upstairs.

   This kitchen is comfortable and rather homey looking. In the 
northern corner of the room is a stone fireplace built into the 
wall; light coming from it as it heats the room when lit. The 
room is spacious enough to be able to hold several people in it 
and have a table with plenty of room for people to move around. 
Several wooden shelves have been built into the eastern wall. On 
the western wall is a window with maple colored shutters. The 
window is just the right height to be able to admire the beauty 
of the grass and farmlands that can be seen while cooking. A 
blue, woolen curtain separates the kitchen from the main room to 
the east, while a trap door not too far from the doorway can be 
seen leading to the cellar.

to be split into two sections by a rather large curtain that runs 
right smack in the middle. To the east of the room are the 
windows that allow the light into the room. To the west is the

A sturdily-built pine door leads to the outside, a mullioned 
glass window set into the wall on either side of it. Off to one 
side, a sturdy wooden staircase reaches upward, leading to an 
upstairs room. Overhead, heavy log beams run across the ceiling,

walls are of heavy pine logs, like the rest of the structure, 
notched and fitted together, the cracks filled with some form of 
clay substance. A square cut in a side wall allows room for a

Sturdy gates made wholly of oak are situated along a trail that 
runs east-to-west from the woods towards the cabin. The fence 
curves around to the northwest and southwest, enclosing the cabin 
while a small clearing separates the fence from the dense birch 
surrounding it. South and west, the forest is thin, breaking 
into the open lands of Anorien's fields.

of pine offers inhabitants protection from sliding off and 
falling to the copse below. Two more sections of pine planks 
have been nailed into the thick branches that rise and surround 
this platform at chest and shoulder height. Branches and foliage 
have been wrapped about these to grant privacy from prying eyes

Western Walls of the Valley~
   Edging the walls of the valley at this side are small bushes 
and precariously jutting stunted trees above. The stream flowing 
from the east finds its way through the wall by means of an 
opening covered by metal bars, spaced too closely to allow a 
person to swim through. Overgrown and tangled amongst the 
bracken and brambles, cracked and broken pillars lay resting 
amongst the undergrowth. Weather-worn and faded, patterns show 
through here and there of circular patterns and branches. The 
wildlife here is abundant and a constant sound of birds and 
insects sings out.

planking serve as walls, floors, and ceiling in this lonely 
windowed space. The room has a fair amount of furniture and at 
times could easily seem crowded. 
   To the west leads into the sitting room.

A Comfortable Light-Green Bedroom~
   To the north, east, and west thick shuttered windows allow 
light and air into the room and can be closed against the 
elements in inclement weather. The walls here have been painted 
a soft light green color to give it a comfortable feel. The 
wooden floor has been polished, smooth to the touch of ones feet. 
   A sturdy door leads south into an office.

An Open Farm Field~
   The neglected fields are roughly about the size of an acre. 
It is large enough to accommodate a few crops, yet manageable by 
a single man. A small area is sectioned off by loose ropes and 
serves as a training area. A building is set to the east, 
detached from the nearby farmhouse and of newer but similar 
construction.

Beside the Big House~
   The path continues through a well kept yard cut from the 
Anorian farmlands. Lush grass stretches from a farmhouse to the 
east and a rather large greenhouse to the west. Gardens surround 
the buildings suffusing this area in heady perfumes when the 
flowers are in bloom.

Inside the Glass Barn~
   This cedar framed glass structure is surprisingly large, 
almost as big as a barn. On a sunny day there are few shadows 
cast from building itself, and those shift with Anor's progress 
in the skies above. The front wall with the door is actually a 
door itself, able to swing out on a wheeled support rod.

A Narrow Path Girded by Low Fences leading to Green Acres Farm~
   This narrow path leads from a dusty trail toward a small 
farmyard, across which can be seen a small stone-built cottage 
and a barn with a new roof. Fields stretch to the northwest and 
the myriad of farms across the Pelennor spread out in all 
directions.

A Small Square Farmyard~
   This small farmyard has a mud-packed floor which throws up 
dust on warm summer days. It is edged on one side by a small 
stone-built cottage, which sits beside a woodframe barn with a 
new roof. Opposite the barn is a field, recently cleared. A 
five bar gate hangs firmly on a painted oak post with iron 
hinges. The cottage itself has clearly seen recent repair, its 
roof newly tiled, with clean symmetrically laid slate.

lesser tangles of bindweed vines and dogwood clumps. The fences 
are sound, with solid oak planks firming up a repaired section at 
the far end of the field. A new gate post has been set at the 
eastern segment of the fence, leading to a yard beyond with a 
barn and cottage.

well-arranged for cooking and small gatherings. A stone 
fireplace sits in the centre of the eastern wall, its chimney 
nearly flat against the wall. The bare pale stone of the cottage

looks to be in need of cleaning as the smell of its previous 
resident still lingers in the air. Patches of lumber have been 
teak-stained and nailed in place over old holes. Great lengths 
of oak have been secured above to carry the weight of a new roof, 
slightly tilted up and keeping out the elements with its pine and 
oak lumber nailed firmly in place.

a pot-belly stove. A treacherous length of stovepipe has been
jury-rigged with bits of wire and nails as it stretches away

Woman's Dorm in a Cozy Bunkhouse~
This small room offers some modicum of privacy from the chaos
often found in the front, and a decidedly softer touch is found among
the decor. Large windows with heavy, latched shutters afford a view
of the fields in the distance to the east and growing orchards off to
the south. The smooth wooden planks of the floor are left bare, while
on the western wall, an area has been reserved for a firepit or brazier
to keep this small room, and its residents, warm on cold nights.
    The northern wall appears to be newer, and looks to have been
built with lumber planks, not logs, the color and odor fresher and
the craftsmanship seems to be lacking slightly compared to the
other walls in the room.

A Caved-In Sitting Room~
   The roof of this room has completely collapsed under the 
massive weight of snow upon it, making it difficult to fit into 
the room at all without clearing paths through the icy white 
substance. The temperature inside is low enough that one can 
easily see their breath. To the west, a half-staircase can be 
partially seen, its remainder decimated and blocking what must be 
a hallways judging from the appearance of the structure from the 
outside. The ceiling hangs low over the northern end of the 
room, and to the east the very top of a doorframe can be seen 
through all of the snow amassed before it.

A Snow-Trapped Kitchen~
   A majority of this room has been saved from the wreckage the 
mountain snow has made of the rest of the cabin. Only the 
windows, broken and having taken in snow to line the floor along 
their respective walls, and the fireplace, its chimney crushed 
and flooded with snow to spill onto the floor, appear to have 
taken much damage, though it is rather dark inside due to the 
snow outside reaching well over the roof overhead. The 
temperature here is uncomfortably frigid.

is frosty and damp. A few toys and books are scattered about the 
floor, but if there was anyone occupying this room before the 
snowfall, they are now buried beneath wreckage and snow.

Before a Sprawling Cabin~
   This yard outside a sprawling cabin contains a mixture of 
slushy, spring-melting snow and, atop that, a heavy, dense snow 
from upon the mountain, where winter still reigns. To the north, 
nestled against the mountain is a wooden cabin, appearing to have 
once been two stories high, though the second story is all but 
completely destroyed. Not much of the cabin can be seen for the 
mass of snow upon it, but a section jutting out near the middle 
is the most likely place for a door. No windows are visible 
behind the snow encompassing this building, and the mounds of 
snow surrounding it make it impossible to get anywhere near the 
structure unless paths are dug.

A Spacious Wooden Barn ~
   Although simple in form, this barn is quite large, with a high 
vaulted ceiling that comes to a sharp peak. Many beams 
criss-cross its length, coming together at supporting pillars 
evenly spaced throughout. The floors and walls are rough-hewn 
and of the same wood as the beams, a pale hickory whorled and 
marked with darker knots and grooves. A few large stalls take up 
a good portion of the space, walls high enough to keep animals 
from escaping, with swinging gates latching in front. The main 
source of light is from a large rectangular window over the 
double doors, though a pair of plain glass and iron oil lamps are 
mounted to either side of the entrance. The air smells of the 
pungent odor of farm animals and fresh hay, wisps of the latter 
scattered about the floor.

little plots of plants are lined neatly together, like a 
miniature battalion of plants. In the general area, an old

rather it seems old and weathered, like it has survived in the

A large Autumn Orchard, Lined With Rows of Trees~
   Tall trees of varying heights with leaves of equally varying 
colors stretch out, extending their branches towards the 
nourishing sunlight. They are spaced far enough apart that it's 
possible to see the sun above during the daylight hours, but it 
would be hard to see much else aside from the occasional bird or 
overhead squirrel here. The wagon path curves around the manor 
here, continuing its circuit about the manor

A Stall Lined Barn Room~
   A set of traditional double barn doors leads out to reveal the 
farmlands to the south, while inside can be seen some cow stalls 
running along the western side of the wall, the floor is a 
combination of dirt and stray bits of straw which have escaped 
the stalls or nearby pile of hay. Along the east wall there is a 
door leading to a small workroom, presumably where cheeses and 
other farm products are made, while a ladder leads up to the 
second floor.

A Small Work Room~
   A plain and Spartan room with a dirt floor, there is very 
little distinctive about this room at all. It is only lightly 
furnished, most of its room dedicated to space for hanging tools 
or benches, and other necessities for performing work within the 
barn away from the cows.

   A spacious room, looking as if it was meant as a greeting area 
for guests where they can set aside their heavier outside wear 
and wipe their boots on a plain straw mat before continuing 
further into the dwelling. A spiraling stone staircase rises up 
to the side, where one can find their way to the landing on the 
second floor.

or two dozen people without serious issue, with a high vaulted 
ceiling and an oaken door leads to the north where one can smell 
the scents of cooking and herbs, while to the east an open 
archway reveals an even larger room than the dining room.

An Open Kitchen, Leading Out Into the Gardens~
   Aromatic smells surround the kitchen, and when it's being 
worked in, it can become quite warm for those not used to being 
in an active kitchen. Fireplace, stove and oven are all set 
apart for different cooks to be able to work shoulder to shoulder 
without disturbing the other's work. There's a door to the north 
which leads outside, while the door to the south leads back into 
the dining hall.

A Second Story Landing~
   A modest landing, with doors set in each of the four cardinal 
directions. Each of the doors is made of oak and set with a 
scene. The door to the north depicts a view of the river Anduin 
passing by the Harlond docks, while the eastern door pictures 
forested lands, presumably those of Ithilien, the southern doors 
show an image of rural plains and farmlands common in Anorien and 
the western door shows a likeness of the great mountain 
Mindolluin.

grassy yard. Streaks of yellow paint follow the line of the 
doorframe in a dainty floral pattern. The shed has shutters on 
the side walls and rear. A small path leads back eastwards to 
the yard.

A Humble Shed~
   Planks of wood make up the walls of this humble sized shed, 
though despite its size there is plenty of room, affording it 
many uses. Painted in cheery yellow are tiny bell-shaped 
flowers, forming a border along the top of the walls where the 
ceiling meets. Shutters along the north, south and west wall are 
brightly painted in the same yellow as the flowers, giving the 
room a welcoming touch as well as ample light when opened. 
Shelves line three of the four walls and are each strategically 
placed below a shutter. The floor of this modest shed is covered 
with firmly packed soil and has been recently swept of any loose 
debris.

A Roofless Stonewall-Enclosed Yard~
   This spacious section of the fields behind the barn is 
enclosed in a high stone wall - high enough even for a tall man 
to look over. The whole area is carpeted with a thin layer of 
gravel, with some small weedy pacthes of bare earth scattered 
throughout. A well-worn path of stone snakes through towards the 
distant corner ending at the base of a stone well.

   In the northeast corner of the room is a stone fireplace built 
into the wall, warmth fills the room when it happens to be lit. 
The room is lit during the day by the light of the sun that comes 
through the rather large window on the western wall, set very 
high and level with the loft. Some rather simple plain wooden 
shelves adorn the eastern wall. 
   There are multiple doors here, including trapdoors, all 
leading to other rooms of the cozy farmhouse.

An Office Loft Above the Kitchen~
   This little loft area takes up about half the space of the 
kitchen below and is modestly furnished. A thick wooden railing 
climbs up the staircase and continues along the edge of the 
floor, acting as a divider and safety precaution. Noise and 
smells carry frequently into the room from below. 
   A sturdy door is settled to the north, opposite the southern 
set stairway.

   With barely enough room for three people to comfortably stand

one entire wall, almost from floor to ceiling, with the exception 
of the gaps left in order to fill them. A lack of windows adds 
to the crowded feel of this closet.

windows with at least one large one in every wall except the one 
with the door. Polished wooden floors run underfoot and the 
ceiling is vaulted.

   This dug-out section below the farmhouse kitchen is ideally

temperature. Little has been done to make the space seem 
friendly or warm, including the lack of a real floor. Walls are 
present, however, but their only real decor are hooks and shelves

easily fill up the space while still leaving enough room to move 
about comfortably. The windows are small, allowing for a good 
slumbering atmosphere even in the daytime. 
   A short staircase leads down into the sitting room.

   This stall has been simply, but sturdily made of wooden 
planks. Two poles stuck in the ground rise up to support a 
slanted roof while the walls are also made of planks sanded 
smooth but left untreated. The front part of the stall is left 
totally open, allowing a breeze to waft inside. A few shelves

This room has very little furniture other than a working 
workbench, shelves and a few bins. 
   The way out is through the double doors to the east.
