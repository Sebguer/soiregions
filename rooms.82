A Passage Meeting Some Stairs~
   The stairs reach a level floor here, the carefully laid stone 
tiles slippery from a light layer of dark-green mould. The walls 
are covered in this same mould and on their once-white plaster 
surface a mural, depicting a gathering of dark-skinned men in 
formal attire, can faintly be seen. The northern wall has fallen 
away completely, nothing left but debris. To the west a dark 
arched passage opens up while small vermin and insects dart along 
the floor.

Plummeting Downwards~
   Exquisite carvings of lions and scorpions on the stone walls 
of this room pass by as if in slow motion as you fall. A caved 
in archway blocks the eastern wall, preventing any passage. In 
the distance to the south is an intact arch with its black 
passage stretching into impenetrable darkness. A jagged crack in 
the floor looms above, its yawning mouth just out of reach. A 
broken ledge juts out from the southern wall. The air is dank 
and musty and mould grows on the rotting plaster and stones.

A Stairway Leading Off The Docks~
   A few slippery stone stairs lead down here off the dock and 
onto a small wooden deck in order to allow workmen easier access 
to smaller vessels. The deck and stairs allow room for only a 
few men to fit without danger of falling into the water around 
them. Slimy green algae covers the stairs from years of exposure 
to the Sheshem-Mew but the dock seems to have been kept clean of 
this, either by conscious effort or through constant use. A 
large wooden support pole for the dock is here, descending beyond 
the blue-green surface of the river

Shallow Waters Beside The Dock~
   The blue-green water of the Sheshem-Mew river surrounds you as 
you swim. Fish, big and small, rush away from you to safer 
confines. Support poles can be seen breaking the surface of the 
water overhead whilst below you the seabed is covered in sand, 
swirling with the easy current. A large grate can be seen under 
the dock, slightly ajar.

Under The Dock~
   Water laps about your knees, its murky colour not quite hiding 
the stone floor underfoot. The ceiling is low, wooden planks 
running across with the occasional sound of people passing over 
your head, the footsteps echoing in this small space. The floor 
rises steadily until it becomes hard to stand straight. The 
floor stops at the end of this small passage, a dark drop opening 
up ahead of it.

Along A Dark Hallway~
   The hallway turns eastwards here, coming from a flight of 
carefully laid stairs to the north. The floor is damp and the 
walls are covered in a light layer of dark-green mould, a collage 
of pictures on the once-white plaster depicting everyday scenes, 
from weaving to farming, all of the characters in the mural 
dark-skinned. The mural is broken due to a large crack in the 
southern wall whilst to the north a small flight of stairs 
continue under a stone archway. An elaborately-worked, rusty 
iron grate is set in the north-western corner of the room, its 
latch broken. A foul smell permeates through the air here, 
seeming to come from the north.

A Large, Converted Barracks~
   This large room differs from the rest of the ruins, its walls 
cleaned of mould and the floor recently swept. A mural, clearly 
retouched, works its way around the room on all four stone walls 
depicting dark-skinned scholars toiling over scrolls of 
parchment, a frieze of alternating scarabs and scorpions skirting 
the ceiling. Two columns, easily the most noticeable part of the 
room, stand strong in the middle of the room - their fluted stone 
seeming to hold the stone ceiling in place. 
   There is a man-sized crack in the northern wall.

   The grandeur and cleanliness of the eastern room continues 
here, though the dank smell of stagnant air is more notable in 
this room. The white-plastered walls of this room are bare 
except for the flickering flames of torches, spreading a dim glow 
of light around the room. Clearly furnished to act as a meeting 
area; a few men spread around this room, neither quiet nor loud 
though all are seemingly cautious.

A Small, Spartan Kitchen~
   This small room, possibly once used for storage, has been 
furnished with the wares of a kitchen; stove, shelves and oven 
cluttering the tiny space. The walls are plain and only a few 
torches are mounted on their plastered surface, making the 
lighting poor and often flickering. A weird smell permeates 
through the room, a mixture of burnt meat, stagnant air and 
burning oil.

   This room is wide and long, stretching out to the west and 
north from this corner. The walls are made of precisely laid 
stone, covered with crumbling plaster and bearing faded murals of 
dark-skinned women dancing alongside a lone harp player. Water 
licks at the walls leaving a brown ring of grime to mark its 
highest point at almost waist level. A short flight of stairs 
peaks out of this murky water in the western wall, leading 
through an archway.

   A small layer of water is present atop these carefully laid 
stone stairs, making passage slightly difficult. Walls of 
crumbling white plaster lead into a room to the west, dark mould 
covering the remaining sections of the walls. The high ceiling 
rises overhead, small pieces of debris occasionally dropping into 
the water underfoot. Vermin make passage over the floor, 
apparently unconcerned with the human presence as they scurry 
about.

The End of a Short Corridor~
   The corridor comes to an abrupt halt here, the western wall 
having caved in. Large rocks and debris are littered about the 
area, the damage to the walls quite significant, part of the 
northern wall having fallen away as well. A small trickle of 
water leaks out through the collapsed wall, whose murals have 
faded many years ago. Small pieces of ceiling drop down every 
now and then; too small to do much harm but adding to the 
eeriness of the area as they splash onto the thin layer of water 
on the floor. Vermin and insects traverse the area, most 
scurrying into and out of the hole in the northern wall.

A Small, Discrete Shop~
   This small, surprisingly well kept room has been furnished as 
a shop, though very little wares line the shelves. The walls 
have been re-plastered, the old plaster showing through in places 
with its dull yellow contrasting against the new, white plaster. 
The stonework of the floor has been redone, a tile scarab 
dominating the elaborate granite tiling. Few people seem to 
frequent this store, and all of them are cautious to reveal 
themselves or say much. Despite the renovation of the room there 
are still signs of its ruin, the most noticeable a hole in the 
northern section of the ceiling.

Balancing on a Crumbling Ledge~
   Rocks tumble precariously down into the darkness beyond this 
small ledge here, the faint sound of them hitting the ground 
below barely heard. Darkness surrounds this small precipice of 
granite stone though a flickering torch on the southern wall 
provides just enough light to look for suitable footing. A 
stairwell, narrow and as decrepit as the ledge you stand on, 
leads downwards here, making its way into the darkness.

Narrow Staircase Surrounded by Darkness~
   The narrow staircase continues down into the darkness here, 
the occasional torch lighting the way. A crumbling ledge breaks 
off to the west here, though the way seems unsure. The rest of 
the area mimics that of the stairway, once well laid granite 
blocks fallen into disrepair and damaged by both time and man. 
The only seemingly solid wall is the one to the south and even it 
bears large gaps, the flickering light showing some sort of room 
beyond the wall.

The Ruins of a Grand Foyer~
   Rubble litters the floor of this room, occasional pieces of 
debris falling from above and a collapsed western wall the 
apparent source of this. A narrow, crumbling staircase leads 
upwards from this room, the broken and faded repairs indicating 
its previous use to be somewhat of a lobby. The room is large 
and the stonework is exquisite, though now damaged and covered 
with the scars of time and wear. The murals on the faded plaster 
walls depict fully armoured men standing guard, one upon each 
wall, dark-skinned and bearing the finest of bronze equipment and 
arms.

   This room is of moderate size and made entirely of stones, 
with hairline joints between each expertly laid granite block in 
the floor, walls and ceiling. A series of wooden shelves line 
the walls either side and behind the counter, an exotic range of 
powders, leaves and resins contained in jars along their wooden 
lengths. The room is filled with a mix of scents; sweet, tangy 
and those in between meeting the nostrils in a bizarre mix. The 
few patrons of this shop all seem quite cautious and most do not 
stick around for very long.
