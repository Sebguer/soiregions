tunic patched threadbare heap linen TEXTILE~
a patched, threadbare linen tunic~
A patched tunic made of threadbare linen lies here in a heap.~
   This patched linen tunic has seen much wear, being old enough 
that the linen, once dark grey, has faded to a pale, white-grey 
colour, similar to clouds in spring. Several patches cover areas 
of the tunic that have seen older use, and the fabric has become 
worn, especially at the hem and sleeves. Despite its age, it's 
of decent make originally, with good strong seams even on the 
patches.

contains a series of small loops on the inside, from which 6 wiry

very end. They are of slightly different lengths and sizes, one 
of which is as small as a needle but comes to three or four 
inches in length. All in all it is an odd and varied set of 
tools.

A beautiful, steel shortsword lies here, its pommel fashioned into a serpentine form.~
   This short sword has a wickedly curving blade making it 
excellent for hacking or flaying flesh. It is of a beautiful 
design and its blade is razor sharp. Twin, black leather grips 
lead down to a serpentine handle formed into the image of a 
viper. The swords blade guard is made of a solid steel, likely 
of dwarven refinement. All in all this gorgeous weapon is both 
easy to masterfully control and deadly, likely to catch a pretty 
penny at almost any weapons store across middle-earth.

amused, her smile forms a slight dimple. Long legged and skinny, 
her movements are graceful.

pitchfork wooden shaft iron tool METAL~
an iron pitchfork with a wooden shaft~
A pitchfork with iron prongs and a wooden shaft has been left here.~
   Designed for use on the farm for lifting hay, sheaves of grain 
and other such things, this pitchfork is as long as a short man, 
the oak used in its construction solid and its iron head sturdy. 
Three prongs form out from the fork head, the iron lacklustre yet 
strong enough to last many years before a new pitchfork will be 
required.

a broad-tipped chisel~
A chisel with a broad tip has been forgotten here.~
   A sanded down handle allows a firm grip without fear of 
splinters for this chisel, the end bulbous in shape to allow 
plenty of room for a hammer to strike down upon. The tip is an 
angled piece of smelted iron, rather broad in shape, and solid 
enough to survive the rigours of work such a tool would be put 
through.

a short, hand-held hatchet~
A short hatchet designed to be held in the hand is here.~
   This short axe is easily able to be held in a single hand, the 
wooden haft not nearly long enough to bear two hands upon it. 
The iron head of the hatchet has been smelted with mediocre 
skills and materials, this tool designed for the cutting of 
firewood rather than the carnage of battle.

a broad-headed axe~
A broad-headed axe lies here.~
   The oak helve of this axe is rather long, extending the length 
of the axe to be far too unwieldly for proper use in combat. 
Instead, this axe, with its broad iron head, is designed to be 
used for felling trees, chopping and splitting wood and hewing 
timber, as well as any number of other purposes along those 
lines.

tapering down to a narrow stem.

An elegant pipe carved from rosewood lies here.~
   Carved from dark rosewood, this pipe is rather heavy to hold 
in the hand for its comparative size, thanks to the material from 
which it has been built. Painstaking skill has gone into 
fashioning the elegant shape of the pipe as its length curves 
upwards at a slight angle, and tiny wisps of smoke have been 
engraved along its surface.

   About two inches in width, this heavy strap of leather has 
been tanned and then dyed a strong $color. Several holes line 
the center of its length, about an inch apart and allowing a 
taper to a rounded point toward the end. A simple buckle of some 
dull, silver metal adorns the center of this belt, when worn.

A worn, chipped bench made of marble has been set here.~
   White marble has been used in the fashioning of this bench, 
containing enough room to seat three people. It is of simple 
design, a single piece of marble having been used to construct 
the back and seat, and two more pieces to build the curved legs 
that support the bench. Whilst originally a work of expertise 
and skill, now the bench bears many chips and scars throughout 
its surface, looking rather worn.

   Large enough to perhaps house a number of people within its 
boundaries, this large fountain is round in shape. Crafted from 
marble of the purest white, it still bears a number of small 
marks and scratches that ring around the base of it. Clear water 
streams forth from the mouths of a trio of regal featured figures 
carved from the same marble as the fountain and set in the center 
of the water. Two crouch down at the feet of the other, which 
stands upright and bears a spartan crown upon his head.

#6Some OOC graffiti has been scrawled on a wall here.#0~
   Most of the graffiti is crude messages of unsavoury nature,
scratched into the wall by bored administrators.

   However, some of it is intelligible, and reads as thus - Type
'request food' and 'request clothes' to stay fed and clothed
during your stay in the jailhouse. For those wishing to leave,
please be advised that you will most likely have to spend some
time in here until you have been considered to have paid your
burden to society. It is important to note that the code only
uses the time that you spend online in order to determine how
long you should enjoy the conforts of the cell, and thus quitting
for an extended period of time will still leave you stranded in
the cell.

   To be brief, if you have committed a small offence, for
example larceny or brawling, you could be released in a matter of
days after paying a fine or other service. For larger crimes
such as arson, treason or murder your stay could become very
protracted indeed. In either case, it is best to contact either
the admins or enforcers of this particular city.

   The email staff(at)middle-earth.us is the place to call for
admins of all sorts. To get in contact with an enforcer simply
leave a message on the bulletin board on the SoI web page asking
for an enforcer to contact you at your email address. In
addition, of course, be sure to supply your email address.
Alternatively, if you know the name of an enforcer character, you
can send them a message using hobbit mail!

   For now, enjoy the rich adventure of sitting in a dank cell
filled with convicts and criminals!

   Also, be advised that being imprisoned under martial law may
involve torture or other objectionable roleplay. As is stated in
our game policies, located at:

http://www.middle-earth.us/index.php?display=policies#objectionable

if you do not wish for such roleplay to proceed, please
requestfor it to stop via OOC, and the enforcer that is
administering it will stop. Any violations of this will be
punished most severely.

To request treatment from the physician, the TREAT command is used:

  - treat value <all/bodypart> : receive an appraisal of a wound
  - treat <all/bodypart>       : request treatment of wound(s)

Examples:

  > treat value all
  > treat value lforearm
  > treat all
  > treat skull

Note that most physicians will give you a 'discount' when treating
multiple wounds, so that treating all your wounds at once will be
significantly cheaper than treating them all separately.

Enjoy!

groove runs between them, reaching nearly to the other end of the 
key.

of iron chain connects to the head of the weapon allowing the 
wielder of the flail to swing the head forward to deal a much 
harder blow. The head of the weapon itself is similar to a 
morning star, a thick iron layer has been attached to the pine 
with a row of long, heavy iron spikes attached to it. If this 
weapon were to be wielded with enough force it could easily deal 
a crushing or killing blow against someone in plate armor.

to last a lifetime, this isnt the sort of piece designed to

The Tree of Gondor has also been engraved upon the end of the 
cross-guards and pommel. The sword is of mediocre quality, the 
significant effort of decoration that has been put in the blade 
detracting from its use as a weapon to kill.

an unadorned, iron breastplate~
A simple breastplate fashioned from iron has been left here.~
   Of decent craftsmanship, this piece of armour is still
sturdy and secure enough to ward off most blows to the chest. 
The breastplate has been beaten from smelted iron, but bears no 
ornamentation upon its surface. Covering the chest and the upper 
regions of the abdomen, the iron plate curves slightly outwards
from the top. A pair of thick leather straps allows it to be held
in place, with a small buckle on each allowing adjustments to its
size and fit.

An old cart sits abandoned here, a pile of empty crates behind it.~
   The wooden slates which form the body of this old cart are dry 
and weak, no doubt caused by the lack of attention and care it 
has received since being abandoned. Stacked up behind it are 
numerous crates and boxes left in a similar condition, the 
occasional container filled with dust or other useful items. 
There are numerous places for one to seat themselves upon the 
structure and take some relief from the fast pace on life upon 
the docks. The crates and cart have been shoved aside to nestle 
up against the wall of a warehouse.

process involving layers of lacquer and stiffened hide. 
Individual scales of stiffened leather have been cut into 
wave-shapes, dyed a sea-green, and placed decoratively and 
protectively across the front and back of the piece. It looks 
like it could turn a blade, but would not be as protective as 
most metal armor.

when going in. Unsightly though obviously battleworthy, this 
spear makes a formidable weapon in a trained user's hands.

   This sword has a long and tapering blade that comes to a very 
fine point. Unlike many swords which have a groove in the blade, 
this sword has a ridge which runs the length of the blade, making 
the blade very rigid and reinforcing the point. It has very 
little edge to it, and with the weight of the blade close to the 
hands, it would probably not cut very well. It has a large 
pommel, which helps bring the center of balance towards the hand.

lamp MAGIC_ITEM UNIQUE_ITEM blue-glowing small engraved steel chain aura emanating METAL~
a small, engraved-steel lamp emanating a blue glow~
A small, engraved-steel lamp left here radiates a soft-blue aura.~
   A fine alloy of iron metal has been used to form the small, 
yet perfectly round, lamp. Perhaps a dozen sylvan runes are 
engraved in a row about this lamp, gracing the metal shell of 
this artefact with their strange yet simplistic beauty. A 
section of the fine metal has been cut away, leaving a small hole 
for the pale-blue glow that constantly emits from this lamp to 
shine forth. Neither wick nor fuel seems to be present within 
this hole, just an unearthly light that illuminates without 
fault, casting its wyrding light far. A long chain attached to a 
small ring at the top of the lantern allows one to hold it 
securely in their hand, or to attach it at their belt.

piece of dinning-ware has been fashioned from an odd alloy of 
metal, its appearance a rich gold in colour, yet far stronger and 
lighter than that particular mineral. The edges of this large 
plate are slightly raised, and etched upon them is a pattern of 
vines bearing large groups. In the centre of the plate is a 
detailed engraving - 
   A vast mountain range sweeps over all that can be seen, yet 
one peak raises high above all those around it, ascending further 
and further into the sky until it pierces the hazy clouds that 
cluster about it. At the base of the mountains fields stretch 
out, distance and oddly-shaped constructions visible at the very 
edge of the horizon.

broth or stew, the surface of the bowl has been buffed into a 
heavy shine, even though many small nicks exist in the metal. On 
the outside of the bowl, a pattern of vines bearing large grapes 
runs. In the middle of the bowl is a detailed engraving -

part of the body. The iron alloy is easily polished to hold a 
bright shine, and is tough enough to ward off all but the most 
critical of attacks. A strip of leather acts as padding for the 
interior of the gorget, and a series of holes punched in matching 
ends of the two separate pieces of metal allows the neckpiece to 
be fitted. Three stars have been engraved in the metal of the 
gorget.

nothing less than both hands for all save those with the girth 
and strength of a troll, this weapon is heavy, obviously so, 
meant for use by brute force rather than finesse. The head of 
the weapon is in a typical hammer shape, a broad striking surface 
sloping back to a dull point. Engraved upon the surface is the 
sigil of the Tree of Gondor, the thin branches seeming to almost 
cradle the seven stars about it.

the vest is a long-sleeved white linen shirt, soft and comfortable-

An ancient, gnarled willow tree curves its boughs over the riverside.~
   This large, drooping tree appears to have seen countless years 
go by, the time flowing much like the river it grows beside. 
Thick roots cling to the soil and boulders that line the bank, 
and long, gnarled branches reach over the waters. The wisp-thin, 
hanging leaves that grow from its branches dangle down like a 
curtain, many of them touching the water.

   Evenly dyed a deep crimson, this tabard is made of decent
quality linen and sewn by a steady hand. This tabard doesn't seem
to offer much in the way of warmth or protection from the weather.
A deep hood has been sewn onto the tabard, offering the wearer at
least some protection from the elements. Upon the breast is an
embroidered hawk, made with black thread and given an outline in
white. The garment falls to the wearer's thighs, and is sleeveless,
just a long rectangle with a hole in the middle for one's head,
in essence.

A pair of bolts and clamps have been secured on one end so the owner
could take a fairly good hit on this hand before losing it completely,
though this would likely cause great pain to the owner. The hook itself
could be used to stab or grab at something, but little more.

a suit of bronze platemail~
A suit of bronze platemail stands upright against the northern wall, supported by a wooden stand.~
   This suit of bronze platemail stands fully upright, supported 
by some sort of wooden stand. The breastplate is made from thick 
layers of bronze, formed into two pieces. An elaborate series of 
buckles run down the sides of the breastplate, fastening the two 
halves together. Thick bronze plates are attatched to the 
shoulders and waist, and are jointed slightly to allow for 
movement. The breastplate is polished to a bright shine, and 
though unadorned, is sturdily made. Sitting on top of the 
breastplate is a bronze plate gorget, which is fastened with 
several buckles through rings on the front of the breastplate. 
The gorget is little more than a finger length in height, but is 
made from thick bands of bronze, riveted with iron studs, and 
looks very well crafted. Fastened to the sides of the 
breastplate with a similar series of buckles are a pair of bronze 
scale-sleeves. The sleeves consist of hundreds of diamond-shaped 
bronze scales, fastened firmly to a leather backing, and extend 
down to a pair of spiked, bronze gauntlets. The gauntlets are 
made from a single layer of thick bronze, and have spikes 
protruding from the knuckles and backs of the hands. A series of 
small straps and buckles run up the sides of the gauntlets, 
allowing them to adjust slightly to different hand-sizes. The 
gauntlets grasp the hilt of a long, bronze scimitar, which stands 
in front of the legs of the suit of armour, point to the ground. 
The legs of the suit are made from thick plates of bronze, and 
are jointed at the waist and knees. They cover the front of the 
calves and shins, but leave the backs of the legs unprotected. 
An elaborate series of thin leather buckles fasten the leg-plates 
together, and run all the way down to the ground.

It is long enough to handle most narrow-bladed weapons. Embossed
on the front surface, near the top, is a hawk, poised as if in 
flight, its wings slightly folded as if it were about to dive, its
talons extended. Further down, pine trees are embossed. The detail
is quite fine, even on such a small area. A series of straps form
a frog to hang the sheath off of a belt or sash.

with bronze buttons going down the side in a column that accentuates
the waist. The vest is worn over a long-sleeved white linen shirt,
soft and comfortable-looking, with a short stand-up collar and a
line of white buttons down its front, to wear as low-cut as one dares.

the grip, crafted into a simple circular shape. The hilt has

edge. The sword overall has a perfect balance and is light in 
the hand.

pristine white linen, this tabard is made of decent quality cloth

much in the way of warmth or protection from the weather. A deep 
hood has been sewn onto the tabard, offering the wearer at least 
some protection from the elements. Upon the breast is an 
embroidered hawk, made with black thread and given an outline in 
white. The garment falls to the wearer's thighs, and is 
sleeveless, just a long rectangle with a hole in the middle for 
one's head, in essence.

iron blade that is dulled from use. One end of the blade comes 
to a sharp point, while the other attaches itself to an

handgrip. Though well-made, its age is beginning to show, as the 
handle's paint has begun to fade and chip, exposing the wood 
underneath. This sickle does not look to be wielded as a weapon, 
though it would likely cause some damage if swung at an 
unsuspecting foe.

razor-sharp edge. The hand guard is heavy-duty; curved away from 
the hand and inward. The knife appears to be blade-heavy, and 
lacks a prominent point, which would seem to imply that most of 
this weapon's damage comes from quick slashes.

A wickedly sharp axe on a long maple-wood haft lies here.~
   Beautifully crafted of fire-hardened maple wood, the shaft of 
this battle-axe is just over an arm's length long, making it 
almost impossible for a normal man to wield with one hand. The 
iron axe-head is truly vicious-looking, with a half-moon shaped 
blade on one side and a pointed spike on the back. Although 
perfectly balanced, the weight and length of this weapon mark it 
as designed for one of superior height and strength.

leather, lined in fur, forms the inside of this helmet,

the neck and cover the ears against the harsher elements. This 
helmet is obviously meant to keep the wearer warm during the 
colder times of the year.

A large sword with a long handle is here, its edge seemingly resplendant in the light.~
   Made of a special alloy, this sword's blade is lighter than 
usual and sturdier. The alloy also allows for the blade to 
remain sharper for a longer period of time. The mass of the 
blade is concentrated along the fuller, allowing momentum into 
its swing, but not so much as to overbalance the wielder. The 
sword is designed to be used either one handed with a shield or 
two handed with its extended grip. The sword has an enlarged 
pommel that serves as a counterbalance for the blade.

   Gleaming and glinting in any light, this ring shines with 
beauty. A half-dozen tiny diamonds have been set in a circle 
around a larger, centered diamond upon its surface. The ring is 
quite peculiar, however; it's cold to the touch and weighs almost 
nothing. The metal is highly polished and seemingly 
unscratchable. Those highly versed in metals, jewelry, or lore 
might see this as mithril; others would see it as some sort of 
alloy.

leather shirt to prevent pinches of flesh by jagged iron scales. 
The small metal plates are poorly shaped like traiangles with 
rounded bottoms and arranged in an overlapping fashion from the 
bottom up with the ocasional bare bit of leather showing. The 
straps extending from the shoulder are for the attachment of 
further arm protection. Greater protection then leather and 
greater mobility than solid plate it has one down fall, the noise 
that comes with movement is a steady din of clings and tinks 
making ones passing hard to miss.

The entire dagger has been riveted together with small, bronze

A pair of fur-lined boots lie on the ground here.~
   This pair of boots is made with smooth and supple brown 
leather. Lining these boots is thick grey rabbit fur. They are 
well made, and of high quality. They are obviously intended to 
keep the wearer's feet warm. Their soles are of thick yet 
pliable leather for a comfortable feel. They rise to about 
mid-calf on most people.

A sign, painted with a sheaf of wheat hangs above the eastern doorway.~
   Hanging above the building's doorway, this sign hangs from a 
couple small hooks. The majority of the sign has been painted a 
dark brown, making it hard to tell what type of wood the sign was 
made from. In the centre of the sign is a sheaf of wheat, 
painted a golden yellow, showing a few details of the wheat.

A wide, moonstone-set silver band rests here.~
   Clutched in a silver setting, a pale oval moonstone cabuchon
stares out at the world. A luminescent sheen plays off the surface
of the stone, while a thin stripe of lightness in the center makes
it look a bit like a cat's eye. The wide band that holds the stone
is simply made of polished silver, with a pair of lines running
along its edges.

an iron full-helm~
A shiny, iron full-helm is here, bronze rivets polished highly.~
   This helm has been made to cover the entire head in a thick 
casing of iron. It is composed of four main sections that are 
held together by bronze rivets that have been polished to a high 
sheen. The only open part of the this helm is that of a small 
rectangle over the eyes. From the middle of that rectangle is a short
opening about half an inch wide extending down to the tip of its
wearer's nose and part of the mouth, making it easier to breathe
and be heard while speaking. The helm is heavy, and thick, but
thankfully well-padded with leather on the inside, making it slightly
more comfortable to wear.

A huge, two-handed axe lies here, a series of engravings visible on its blade.~
   Forged from polished steel, this axe is a tribute to its maker. 
The solid, oakwood handle is finished with a rosy shine, and at 
its end is a spherical steel pommel, from which a series of metal 
vines radiate outwards. The axe has two perfectly symmetrical 
heads, the blades of which are engraved with a series of simple 
markings.

shelves wooden planks makeshift shelf WOOD~
some shelves made of wooden planks~
Some makeshift shelves formed of wooden planks stand against a wall.~
   Made mainly of three wide wooden planks, these shelves look none 
too sturdy, but they will probably serve their purpose. Nailed 
together by way of four supporting wooden poles, the structure 
wobbles a bit on even the most level surface, and a piece of 
canvas is tacked across the back to keep things from falling out. 
The wood is untreated and a bit splintery.

a wobbly wooden table~
A wobbly table squats close to the floor, surrounded by chairs.~
   This table looks like it was made out of scrap material, with a 
wide, squareish plank serving as the top, nailed to four stout 
wooden legs. It doesn't look too dependable, but it will 
probably serve to put meals on. The four chairs clustered around 
it are suprisingly sturdy, but a bit uncomfortable to sit on for 
very long.

A plain nightstand with a round wooden base stands here.~
   Standing about waist-height on the average human, this nighstand 
is functional and plain. It is made of poorly-sanded and 
unstained oak, a few nails visible. A flat, round board serves 
as the base, and a second larger one serves as the top, with a 
thick pole connecting the two.

   This tray is a large wooden circle nearly two feet in diameter. 
It has been fashioned out of five strips of wood, neatly joined 
together. There is a raised lip around the edge to keep things 
from slipping off the tray. The wood has been stained a dark 
color, and it has been lacquered to make it waterproof.

Old and worn, a patchy fur cloak lies here in a heap.~
   Matted and patchy in places, this old cloak is stitched 
together of dull-colored furs. While still somewhat warm to 
wear, it lacks in appearance and has gained a musky odor with age 
and lack of care. The hems have begun coming apart slightly, and 
it fastens at the neck with an old, tarnished bronze pin.

fitting securely but somewhat uncomfortably.

A short, thin cape of $drabcolor wool lies here.~
   Of little use for protection from the elements, this $drabcolor 
wool cape seems rather cheaply made. The material is thin, and 
the cape is cut quite short. Probably made of scrap material, it 
falls unceremoniously down the wearer's back with little attempt 
at style.

   Of simple make, this pair of sandals is little more than two 
vaguely foot-shaped slabs of leather with straps to hold them on 
the feet. Ragged and scuffed, the leather has been worn down and 
is rather thin. Indentations on the sandals' surfaces, smooth 
and sheen, mark the fact that this footwear has been used for 
some time.

   This long, smooth staff has been dyed a dark, forest green and 
has been capped on each end with metal. On one end of the staff, 
a leaf has been carved, and on the other end, the white tree with 
seven stars on its boughs has been carved. The staff is about 
six feet long, and made of a sturdy oak. The length and weight 
make this weapon dependent on two hands wielding it, yet it is 
also very well balanced, and surely a danger in a skilled hand.

   This small boy can't be much older than ten, his spindly frame 
already lanky and slightly bow-legged. His hands are covered in 
drying reddish clay, and he often shifts his weight with 
impatient energy, watching the shop. A shaggy mop of unkempt 
brown hair hangs over his ears and partially obscures his 
moss-green eyes, a snub nose and freckles completing his youthful 
features.

A spindly, mop-haired boy appears to be in excellent condition.

boughs bare no leaves, robbing it of some of its imposing height,

claw-like limbs that stretch out from the trunk, it looks more 
like a standing corpse of a creature, and less like a mere dead

the weather allows, permitting entry into the spacious and neatly 
arranged interior.

a healthy cherry tree~
A healthy cherry tree grows here.~
   This tall, slender cherry tree has a dark, reddish trunk and a 
profusion of branches and dark-green leaves. It smells pleasant 
to most people. In spring, it brings forth profusions of pale 
pink flowers, and in summer, clusters of sweet, dark-red 
cherries. There are no cherries left that look pickable right 
now, however.

a sharp-edged, emerald-set dagger~
A sharp-edged dagger embedded with a green emerald lies here.~
   This sharp-edged dagger is well-made, and well-balanced. The 
blade extends only a few inches, and the end is curved up 
slightly. As it gets further from the hilt, the blade gets 
wider, giving it a slightly exotic look. A deep fuller runs down 
the middle of the blade. A thick, bronze pommel and crossguard 
end this dagger, the highly polished bronze seeming to contrast 
slightly with the brilliant green emerald that is embedded in the 
pommel. The handle is sturdy and has been wrapped in thick, 
black leather to offer a good grip to its wielder.

a flanged mace with a leather handle~
A brutal-looking mace is here, its handle wrapped in leather.~
   Forged to be sturdy and balanced, this mace is far from an 
elegant weapon, yet it looks to be extremely effective. Its 
flanges are honed to a razor sharp edge, ensuring that the mace 
penetrates hard metal, and allows the user the capacity of 
wrenching the armor free with a strong twist of the weapon. Its 
steel head and handle are both well tempered, while a strip of 
thick, black leather is wrapped around the grip. The weight of 
this mighty weapon ensures that only the strongest of users can 
use it effectively, if at all.

seen so much use that the soles are coming loose in a few places.
Whatever color the leather was once is obscured by a thick layer

an old, weathered houseboat~
A houseboat is moored here, a plank leading between it and the docks.~
   Long since sea-worthy, this houseboat has been permanently 
moored to the dockside by way of several ropes and a sturdy 
wooden plank. It bobs gently in the water, a narrow rim around 
the outside of the boat providing space to stand on and gaze out 
over the river. A railing keeps careless people from slipping 
off, its wooden boards about waist-height. The rest of the boat 
is a large building, one end open to the elements and customers. 
The stench of fish, fresh and old, wafts from it.

the arm-rests and tops of the benches.

a fine, steel-bladed bastard-sword~
A fine, steel-bladed bastard-sword lies here, glistening in the light.~
   This sword's blade is perhaps three and a half feet long, with 
a long hilt allowing room for a single or double-handed grip. 
The double-edged blade is made of a high quality steel, obviously 
forged by a masters hand, and has been sharpened to a razor edge. 
The blade meets the hilt of the sword at a darkened, steel 
crossguard, that extends out a few inches, then up to a sharpened 
point on each side. The handle has been wrapped in black 
leather, with small, thin strips of white leather encircling it 
to make for a better grip. The large steel pommel at the bottom 
of this sword gives just enough counter-weight to balance the 
blade perfectly, and has been inset with a single, small sapphire 
in its center.

allows the breastplate to be held in place, and a small iron 
buckle on each enabling adjustments to the size of the straps.

A pale yellow bundle of cloth lies here.~
   This small blanket is made of fine wool, and has been dyed a 
pale yellow hue. Stitches matching the color of the fabric run 
diagonally along the fabric, the lines several inches apart. 
Contrasting with the pale yellow of the fabric, an ornate dark 
black design runs along the border of the fabric, giving it an 
elegant look. In one corner, in the same color of black thread 
and neat stitches, a simple rocking horse design has been 
outlined. Its size would be appropriate for nothing larger than 
an infant. This item is well-made and warm.

seamless stitches joining the alternating patches of rough wool. 
The blanket itself seems warm enough to keep out the winter cold

Small holes within the material are meticulously sewn together.

An ornate, steel-bladed parrying dagger has been left here. ~
   This ornately designed dagger has been built from fine steel 
and bronze. Its blade, long and slender has been made from 
tempered steel, which has been polished and ends with a 
well-sharpened point. The crossguard, longer than most has been 
shaped so that it curves upwards acting like a hook to protect 
the wielder hands. Upon a closer inspection of the crossguard it 
seems to have been shaped into a dragon in mid-flight, with the 
crossguard acting as its wings. A wooden hilt wrapped in black 
leather cord joins the crossguard and blade with a well polished 
bronze pommel, which gives the dagger balance as well as some 
aesthetic beauty. A flame-like pattern has been etched into the 
dagger-blade, looking as if it was coming from the dragon's 
mouth.

wool sitting at the apex of the neckline. The lower skirt of the 
dress flows downwards, visible widening at the base, it seems as 
if it could have been made from the base of a cloak. The dress 
in general seems comfortable while also attractive and the sewing 
is of good quality.

A roughly made throwing knife lies here, its blade sharp.~
   This roughly made throwing knife is poorly made, having its 
blade chipped of stone. The blade widens slightly as it extends 
from the hilt, and is thick throughout to add weight. The handle 
is made of wood, wrapped in black leather and offers a good 
counterweight to the blade. Even though poorly made, the handle 
is easy to grip, and the blade still can cause great damage if 
used correctly.

A small throwing axe lies here, its blade gleaming.~
   This small, hand-held axe looks very much like it could be a 
hand axe, yet it's approximately half the size. It has a thick, 
wooden handle, and a broad sharp curved head. The head is 
significantly heavy, but the handle of the axe acts as a good 
counter weight, making this axe a great throwing weapon. Quite 
short in length, there is only room enough for one hand. The 
sharpness of the blade, as well as the shape of the head, marks 
it as a flesh cutting weapon and not a wood axe.

A sharp throwing dart lies here, its thin, blackened tip quite sharp.~
   This small throwing dart is made of a simple iron, giving it 
surprising weight for its size. A thin, needle like tip extends 
from one end that has been sharpened greatly, then continues 
back, expanding slightly the other way to allow for a good grip. 
Made entirely out of blackened iron, this dart is bare of any 
kind of wood or decoration that might impede its use. It is well 
balanced and good for throwing, yet its expanded back end allows 
it to be used as a good close quarter weapon when needed.

A long, slim wooden javelin lies here, forgotten.~
   This well-made wooden javelin is simple, yet well-balanced. 
Very light and slender, this long, slightly flexible spear is 
tapered to a sharp, foot long point. The spear tip extends 
straight out and has a tiny barb on one side in order to trap the 
weapon in its target. The wooden shaft has been wrapped in 
leather in certain parts to provide for a better grip, yet the 
middle has been left open for ease of use when throwing. 
Although designed in a way to be used in close combat, it is 
obvious that this weapon has been made specifically for throwing.

   This throwing hatchet is well made and it has good balance. A 
short haft of ash extends from the head, curving in slightly as 
it reaches the bottom. The handle itself has been wrapped in 
some dark brown leather to allow for a better grip. The head 
itself, a small, square blade with a pick back, is just heavy 
enough to offer a good counterweight to the handle, and allows 
this weapon to be good for throwing. However, its small size, 
and light weight also make it a good close quarters weapon when 
needed.

   This young, tabby kitten is always zipping about, sniffing in 
corners and hiding under furniture. His soft, short fur is 
marked by a mixture of grey and white stripes. A thin, little 
tail stretches straight out behind him as he prowls about. His 
right, front paw is covered with white fur, leaving him to look 
as if he's wearing a little white sock. With a healthy coat and 
stocky body, this kitten looks like he has been well fed and 
cared for. Two inquisitive green eyes study the surroundings and 
anything that moves.

Each stone has been carved in simple detail, the features and

An old, weathered pine armoire is here, secured to a wall.~
   This armoire might have once been a fine-looking piece of 
furniture but it would appear that neither the years or its 
previous owners have been very kind to it. Though the 
craftsmanship is quite good, this piece is certainly not in the 
best of shape. Probably acquired through some form of wholesale 
auction, it was certainly not purchased for its aesthetic appeal, 
but rather to provide some measure of storage for one's 
belongings. It stands on sturdy legs, and has been fastened to 
the wall with rather sturdy iron brackets.

the vines themselves twisting upward to support a brilliant star-cut
blue topaz that shimmers like pale water.

An elegant crossbow lies here, carved with a battle scene.~
   Crafted from one piece of cedar, this crossbow has has been 
articulately crafted. Its stock is thick, but since it was 
created from such a soft wood, it retains a lighter-than-normal 
feel. Carefully inlaid into the topside of the weapon is a 
smooth guide. Just behind it, a ruby-set catch has been laid 
around a metal rod, the gemstone pleasing to most eyes, and 
doubling as a rear sight. Across the front spans a slender piece 
of what looks to be yew. Its flexible ends are each attached to 
a corded length of greased horsehair, providing the power to fire 
bolts. Halfway down the bottom of the stock, a shiny brass 
trigger has been inset deep into the cedar, attaching through a 
series of mechanical linkage to the catch. On both sides of the 
weapon, an artful visage of battle has been carved, then the 
backing stained dark brown, allowing the gladiators to stand out. 
The whole crossbow is smoothed, and stained a light color.

a navy hoodie reading 'Ithaca College'~
A navy-blue hoodie lies neatly folded here.~
This hooded sweatshirt, more commonly known as a 'hoodie,' is
of masterful quality. It seems to be at least fairly old, though it
bears its age quite well. It is rather formless, draping over one's
body and clothing, leaving both the former and latter inconspicuous.
Stitched across the front in vibrant yellow letters are the words
"ITHACA COLLEGE" in capital letters. Beneath the words
is a generous pocket, bearing a hole on either side for both hands
to slide into.

   A long, stout piece of oak forms this weapon's shaft. The 
handle has been capped with shining iron plating, wrapped above 
with black leather above to provide a sturdy grip. A well 
crafted steel head sits atop the weapon, the metal obviously of 
stout make. The head itself is not too different than a typical 
hammer, though it is quite a bit larger, and obviously for a 
different use. The dual striking surfaces flair out from the 
each side of stout steel head, square in shape. Atop the weapon, 
a dirk like spike juts forth, running several inches.

and the arrangement of its teeth indicate that it most likely 
unlocks a rather complicated mechanism.

thrust at opponents. Each of the weapon's edges is sharpened and 
the wooden shaft is reinforced with iron bands to better 
withstand the charge of a mounted enemy. The White Tree of 
Gondor has been etched into the top most iron band.

The hilt is small in length, and is wrapped tightly in thick, black
leather, though at the top and bottom the leather has been dyed a

not new - marks mar the blade, and the leather is fraying slightly.

rusty. Mud and dirt are incrusted in some of the joints, while the
leather padding underneath is faded and patchy.

a horse, the other more like a file, for putting on a smoother point.
Each end works like a pick to clean the horse's hooves and either
clean under horseshoes or help remove them entirely.

allowing the cloakpin to be fastened to a garment or piece of 
fabric. The face of the coin has been engraved with the image of 
a pair of clasped hands.

An engraved bronze plaque is prominently displayed here.~
   This shield-shaped bronze plaque has been artfully engraved 
with a stylized coat-of-arms which depicts three vertical panels, 
the middle one being somewhat wider than the others. There is 
loose, clean diagonal hatching across the space of the outside 
panels, giving the suggestion of shading. In the middle panel is 
engraved a simple, iconic rendering of the Dome of Stars as seen 
from afar, with two hands clasped above it. Making up the border 
of the shield shape is a string of small, hexagonal-shaped coins.

   Made of a bright, heavy iron, this battleaxe sports two wide, 
crescent blades with skillfully crafted empty spaces between the 
handle and edge. The space lends the weapon a misleadingly 
fragile appearance, contrasted by the weight and expertly 
fashioned edge that indicate the painful capability of this 
weapon. The handle is carved out of thick oak with a long strip 
of leather wrapped tightly to it, securing a firm grip to 
properly wield the weapon. A short, sharp spike runs up from the 
top of the weapon, and a symbol of a white tree has been etched 
into the wood near the weapons head.

capped with a silver-plated sphere. The silver itself is also 
etched with a leaf and ivy pattern.

   The blade of this longsword is fashioned of thick steel, 
well-smelted and keenly sharpened at the edge. Twin steel 
quillions, wrapped with green leather strips, provide the user 
with a firm grip and protection. The blade is balanced by a 
large, spherical pommel of dull bronze. The metal of the pommel 
has been allowed to tarnish slightly, giving off a greenish tinge 
and minimizing the reflection of light. The blade of the sword 
itself is dulled by the effects of an oil, and absorbs light in a 
similar manner.

   This is a carved rendering of a chicken. While not shoddily 
done, it is far from being finely crafted. It has a few details, 
just enough to give it the appearance of a chicken. There is a 
smooth beak and there are a few embellishments on the back, 
giving the illusion of a few feathers. The chicken is on a small 
base, which allows it to stand, but it will fall over if bumped 
slightly. The chicken is made of fine maple wood and is about 
the size of the palm of your hand.

   It appears to be a poorly-crafted rendering of a cow. It is 
carved from maple, apparently chopped up a bit. It has the 
overall appearance of a cow, but under closer inspection it is 
questionable. The animal's head is the only detailed aspect of 
its body. It has two short stubs for horns and a mouth that 
seems to be smiling. It has big eyes and over-sized nostrils on 
its snout. Its body is somewhat pudgy and the tail is but a 
raised line on the back. One of the teets is missing on the 
udder. The cow is supported by a maple base, allowing it to 
stand on its own. The cow is large enough to be cupped in two 
hands and is somewhat rough to the touch.

   Inlaid with silver, this metallic weathervane is old and 
archaic looking, though it likely has some value. Ancient runic 
letters inscribed along its base lend to this, as do the etchings 
upon its foot-tall shaft. The weathervane itself is comprised of 
a silvery-metallic tree, an exaggeratedly long branch pointing in 
the direction of the wind when held upright.

A wrinkled, midnight-black leather mask lies here.~
   Roughly tanned leather dyed midnight-black has been used to 
create this well-crafted fiendish looking mask. The eyes are 
large hollows, backed in a bloodred fabric, thin enough so that 
the wearer may see out but none may see in. There are numerous 
wrinkles worked into the mask giving it a bereft expression, 
devoid of all happiness. The mouth is a thin slit, also backed 
in a thin piece of black fabric, set into a somewhat wicked yet 
mischevious smirk.

a jewel-encrusted crimson silk mask~
A mask of crimson silk, encrusted with jewels, rests here.~
   Obviously made by a fine craftsman and easily worth many 
coppers, this mask is the pinnacle of decadence and opulence. 
Made of crimson-red silk, it has been expertly molded and shaded 
to produce a visage permanently shaped into horror. An 
elongated, hooked nose, much like the prow of a ship, cuts down 
toward a sharply-angled, ferociously-agape mouth. The eyes are 
contoured into an arched shape expressing worry or fear. A hood 
has been wrought behind the mask, of pure shadowy-black silk with 
a tassled, hair-like amber fringe all around the edge. The most 
eye-catching feature, however, are the gems encrusted into the 
silk. Below the right eye, three progressively larger rubies 
trail like tears from its corner--the first as small as a child's 
thumbnail, and the last the size of a copper coin. Upon its brow 
have been encrusted four brilliant amethyst stones, providing 
stark contrast to the dark hues of the rest of the mask.

comfortable enough when worn against the delicate skin of a young 
child. A gentle, pale yellow dye has been used to color the

the hood. The stitching blends perfectly with the $finecolor 
fabric, and is seamless.

places, this small lexicon, upon closer inspection, is nothing 
more than a Numenian-Tengwar dictionary filled with numerous

filled with column upon column of neatly scribed Numenian-Tengwar 
sigils. The parchment pages are neatly bound inside the leather 
cover, the front and back binding boards securely glued in place. 
Upon much closer inspection you notice that the upper right-hand

a keen-edged, bone-white-bladed longsword~
A keen-edged longsword lies here, its blade bone-white and bright.~
   This longsword is of expert workmanship, and appears elvish in 
design. The blade is slender but solid, its keen edge honed to 
razor sharpness. The hilt is heavier but well-forged, engraved 
with runic patterns and elvish script and wrapped in supple 
leather to proffer the wielder a firmer grip. The pommel, an 
opal gripped in metal claws, is similarly decorated with runic 
designs. The blade of the sword itself is fashioned of a fine 
steel alloy, which appears bone-white in color. The tip is 
almost translucent, and the sword bears likeness to a shard of 
ice coating steel.

folded in a manner which would keep it shut.

down to the floor at the wearer's feet. Meticulously embroidered 
along the hem of the skirt, the ends of the elbow-length sleeves,

rose blossoms, occasionally flanked by a green embroidered leaf.

A simple, $color leather leg-quiver has been left here.~
   This flat, relatively small leather quiver has been curved to 
fit over the length of one's leg. Probably designed for the use 
of a horse archer, it'd be uncomfortable and awkward to don while 
walking, impairing movement. Fashioned of $color leather, the 
quiver is equipped with a series of leather straps and metal 
buckles, designed to be strapped securely over the wearer's shin, 
probably after a rider mounts his steed.

runs horizontally across the front of the helm. The edges of the 
helmet are adorned with stylized engravings, which add to its 
beauty.

wrapped with leather. At the base of the bronze pommel is a rough
area, a tiny blemish in casting; alongside this mark, two mountain
peaks have been carefully carved.

well-made, stylish, and snug-fitting, though it has seen its 
share of stains and rips, which appear to have been repaired by a 
novice.

flattened and so can be easily stood up on similarly flat 
objects. Light, wavy lines curve over the upper half of the body 
in which look like the creases of a supposed robe.

   Dyed a deep black and trimmed around the edges with a prestine 
white linen, this tabard is made of good quality cloth and has 
obviously been sewn by an experienced hand. The good wool of 
this tabard gives it a slight thickness which manages to not 
impede the user, yet still provides warmth when in cold or damp 
weather. Upon the chest of this tabard is an embroidered tree, 
fully done in white which makes it stand out greatly amongst the 
black of the cloth. The garment falls to the wearer's thighs, 
and is sleeveless. The only other outstanding feature is the 
large oval hole in the center which the wearer places their head 
through.

horse. It is in full stride, its powerful legs barely touching the wooden
base it is carved onto. Though the carving is not expertly made, much
attention has been paid to the details of the flowing mane and tail,
each looking very much like flowing hair. Its muscles are fairly
well-sculpted as it gallops. Its eyes peer into the distance, its
ears laid back to further suggest great speed. Some mistakes mar it
here and there, but overall, it is easily identifiable.

Her slender body, showing little sign of muscle, is slender and curvy.
Her outfit, composed of a halter top and skirt with slits up either side,
is encrusted with small gemstones, tiny real cabochons embedded into
the marble. A tiny anklet of filigree gold is set around her bare right
ankle, and a tiny golden heart pendant on an equally tiny chain dangles
around her shapely neck. Other than this, the figurine is entirely white
and smooth, the alabaster warm to the touch and well-carved.

A royal purple hooded cloak of fine wool and velvet lies on the ground here.~
   This billowing and voluminous cloak is fashioned mostly of 
finely-woven royal purple wool. Dark black velvet trims the 
edges of the cloak, giving it a genteel elegance. Gold silk 
tassles dangle along the front edges of the cloak, on top of the 
velvet lining, from the collar almost all of the way down to the 
bottom hem of the garment. The deep hood is lined with very soft 
brown rabbit fur, effectively keeping the wearer's head warm when 
drawn up.

   Four dull, quarter-inch spikes rise out of this hefty set of 
steel knuckles. The metal has been wrapped into a hollow oval, 
snug enough to fit around a man's knuckles. The short spikes 
were apparently attached after the original piece was forged. 
The marks where the two pieces were hammered together can barely 
be made out, dents in the polished surface.

Fashioned of deep, highly-polished rosewood, it is separated by a

the topmost circlet, twisting about the wood's length to meet the 
handle - a small knob of etched, silver-plated metal. Despite 
its slender size, the cane appears to be quite weighty.

   The burnished steel blade of this two-handed sword has been 
sharpened to a keen edge. A thick bronze crossguard has been 
securely attached just above the grip, providing ample protection 
for the hands. Supple leather is wrapped tightly around the 
hilt, allowing the wielder a sufficient hold. A large, round 
bronze pommel attached at the bottom adds extra balance, 
carefully etched with the White Tree of Gondor. This claymore is 
made heavier due to the lack of a fuller running down the blade; 
instead, a cross-section of the blade would appear more like an 
elongated diamond.

ankles of its wearer, and a long, deep hood is sewn into the back 
to offer further protection from the weather. A delicate flame 
pattern has been embroidered in bright red floss along the bottom 
edge as well as the side and hood edges. A bronze cloak clasp 
has been attatched at the neckline so it may be fastened about

a masterfully painted seascape in a rosewood frame~
A masterfully painted seascape in a rosewood frame has been perched on the wall here.~
   The subject of this painting appears to be a tumultuous 
seascape. Blue-green waves crash against one another, peaking 
left of center and curling over as they poise to engulf a 
battered sloop. Despite its apparently doomed circumstance, the 
boat seems just as likely to persevere, its tiny crewmen 
scattered over its main deck as they frantically busy themselves 
at various tasks common to a nautical emergency. Only one sailor 
faces the viewer: his forearms bulge beneath rolled-up sleeves 
soaked with sea water as he leans forward over the bow, frozen in 
the midst of a desperate attempt to scoop water off the deck and 
into the sea with an iron bucket. A signature in red paint, 
nestled in the lower right-hand corner of the piece and 
contrasting cleanly with the cool blues and greens that dominate 
the rest of the painting, reads 'Menahir' in Westron, in 
Numenian-Tengwar sigils.

   The fine weave of the linen fabric that composes this shirt 
gives it a texture almost like that of silk. A delicate floral 
pattern has been embroidered in metallic gold thread along the 
top front of the shirt, set against the even, sage green dye of 
the cloth. The sleeves of this garment are long and close with a 
single button at the cuffs. Unlike most shirts, however, the 
polished silver buttons are offset from the center, running 
downward from the right shoulder of the wearer. The stiff, 
standing collar of the garment has been carefully starched. The 
garment is not only stylish, but of superior craftsmanship.

fuller run downs its length, ending at a thick crossguard of

adornment, having indeed been slightly battered through continued 
use, save its unique bronze pommel which has been forged in the 
shape of a snarling wolf's head. Despite its weight, the sword

deeply blackened steel blade, a maple-wood hilt wrapped tightly in white
braided leather, and a sturdy bronze crossguard. It is well balanced,
with a fuller running a few inches from the tip to the hilt, keeping the
blade light. Deadly in the hands of a skilled user, a razor sharp edge
and needle point ensure its ability in combat. Its crossguard has the
White Tree of Gondor engraved on both sides, set deeply into the metal
and well-detailed.  The sword is exquisitely balanced, something immediately
obvious to anybody with a good eye for weapons. On the blade, near the
hilt, is an etching of a short, bearded figure holding an immense
battle-axe, a very small symbol. Made in the general style of a gladius,
it is meant more for thrusting than for slashing.

wielder's hands and a maple hilt has been painted black with a carving
of the White Tree of Gondor.  Around the White Tree are seven diamonds
representing the seven stars.  The longsword has been finely balanced with
a bronze pommel and it has langets set from the crossguard onto the

A masterfully wrought platinum ring, etched and set with large emeralds and sapphires lies here, flashing like a star fallen from the heavens.~
   This delicate band is made of brilliant platinum, a bit 
thicker along the top than the bottom in order to make room for 
the settings. There are three emeralds and three sapphires, the 
largest being three karats the smallest one karat in size. They 
are all teardrop cut, the largest ones side by side, making and 
oval that is half-emerald and half-sapphire, then spacing down
the ring to give the impression of emerald and sapphire drops 
pouring from the center and down the sides. All of the platinum 
surface has been etched, delicately, and filigreed with gold to 
lend the wave designs along its surface an eye-catching quality. 
It is a masterfully wrought bit of work, polished to a mirror 
sheen. Along the inside curve of the ring are a series of 
Sindarin sigils, illegible to any save those versed in the 
tongue. For those who can decipher the delicate lines, it is 
written 'My star-eyed beloved, let this ring keep you always as I 
would keep you, bright and unfaltering, held as the boughs hold
the wind, loved as the raindrop loves the rose petal. Keep this, 
my kiss upon your finger, until the end of our days.'

case UNIQUE_PAGASE pomander dented brass tarnished METAL~
a dented, tarnished-brass pomander case~
A dented, tarnished-brass ball strung on a length of faded cord lies here.~
   Bearing a large, visible dent, this pierced metal ball splits 
in half. A small hinge and latch hold the two separate pieces of 
tarnished brass together, forming a hollow case that is used to 
carry scented pomanders or dried herbs and fragrant spices. It 
hangs on a length of faded silk cord, allowing it to be worn 
about the bearer's neck or strung from a belt. It is clearly 
apparent this case has suffered through much use and neglect.

torso UNIQUE_PAGASE sculpted granite monument male STONE~
a sculpted granite torso~
A male torso, of sculpted granite, rests on top of a monument base.~
   Shaped from granite, it is the partial torso of a man, 
depicting only his head, neck and broad shoulders. His features 
are angular and strongly chiselled. Thick, curly locks of 
shoulder length hair have been sculpted with great detail and 
care by the sculptor. The man appears to be neither young nor 
old, his age impossible to determine from the sculpture itself. 
The subject's eyes are closed, as if the artist caught him 
sleeping and committed the peaceful, private moment to stone. 
The granite has been carefully worked by a modestly skilled hand. 
It appears to be the top portion of a two-part granite monument. 
Two small sigils, AV, serving as the sculptor's mark, have been 
carved into the back, lower right portion of the sculpture.

at one end and bearing a number of teeth arranged at the other.

A boar tusk sharpened into a knife lies here.~
   This severed boar's tusk has been fashioned to resemble a 
simple knife. It has been sharpened along its lower edge to 
reasonable keenness, and the blade is slightly hooked. Black 
leather has been wrapped around the lower portion of the tusk as 
a makeshift handle. It is a small, yet effective weapon.

   This small, crude sheath is intended for smaller weapons, such 
as daggers. Made of tanned boar hide, stiff and strong, is 
shaped into a sheath, with straps holding it onto an ankle. Best 
worn over a boot, it could be worn with ease over a bare ankle as 
well.

a slender, delicately-recurved scimitar~
A slender scimitar lies here, its blade delicately recurved and gleaming.~
   This scimitar is a thing of beauty and expert craftsmanship. 
Its slender blade is delicately recurved in shape and perilously 
sharp along its lower edge, designed to be used in swift, 
slashing strokes. There are two barbs in the blade to protect 
the wielders hand, one immediately above the hilt on the lower 
edge and the other about six inches further up, on the opposite 
side. Gold filigree has been beautifully inlaid into the handle, 
and an elegant flower detail has been engraved upon the length of 
the blade.

a long, steel-bladed scimitar~
A long, steel-bladed scimitar lies here, glinting.~
   The leading edge as well as a third of the trailing edge from 
the tip has been honed with razor-like precision sharpness. Made 
of steel, this swords blade will hold an edge sharper and for far 
longer than an iron blade would. The crossguard curves backward 
to cover the knuckles while the back curves up along the back of 
the blade. A bronze pommel is set onto the end of the handle to 
balance the blade properly. Strange wavy patterns can be seen 
along the length of the blade, evidence of its foreign crafter. 
Near the hilt of the blade is an etching of a short, bearded 
figure holding an immense battle-axe.

barding scrap-metal METAL~
a set of scrap-metal barding~
A set of scrap-metal barding lies here in a heap.~
   Made of thick leather, this barding covers the vital areas of 
a warg adeptly. Pieces of scrap metal, varying in size, shape 
and thickness, have been punched into the leather at spaced 
intervals. The metals scales only overlap near the haunches, 
however, and clatter noisily when the warg moves at anything 
quicker than a walk. What added protection the scrap-metal 
scales give to this barding, however, detract from the warg's 
overall mobility.

A plain pinewood table sits here.~
   Made out of sturdy pinewood, this table is designed for 
function over style. Four squared legs are set at each corner 
with a simplistic foot. The grain is sanded smooth and the edge 
is beveled with a rounded design. It looks sturdy enough to 
support a good deal of weight, but features no chairs for 
sitting.
