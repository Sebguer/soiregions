The Lower Rungs of a Siege Tower~
   A great mesh of wooden beams rise upwards here, its sides 
braced with steel bars, and draped with a web of rope ladders. 
The ground sits a good distance below, barely visible from behind 
the reinforced walls of the tower. Upwards, the many-runged 
ladder continues.

The Upper Lengths of a Siege Tower~
   The siege tower reaches the peak of its height here, the 
wooden beams opening upwards into a simple, square platform, only 
lightly defended. Ropes and chains hang from locked bars set at 
different intervals along the platform's walls. To the west, the 
grey stone of the Garrison's battlements can be seen, a single 
leap away from the tower's edge.

Opening of the Harador Bazaar Near the Gates~
   A broad square opens up to the north, west and south, filled 
with bustling crowds amidst pitched stalls and pavilions. To the 
east, a pair of tall, wooden gates lead out onto the streets of 
Morgul, open during the day and closed securely at night. Now 
and then, wagons and carts are driven through the gates both 
entering and exiting the Haradrim Quarter, as people move to 
clear a path for the vehicles.

Corner of the Harador Bazaar~
   The sounds of yelling and haggling echo across this large 
bazaar, no less diminished in this corner. The square opens up 
to the south and west, while the thick, stone wall of some large 
building stands to the north. Tar-covered, wooden logs that have 
been lashed together form the wall that encloses the Haradrim 
Quarter from the rest of the city, running north and south along 
the eastern perimeter of the marketplace.

The Harador Bazaar Between Some Tents~
   This narrow pathway passes in between many different tents, 
all of various shapes and sizes. Several small pegs stick out of 
the ground, with guide-lines attached to them, to keep people 
from setting up their tents too close to the path. One of the 
tents is a fiery shade of orange while the other is a pale shade 
of blue. The sounds of people chatting, haggling and yelling 
fill the air, as does the pungent aroma of sweat. The path 
continues on north and west through the bazaar, while some 
buildings line the perimeter to the south.

Center of the Harador Bazaar~
   This marketplace is the busiest part of the Haradrim Quarter, 
the sounds of haggling and bartering flooding the area, pierced 
by an occasional cry of a closed deal, or the loud announcement 
of a pickpocket. Tents and pavilions of loosely-woven cloth are 
pitched within close proximity of each other, their owners 
shouting out offers to all who pass by. The bazaar continues in 
all directions.

The Harador Bazaar Before a Tented Pavilion~
   A small pavilion has been set up here, with a tent over it to 
keep out the heat, and sometimes the rain. To the east, a narrow 
trail leads between several tents. Many people are walking 
through the bazaar, conducting their daily business. The sounds 
of people yelling, bartering with sellers, and occasionally 
screaming or yelling at others, can be heard all around, and a 
closer sound of men laughing and carrying on can be heard coming 
from a very busy and popular tavern to the west.

The Harador Bazaar Before a Small Warehouse~
   Just north of this area of the bazaar stands a large, 
sandstone warehouse. Large amounts of rocky gravel have been 
pummeled deep into the dirt here, making an even path. The air 
is quite hot, and a foul odor of sweating bodies and animal fur 
permeates freely. To the southeast is the opening of the Harador 
Bazaar, while to the north lies the warehouse. To the west is 
one of the many paths leading through the bazaar.

Western Edge of the Harador Bazaar~
   Many stalls and caravans have been scattered along the edges 
of this path. Their owners bustle from one customer to the next 
trying to sell off their wares. This part of the bazaar is in 
quite close proximity to the Haradrim Quarter, and some people in 
fine, religious robes can be seen walking in that direction. The 
air is very hot, and contains a foul odor of sweat and animal 
fur. Paths lead in all directions, heading off to other parts of 
the Harador Bazaar.

Corner of the Harador Bazaar Before a Few Storefronts~
   Sounds of people yelling and bartering bounce back and forth 
across the Harador Bazaar. The smells of dust and sweat are 
enough to choke those people that have not spent a lot of time 
here and grown used to it. A curtain separates this part of the 
bazaar from a small tattoo parlor to the north, while a sizeable 
pavilion stands to the west, heat wafting out through its tent 
flaps. The bazaar spreads out to the south and east.

The Harador Bazaar Before a Busy, Noisy Tavern~
   A large tavern has been built to the south of here, providing 
tired men with a place to sit down and relax among others. The 
sounds of those inside can be heard clearly, and while most of 
the time they are laughing and having a good time, the occasional 
yell and profanity can be heard. The bazaar continues to the 
north and east, where the sounds of people bartering and selling 
can be heard drifting across the area. To the east, a large 
tented pavilion has been set up. The doorway to the west has 
been covered by many long strings of beads.

Jirath Street Leading In and Out of the Harador Bazaar~
   The pale, yellow-stone cobbles of this street have seen much 
action in their time. People, caravans, and animals have all 
tramped upon these stones, scratching and eroding them over time. 
The sounds of trade fill the air from the Harador Bazaar to the 
east, spilling out onto the street. Small dwellings and shops 
have been built along the sides of the road, some more permanent 
than others. Jirath Street continues westward into the Haradrim 
Quarter, while to the east lies the Bazaar.

Rounding a Bend in Jirath Street~
   Jirath Street turns to the east and south here as it bends 
around some adobe-style shopfronts. Composed of rough, pale 
yellow stone cobbles, the surface of this road is somewhat uneven 
where bits of ground underneath show through. Citizens of the 
quarter and the occasional brigandine-clad guard move along 
through the city, stopping now and then as they go about their 
business. A large, smooth-walled building rises up a short 
distance to the south.

   A smoothly-paved pathway breaks off from the street and heads 
south, leading up to a set of curved, marble stairs that rise to 
meet a pair of massive doors set in the wall of the tribal 
council hall. The doors have been layered with dark leather, and 
riveted with huge metal studs. Growing from oversized planters, 
two curving, saw-leafed trees flank the doors and cast their 
shade over the stairs. Jirath Street continues westward, and 
around a bend to the north.

Jirath Street~
   Guardsmen, clad in brigandine and leather armor, move in and 
out of a large building to the south. The pale yellow cobble- 
stones of Jirath Street take a fairly even course east and west 
through the Haradrim Quarter, traveled by dark-skinned humans at 
most hours of the day. Some square, sandstone buildings are 
constructed to the north, separated by narrow alleyways. Lining 
the road to the south are a number of larger buildings, their 
walls smooth.

Intersection of Jirath and Abdali Street~
   The street bends here, both Jirath and Abdali gradually 
flowing into one another, Jirath continuing to the east while 
Abdali proceeds northward. The smooth cobblestone road is 
slippery, and almost hazardous in certain slick spots to travel 
upon. Soft, willowy steam is barely visible floating whimsically 
in thin wisps from the northwest. The strong scent of animals 
drifts across the air to the south, coming from a large stables 
complex in that direction.

Abdali Street East of a Large Bathhouse~
   The street continues here in a north-south fashion, never 
deviating from its course with unneccessary circuitous 
meanderings or other such imperfections. The street is rigidly 
straight, forming an almost grid-like pattern with surrounding 
buildings and other roads. A quite impressive, and substantially 
enormous building looms westward, its rough yet finely polished 
sandstone exterior glistening dully. A remarkably prominent dome 
protrudes from the flat, plateau of the roof of this building, 
glittering with an ornate configuration of stained-glass.

   The street here is arrow-straight, continuing to the north and 
south in a perfectly linear fashion. The smooth, yet uneven 
cobblestone road bears the marks and signs of the toil of long 
years of numerous footfalls. A quite massive sandstone building 
lies to the west, and continues to the southwest. Long, willowy 
wisps of moist steam radiate from the openings of the building, 
and an enormous, architecturally-magnificent dome decorates the 
top of the building, incorporating a mixture of sandstone and 
radiant, mutli-coloured stained glass windows. A squat, 
sandstone building stands to the east.

   The road narrows here, buildings pressing in on either side as 
it enters the housing district to the north and east. A dusty, 
beaten pathway breaks off to the east, winding deeper into the 
rows of houses, a mixture of sandstone abodes and semi-permanent 
dwellings of wood and cloth. Loosely-garbed Haradrim move along 
the street, going about their business. Abdali Street continues 
southward, widening slightly as it goes on.

small, stone well, frequented by a few women and children 
throughout the day. Dusty paths lead off in all cardinal

The Galenas Pipe~
   This wood-walled room is small, but arranged to maximize what 
space is available. The air is thick with the heady, exotic 
smell of various types of incense and pipe-weed, and the sources 
of those scents have been arrayed neatly on small tables and 
racks against the north and south wall. An ornately patterned 
red and black carpet has been centered on the floor, leading from 
the door to the counter in the back of the room. Dim lighting is 
provided by several fat, round red candles that are set in 
various locations throughout the room.

A Small, Dirt-Floor Tattoo Booth~
   This cramped room is lit dimly by torches set in rusting metal 
holders, which are bolted to the shoddy, wood-plank walls. A 
fraying, dark blue woolen rug partially hides the dirt floor, and 
a multitude of small clay pots and needles are arrayed within a 
set of shelves built into the back wall. A table stands in the 
very center of the booth, covered with a stained, off-white linen 
cloth. Beside it is a rickety wooden chair.

table stained~
   This nicked and scarred wooden table has surely seen better 
days, but looks sturdy enough. It is covered with an off-white 
linen cloth which bears many suspect-looking rusty-red stains, as
well as various splotches of faded dye.

Blades of Harnen~
   Decorated from floor to ceiling in exotic, 
garishly-contrasting colours, the walls of stone are buried 
beneath multiple layers of fresh paint and newly-hung tapestries. 
The counter is, without a doubt, the only unpainted furnishing in 
this room; it is, however, etched with numerous swirls and whorls 
upon its surface, giving it ample decoration. All about the room 
are racks, shelves, and hangers, upon which rest fine weaponry of 
every sort, though scimitars and spears seem to be prevalent. 
   A door to the south bars passage into the private recesses of 
the building, while the door to the north opens back upon the dim 
path of Malle Abattarik.

Minas Morgul Pawning and Trade Goods~
   Counters and shelves line all four walls of this small store. 
An old wooden sign hanging above one of the shelves announces the 
name of the store. Several small tables have also been set up in 
the middle of the room. The counters, shelves, and tables are 
all littered with various objects for sale. Some of them don't 
appear to be worth very much, but some of them look like they 
might be rather valuable, and most of these valuable items are 
locked in glass display cases. Long strings of beads cover the 
doorway to the east, which leads back out to the Bazaar.

Tavern of Biko al'Hajjaj~
   The center of this tavern is dominated by a sunken grill 
filled with smouldering coals and ringed with stones. Sizzling 
meats, vegetables, and cauldrons of stew cook over the firepit, 
filling the room with a warm, spicy aroma. Large pieces of 
leather cured to various shades of tan and brown have been nailed 
to the walls, not only giving them the appearance of tent sides, 
but acting as both a buffer to the noise in the establishment and 
a crude form of insulation. Overhead, the rafters are draped 
with billowing lengths of fabric of a sandy-brown hue. Scattered 
over the earthen floor are thick, wildly patterned rugs and 
tasseled cushions, and while few tables grace the tavern, a row 
of low, flat-topped chests act as both storage for cheeses and 
wines and furniture to eat at for those who prefer such amneties. 
The occasional loud barks of laughter and strings of curses 
punctuate the constant drone of conversation.

Golden Arms Trading Company~
   This storefront is built in a fairly simple and straight 
forward fashion, as far as Haradrim construction is concerned. 
The windows have faded purple cloth to cover them during the 
night, with thin panes of red glass hidden behind them. The 
floor is made out of solid, even cherry planking, and the walls 
from a form of red brick sandstone.

A Flamboyantly-Decorated Dining Hall~
   Clearly of fairly recent build, this place has the smell of 
new cherry wood and cooking food hanging about it. In one corner 
of the room is what looks to be a makeshift kitchen, thrown 
together by whoever owns this building. Aside from that, this 
room is lined by tables, at which as many as twenty people could 
gather comfortably. There is a series of carpets that cover the 
floor in one corner of the room; they are likely for guests to 
sit upon.

A Small, Sandstone-Walled Barracks~
   An odd and disorderly procession of bunks and mattresses have 
been tossed about this room making it resemble a flophouse more 
clearly then a barracks. The Sandstone walls of the building 
have numerous holes bored and punched into them for some unknown 
purpose or accident. A few hooks also hang from the ceiling at 
uneven intervals sporting different sorts of Harad made spears.

   This room is a fairly large expanse with various crates and 
objects lying around for preparation to sell. The floor is made 
out of stout Birchwood planking and the walls continue the odd, 
sandstone motif. A ragged, half-done banner of a serpent hangs 
in one corner, clearly completed some long time ago and hung here 
thoughtlessly.

   This office is fairly clean for having been inhabited by 
Haradrim, almost unused. A desk sits in one corner with a thin 
layer of dust on top of it. The offices walls are bare and 
empty, wood planks fortifying the sandstone bricking present in 
the rest of the building with the exception of one window to the 
north which overlooks the busy Harador Bazaar.

   Little more then a small open room this workshop contains a 
various smattering of tools and empty space for work. The walls 
are simple, plain and non-descript allowing the crafter to focus 
entirely on their work. The floor here is scuffed in many 
places, large indents into the Birchwood planking where heavy 
objects have been dropped and gouged holes into the floor.

The Warp and Weft of the Reflected Moon~
   A gigantic loom towers in the far rear corner of this stone 
building, a menagerie of colourful threads woven within it, not 
quite to the point of a finished product yet. A few well-crafted 
wooden tables display a profound plethora of fine garments. A 
wide range of exotic and unusual colours line the tables, all 
masterfully created with meticulous hands. The calibre of garb, 
furniture and the components of the building itself insinuate 
that this is quite a respectable establishment within the 
clothing market. A sturdy mahogany door, draped with a curtain 
of intricately woven blue and yellow threads provides access to 
another room in the building; rugs decorating the rest of the 
wall. Dyes, bolts and threads are stacked, but not in great 
amounts.

Gems of the East~
   Two wooden cases line either wall of this building, reaching 
about waist-height before opening up to display, through a 
protective glass pane, their treasures. Ethereally beautiful 
gems and precious stones lie within the cases, some bound within 
rings, necklaces and other jewelry, and others stand alone and 
magnificent. The floor is concealed by a rich, bright carpet, a 
variation of colours interwoven into its fine threads. The rough 
stone walls are decorated with various small cases, each one 
portraying some uniquely ornate and priceless jewel, and each 
locked very securely.

The Entrance to the Council Hall~
   Just by looking at the entrance, it is apparent that this 
building took a lot of time and money to construct, as well as 
maintain. The floor of this entrance hall is made entirely of 
dark marble. At the center of the floor, the marble is somewhat 
lighter and forms a large symbol. The marble has been carefully 
polished, and reflects everything in the hall. A pair of 
metal-bound great doors set in the northern wall provide entrance 
and exit, while doors set in every other wall lead off into 
different rooms.

A Disorganized Barracks with Trophies on the Walls~
   This room appears to be an army barracks. Several small 
benches have and tables have been set up here. Several different 
types of weapons lay on the tables and leaning against the walls. 
Many trophies hang on the walls and set on the tables of the 
room, which includes everything from large animal heads to small 
plaques, and what appears to be a gruesome human head in one dark 
corner. There is an exit to the east, and a large wooden door to 
the south.

A Dark, Somewhat Dusty Armory~
   There are no windows in this small room, and very little light 
comes from the doorway to the north. A few long tables have been 
set up and pushed against the walls of the room. Many different 
types of armor litter the room, and have been somewhat organized. 
However, most of it looks as if it's been there for a while, 
since most of the items have been covered in a thin layer of 
dust. There are several dented and battle-worn helmets on the 
tables, and many pieces of chain-mail hang on the walls and lay 
across tables.

   This room is even grander than the entrance hall to the north. 
It has also been made of the same marble that was used to make 
the entrance hall, with dark marble for the floor and blue marble 
for the walls. A large rectangular table has been placed in the 
middle of the room. The table is made entirely of oak, and has 
been polished so well it shines. Fifteen magnificent wooden 
chairs have been set up around the table, with the largest one at 
the head of the table. Many different paintings of various 
battle scenes have been hung on the blue marble walls, each with 
their own label of what the battle was and when it was fought. 
Expensive metal swords and shields have been hung decoratively on 
the walls, and helmets have been set on small tables in the 
corners of the room.

recently. A large oak table has been set up in the corner of the 
room, with a chair sitting behind it, facing the western exit. 
Several books and pieces of parchment are scattered across the 
table. In the other three corners of the room, large potted 
plants are set on small wooden end tables, their exotic shapes 
lending an air of foreignness to the room.

The Grandly Decorated Bed Chamber for the Head of the Council~
   This chamber provides a home for the grand head of the 
council. The walls are made of an ornately carved marble, while 
the floors are of an expensive hardwood variety. Great care has 
gone into crafting the marble walls and the floor. Various 
paintings are hung on the wall, each with a gold label beneath. 
A lush bed lies in the south-eastern corner, covered by a 
ceremonial quilt, and some large pillows. The walls periodically 
sport heavy iron torch stands, which house each a torch burning 
bright. To the north lies the exit to this chamber augmented by 
a heavy, well-kept door.

There's a counter here for the shopkeep to work, while benches on 
either side of the room allow for slaves to sit quietly until 
called away to do the bidding of those that seek out heavy 
laborers able to carry or smash stone.

   The sounds and smells that exist in a typical stable complex 
certainly exist in this one as well. The sounds of the animals 
being kept here can be heard from all directions. The musty 
smell can make those who are not accustomed to such smells choke 
and gag. The smell is so bad it can almost be tasted. Hay 
covers the dirt floors of the stalls to both the east and the 
west. A supply hall is to the south, and two animal pens branch 
off from it.

sizes, apparently for more than just horses. Large barrels of

The Entry Hall to a Large Bathhouse~
   The large square room of the bathhouse entrance is carefully 
tiled with mosaics depicting birds of Western origin flying on 
either side of a splaying tree that broadens as it meets the 
eastern double-doors. A large dark red curtain blocks passage to 
the west, behind which steam presses into this room and leaves 
condensation across every stone surface. Counters and small 
shallow pools surround a central booth within which the bathhouse 
servants ensure visitors have towels, soap and luxuries. The air 
hangs heavy, hot and extremely humid, until the doors open, at 
which point a freezing chill tends to gust into the room at all 
times of years; to try and combat this, thick strips of curtain 
hang directly inside the entrance and need to be pushed aside. 
The sound of flowing water mixes with the background roar of 
fires and cracking coals. Further access is presumably granted 
through approaching the servants.

A Large, Public Bath Chamber~
   This is the central room of this bathhouse. The tiled floor 
glistens with a wet sheen, as steam condensates upon touching the 
floor. The air is very humid and hot. Many figures, some robed, 
some naked, sit on the benches and floor soaking up the 
atmosphere. To the east lies the entrance to the bathhouse, 
while both the north and south doorways sport curtains which lead 
to other rooms.

A Warm, Private Bath Chamber~
   The air inside this private bath chamber is very warm and 
moist. It has apparently been made for people with high status 
in the world. A towel rack with golden rods has been set up, 
with several large, soft towels draped across them. Long benches 
made of soft white marble have been set here for people to sit 
on. The door to the south leads into the main bath chamber.

A Warm, Private Bath Chamber~
  This room is a very posh one.  Well-crafted marble benches,
and a gold towel rack have been placed here, along with a
bunch of soft towels.  This room is for the politicians and
heros of the city.  The floor is tiled, with absolutely no
scratches or dirt anywhere.  The air is very warm and humid, 
but some cooler air is coming in through a grating on the
eastern wall.

A Luxurious, Bath Attendants Bedchamber~
   This bedchamber is the quintessence of wordly pleasure. Rich, 
luxurious carpets stretch out along the floor, a myriad of 
dazzling and brilliant colours, and extremely soft and delicate 
to the touch. Several large couches and other cushions lie about 
the room, each constructed of elegant and exquisite exotic 
fabrics. The steam from the bath chamber creates a fine, moist 
atmosphere here, and the very room reeks of corrupt decadent 
pleasure.

A Luxurious, Bath Attendants Bedchamber~
   A quintessential example of corruption and decadence, this 
room seems to be the romping grounds for both of these sinful 
evils. Rich, luxurious carpets and mats lie strewn about the 
room, obviously employed in many guilty pleasures. The air here 
is moist and warm, a perfect mixture for the seductive mood that 
is so omnipresent within this place. Smooth silk sheets lie 
crumpled along the primary bed mat, and the entire room's 
plethora of wild colour dazzles the eye.

A Brightly Decorated Room Smelling Of Leather~
   This room is spacious and airy, with several windows facing 
the busy pedestrian traffic of Abdali Street. The windows are 
curtained with colorfully beaded fabric, and the doorway is 
curtained with strings of round beads, the glass chinking and 
chiming noisily whenever anyone brushes through. The walls are 
painted an unusually plain, fresh white for Haradrim decor, but 
it serves to add a sense of openness to the room. The lack of 
color in the paint is made up for with the several wall hangings 
that decorate the spaces behind wooden shoe and boot racks, the 
latter of which line the entire shop in neat aisles. A broad, 
light-colored oak counter spreads across the back of the shop.

Inside the Gates of the Black Numenorean Quarter~
   Flat, neatly cobbled stones ground under the passage of many 
armored boots line the passage from the east to the west. A 
large, guarded gate stands to the west, an obstruction between 
the Black Numenorean Quarter where law is strictly enforced, and 
the sea of chaos that makes up the rest of the city. The gate 
itself, made of thick bronze bars, is built into an old stone 
fence and shows clear effort to reinforce it and build it higher 
then it had once been originally from the varying colors of brick 
lining its length.

Dun Arath Leading Into the Black Numenorean Community~
   The road stretches out to the west and east, between the gate 
and deeper into the Black Numenorean Quarter. The road itself is 
heavily patrolled by numerous soldiers serving the Black Watch 
and orcs or even Haradrim are an odd sight on this part of the 
street. Its surface is well-maintained and neatly paved; clear 
and considerable effort has been put into preventing the trash 
that seems to clutter the rest of the city from residing here. A 
grand old building fashioned of marble borders the southern edge 
of the road.

Morgul Coinworks and Usury~
   Fairly busy, this shop is highly guarded and watched on both 
inside and out as large amounts of money tend to make their way 
through the doors in trade every day. The shop itself is built 
rather plainly out of pine wood walls. Towards the rear of this 
shop is a vault with a heavy, locked door guarding the passage 
inward. Generally this shop attracts a good number of both Black 
Numenoreans and Haradrim, and is the center for the exchange of 
currency, loans, and the purchasing of real estate in the two 
quarters.

ranking planks until they are covered by a red carpet near the 
back of the store. A counter stands with a glass panel in front 
of it displaying the various types of weaponry that are available 
for sale here. The walls themselves are lined with hooks, upon 
which hang pole-arms of various shapes as well as a rare 
two-handed sword or spear. While not overly large this shop 
contains plenty of room for several people to gather here and 
browse without the place feeling overly crowded.

Dun Arath Passing By Shopfronts~
   The Dun Arath Way passes along several shops lining the road 
to the north, a tall stone wall to the south closing off this 
quarter from the rest of the city. Organized to a fault, the 
shops seem to be almost identical in a militaristic fashion 
except for the signs that hang in front of their doors. This 
street's surface is neatly paved and well-maintained, kept clear 
of litter and debris as it cuts east and west between the 
buildings.

Dun Arath at the Crossing of Garan Del~
   The path comes to an intersection here where traffic 
interchanges between Dun Arath to the west and Garan Del leading 
deeper into the Black Numenorean Quarter. A well has been 
constructed here in the middle of this plaza, oddly enough 
bearing one of the few, unpolluted sources of water in the city 
of Minas Morgul. The guards standing here seem to watch wearily 
however, hands never leaving their weapons breaking the illusion 
of this junction being a simple, peaceful gathering place.

   A musty smoke tinged with the smell of oil hangs around this 
small shop. Someone has taken clear intent to ensure that as 
much of the furniture as possible is hewn out of stone, and it is 
clear that the chandler who runs this shop was quite worried 
about the place setting ablaze. Numerous barrels are stacked in 
the corner by a table as well as half finished lanterns and a 
large bundle of torches, both finished and unfinished.

Garan Del Leading Through a Row of Identical Houses~
   Rows of houses line the street of this small residential 
district making it clear that few civilian Black Numenoreans 
actually make their residence in Minas Morgul. One of the most 
surprising details about the layout of the houses is their 
uniformity. The houses all seem to be built into a cube-like 
shape out of solid wood planking. The roofs of the houses are 
made out of red tiles layered over thin planks of sheet-wood to 
keep the rain out while making sure the roof doesn't rot away.

numerous objects constructed out of bronze that line the walls. 
In one corner three mannequins stand dressed in varying forms of 
bronze plate, the Black Numenoreans' preferred armor. Helmets 
line the walls and shelves, many of odd and unusual shapes with a 
somewhat strange decorum to them. The shops walls are made 
sturdy out of wood planking nailed together with an occasional, 
heavy brass spike.

A Small, Sturdy House~
   Wood framed walls surround the confines of this simple, one 
room house. A bed sits pushed aside into one corner, while 
cabinets line a sort of makeshift kitchen. Solid, wooden 
planking raises the floor of this house from the dirt while at 
the center it is covered in a slightly bedraggled, red carpet. 
Two windows face outside so that the owner of this house may get 
a view of the street outside. Simple in design, this home bares 
little of the clutter or embellishments that seem to plague the 
rest of this city, it stands as a stone of stability, an 
unchanging brick in the swirling chaos of Minas Morgul.

Garan Del Leading through a Row of Identical Houses~
   The street here sees little traffic most hours of the day and 
night, only the occasional resident or troop of Black Numenorean 
soldiers moving across its dark-cobbled surface. The houses 
lining either side of the road are strictly uniform in 
construction, built from solid wooden planks and red tiling. A 
few narrow alleys lie between buildings to the east, while a 
larger structure takes up a sizeable portion of the district to 
the northeast.

A Humble, Well-Built House~
   Sturdy walls rise to just above the average height of a man in 
this carefully built, squarish home. The general furnishings of 
this house are fairly modest, a table sits in one corner with a 
large padded chair beside it, a bed in the other corner with a 
few shelves hanging above it. What is perhaps the only odd 
furnishing of this small home is a strange depiction of the stars 
made out of wire and sheet metal that cast odd, and eerie 
reflections about the room at night. Occasionally the deadened 
trees behind the house scrape their skeletal fingers against the 
outer walls making it sound like someone, or something was trying 
to gain access to this home.

A Narrow, but Solid House~
   Though the thin walls cramp and confine the over all layout of 
this room, the owner has still found a way to fit in a fair 
amount of furniture and effects without making it to cramped to 
move. A round table with a few chairs takes up the center of the 
room, while a storage pantry for food lies against one of the 
walls. A cot sits as out of the way as possible, likely being 
the place where the owner of this house sleeps. A slight chill 
occasionally breeches this room from some unseen gap in the wall 
and keeps the temperature quite cool.

   The entrance to a popular inn stands to the east side of Garan 
Del. A sign in front of the door is carved like a hanging mug, 
and quite a few travelers from the dark lands of Mordor enter 
this building looking to take a load off and relax from the long 
journey. Yet, during the day the inn is fairly quiet the only 
noise to be heard the slight creaking of the sign in the wind.

A Fairly Large, Common Room~
   This large room is often frequented by Black Numenorean and 
Haradrim travelers and is perhaps the most commonly frequented 
inn throughout the whole city of Minas Morgul. A thin haze of 
smoke seems to cling to the room in wisps as well as in smell as 
the poorly lit atmosphere commonly uses wall torches in the 
night. While the inn is not dangerous per-say, it is not a 
wholesome environment either as large groups of unsortly types 
and toughs seem to congregate here in part of their search for 
wealth. The patrons are all kept in check, however by the 
intimidating presence of the Black Watch, Minas Morgul's elite 
soldiery.

men to stand comfortably. Atop some of the shelves lay some 
dirty pots and pans while residing in the corner racks are some 
bottles of herbs and spices. A fireplace with a small spit has 
been build into the western wall. Smoke rises from it into the 
chimney to be expelled to the outside.

roof is quite bare, made of the same hardwood, and virtually 
design-less. The hallway continues to the south, with a door

any of the furniture, walls, or floor.  The walls are covered
with a thick padding, keeping much of the heat in the room.  The
floor is covered by a massive green carpet, very lush and fuzzy.
Each of the walls sports one double torch stand, bolted firmly in
place.  The roof is made of a very well crafted hardwood.  A
chandelier can be seen hanging from the roof, sporting four candles
amongst the carefully made brass.  A large bed and dresser can be
seen lining the southern wall, while a small fireplace and chimney
have been placed along the eastern. Besides the doorway out, the
northern wall sports a pair of small drawings.

provide much illumination to the hallway, enough to be able to 
pick out blots of varnish that has been worn off. The floors are 
quite similar to the walls. Uncarpeted, uncarved, but very 
sturdy. A heavy door has been placed in conjunction with the 
doorframe to the east, while the hallway continues north.

and south. The grey, brick building to the west seems to loom 
over the street, its staircase leading up to a granite overhang 
held up by chiseled, marble pillars. Its architectural design 
seems out of place here, hearkening to a more classical era than 
the series of identical buildings that populate the rest of this 
quarter. Guards stand at their posts on either side of the 
iron-banded door, keeping a constant eye on those moving by.

here, as a path of dusty, reddish dirt leads eastward along the

north, is made of thick black stone and marks the northern 
boundary of the city. The dark silhouettes of guards can be seen 
pacing along its battlements high above.

   Traveling parallel to the city's inner wall north of here, the 
Meras Anim streetway cuts across an area where the road had not

as if attempting to escape the befouled ground they had been 
planted on. The road runs east towards a large estate, while 
small houses line its southern edge.

Meras Anim Before a Large Estate~
   The dirt road comes to an end here, where the eastern and 
northern walls of Minas Morgul meet at a right angle. Westward, 
the pathway leads out into the rest of the Black Numenorean 
Quarter, skirting the edges of wooden houses and stone buildings. 
To the south, a half-circle of marble tiles lie in front of a set 
of elaborately wrought, bronze gates that provide entrance to a 
large estate. Glimpses of a lush, green garden can be seen 
between the thick, solid bronze bars of the gates.

   Traveling parallel to the city's inner wall north of here, the 
Meras Anim streetway cuts across an area where the road had not 
yet had time to be completed. Small, weed like plants reach up 
between sparse cobbles choking to death in the deadened, red soil 
as if attempting to escape the befouled ground they had been 
planted on. The road runs east towards a large estate, while 
small houses line its southern edge.

Garan Del Near a Busy Crossroad~
   The Garan Del roadway stretches out to the north here, fenced 
off by the walls of buildings around it. Recently built, wooden 
houses line the road to the west almost as if they were a line of 
individual barracks. To the south, the road meets with Dun Arath 
by a few scattered shops. Patrols of Black Watch guardsmen are 
often seen patrolling the area keeping tight order on the place.

The Black Watch Guardhouse Foyer~
   Gray brick walls surround this large gathering place and send 
a clear message out of security. A heavy door blocks travel to 
the east, banded with iron and reinforced the door has a heavy 
bar placed across its length to make it hold up against a fair 
share of battering if necessary. Doors also block the other 
exits to this hallway, but they are not nearly so fortified. 
Large banners hang from the walls showing a gauntlet gripping a 
lightning bolt surrounded by a field of black. A few tables have 
been left in this hall in an organized fashion far away from the 
south door.

At a Dark Stairway~
   A stone walls close in around this circular stair well 
descending deep into the depths of the Blackwatch guardhouse. A 
pair of torches are the only thing to keep this windowless, 
shadowy coffin of a room lit. The torches themselves cast 
haunting light about the occupants of this room making their 
shadows dance upon the walls and grow to epic proportions. The 
slightest movement in this room seems to cause a heavy echo, the 
staircase ringing a hollow note each time it is stepped upon as 
if some giant being were passing through.

A Spacious, Stark Barracks~
   Rows of neatly lined wooden bunks stand in perfect file and 
order in this room, the ceiling being nearly twice the height of 
the average man to accommodate them and leave room to spare. 
This barracks is neat and orderly, cabinets for supplies sitting 
in one corner while footlockers line each bunk bed, shaded in 
differing colors. The cool, gray stone walls of this room are 
bare and nearly undecorated. The chamber itself is large and 
spacious, and with its lack of furniture and decorum it could 
likely hold near to a hundred people at once if necessary, making 
the place feel even more empty with its current lack of filled 
space.

   Bland, identically crafted tables line this room taking up 
nearly the whole space enclosed within. Noise seems to echo 
about this room and rebound including the voices and mutterings 
of numerous of duty members of the Black Watch. The room itself, 
while easily large enough to hold fifty men contains little to no 
sign of decoration or embellishment aside from the banners lining 
the walls displaying a mailed fist clutching a lightning bolt.

very little built up grime and filthiness. Wooden shelves line 
the western wall while a large and sanded down countertop with 
various containers for various cooking utensils sitting atop. 
Along most of the southern wall a large wood stove with a long 
climbing cylindrical chimney for the smoke. A safe distance away 
from the stove is a neatly stacked pile of wood used for heating 
the stove for cooking.

   This spacious, wood walled office has a somewhat relaxed look 
about it. The northern half of this room has been converted into 
a sleeping area. A fireplace sits in one corner of this room
meant to keep it heated at all times of day. Above the fireplace 
hangs a massive, two handed-sword carved of solid ivory. A heavy 
mahogany desk stands towards the center of the room set high to
create it as an intimidating seat of power. A single window 
stands against the west wall, barred in iron to prevent a 
potential break-in, while still allowing a fair amount of light
to breach this chamber.

A Small, Weathered Courtyard~
   The ground here, in this modestly sized, inner city courtyard, 
has been paved extensively with some kind of high-quality 
cobblestone, however, the passing of some time since its 
construction is strongly evidenced in the tarnished, weathered 
appearance they have taken on. The courtyard is walled with 
welded iron spikes, approximately four inches apart and eight 
feet high, creating a bounds for the area without obscuring a 
great deal of vision, into or out of the area. A pergola of old 
wood has been erected, as heavily weathered as any other part of 
this area, and many climbing vines can be observed intertwined 
about its supports. The main house of the property, two storeys 
high, looms to the south, with a smaller building to the west, 
both with roofs of tile. A thatched-roof building to the east 
appears to be some kind of stable.

A Somewhat Messy, Cramped House~
   Junk, trash and clutter is piled high in this room around 
stacked and broken furniture. A general smell of body odor has 
begun to settle over this place, the lack of windows doing little 
to help in its escape. The wood-planked floor is scuffed and 
gouged by various heavy objects being drug over it and dropped. 
A archaic cabinet stands against the wall, while a tacky, 
oversized bunk bed takes up much of the rest of the room. A 
table has been thrown against the north wall, almost as if it 
were barricading the house from some unseen evil that could 
travel through the houses solid, pine walls.

An Empty, Cube Shaped House Covered in a Thin Layer of Dust~
   Dust has begun to settle upon the floor of this long, 
unoccupied home. Cob webs gather about in the wood rafters just 
beyond reach of the average man. This empty house is entirely 
cube shaped with no detail-work at all. Heavy, wood walls seem 
to suggest that this place would be habitable once again should 
someone take out the time to clean it and prepare it for a new 
guest. What is more disconcerting however, is that someone had 
taken the time to scribe the words 'help me' upon the eastern 
wall of this home, although the reason remains unclear.

A Well-Guarded, Lush Courtyard~
   This fairly large courtyard leads on a path towards a 
well-built stone estate. Although few things grow in this city, 
plant-life thrives here, clearly carefully tended, and neatly cut 
hedges line the winding gravel pathway. A guardhouse sits to the 
west, bearing a pair of arrow slits in its outer wall that point 
into the courtyard, making it a safe assumption that anyone 
entering this place is carefully watched. Polished marble steps 
lead up to an ancient, ornately carved door leading into the 
estate building itself. The whole area looks to be of fairly new 
construction, and bears few of the signs of wear and tear common 
throughout the otherwise run-down parts of Minas Morgul.

A Small, Enclosed Guardhouse~
   This small stone guardhouse has been built right into the 
estate's wall, providing a bit of comfort to off-duty guards. A 
cozy flame is kept perpetually burning in the blackened 
fireplace, over which hangs an iron kettle used for stews. The 
fire's light plays upon the rough stone floor of the cottage, 
much like a faerie's dance. Bits of armor lie strewn about, 
apparently cast off by weary guards. The only way out of the 
guardhouse is a rather utilitarian wooden door.

   Broad and spacious, this white marble-floored entry hall 
extends for quite some distance beyond the entryway. The center 
of this hall is lined with a red carpet which runs toward the 
base of some stairs visible at the end of the hall. The walls 
are lined with banners bearing a solid gauntlet crushing a 
lightning bolt in a field of black. Two mannequins have been 
constructed here, garishly armed in shining suits of bronze plate 
so meticulously polished that they are nearly damaging to the 
eye. A somewhat plain door stands just to the west, while 
eastward a wood-framed door stylized with crystal panes allows 
view into a spacious dining hall.

wood, and have been sanded smooth. A polished brass lantern 
hangs from the ceiling, casting its warm light over the area. To 
the east is a plain wooden door, and to the south, a slightly 
dusty red curtain blocks view into a chamber beyond. A heavy, 
solid-looking trapdoor is set into the floor in the northwestern 
corner of the room.

   A beautiful chandelier that is composed of of multi-colored, 
finely-wrought glassworks and likely worth a small fortune is 
suspended over this fine and spacious dining hall. Carefully 
laid pinewood flooring contrasts pleasantly against the solid, 
light-blue painted stone walls. A thick rug of a deep indigo 
blue covers much of the floor underfoot. The wood-framed door to 
the west is inset with crystal panes to allow those inside this 
room a glance into the great hall beyond, while a simplistic, 
undecorated door leads south.

A Cozy, Sitting Room Sporting a Large Fireplace~
   This warm and cozy room is somewhat dark, with its furry black 
rug and deep-red painted walls. A fireplace is built into the 
southern wall of this room and is surrounded by plush leather 
armchairs, providing comfortable heated seating during even the 
coldest of winters. The room is lined with the heads of various 
large game and animals, one wall even sporting the tusk of a bull 
oliphant which takes up nearly the whole length of the room. 
While not overly large, this room could comfortably hold and 
entertain at least eight guests. A large and somewhat unusual 
cage stands in one corner, containing a brightly colored bird 
that often gives a series of rather loud squawks.

The End of the Hall Near a Flight of Red Carpeted Stairs~
   White-painted, wooden stairs lead up toward the top of a 
balcony, a runner of red carpet neatly descending them. Solid 
globes of polished brass have been placed atop the railing. The 
floor is composed of a colorful marble mosaic that one must walk 
across before ascending the staircase or exiting through the 
wooden door at the end of the hallway. To either side of the 
staircase is a potted tree, each rising twice the height of a 
man, though they barely brush the ceiling. Large skylights in 
the roof of the hall allow light to stream in during the day, 
which causes the leaves of the trees to glow with verdant green 
light whenever a stray sunbeam catches them.

brilliant white shine that contrasts strikingly against the dark 
wood floor and vibrant, plush red carpet that runs up the steps 
and down the length of the balcony. Small, rounded marble tables 
are set to either side of the staircase, each holding a lushly 
green potted plant. A painting is displayed on the wall opposite 
the stair, and depicts a Numenorean woman in repose.

An Office and Study with Dark Wood Walls~
   Lavishly appointed, this office mingles business and luxury 
with stylistic ease. The smooth, dark wooden panelling of the 
walls and floor has been kept in pristine, polished condition. 
The ceiling is painted a soft white, creating an illusion of even 
more space in the already generously-sized room. An intricately 
patterned rug in bright Haradaic colors is spread between the 
doorway and the large desk. A statue is posed in one corner, 
depicting a fearsome warg crouched tensely, as if preparing to 
leap upon the viewer. Several tapestries picturing battle and 
hunting scenes decorate the walls, further adding to the sense of 
aristocratic wealth that already pervades this room.

purpose of keeping people in as keeping them out.

occupants feel the need to duck without hitting their heads upon 
the ceiling. Dark-gray brick walls surround this closet turning 
it into a shadowy, and unwelcome trap even when lit.

in the room, likely for the jailers to relax or gamble at while 
they are on duty. Solid iron shackles hang from the north wall 
to hold in place any prisoner who was foolish enough to earn the 
jailers ire. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling, and an odd dripping 
sound echoes about the room like clock work every few minutes.

the back of this cell, while not enough to drink from it makes 
the cell floor quite damp.

banner lightning gauntlet eastern wall~
This banner is several feet wide and very long, extending from
ceiling to floor. It is tightly woven from what looks to be a
very fine wool, and dyed pitch black. In the very center of the
banner, head-height on a tall human, the weave changes shape
and texture to form a representation of a gauntleted fist, and
is dyed a deep bronze colour. Clutched in the fist, the yellow-
dyed weave creating a striking contrast against the black
background, is a lightning bolt, extending diagonally from one
side of the banner to the other. The very bottom edge of the
banner is a slightly duller colour, owing to a heavy layer of
dust collecting there, and the weave is beginning to fray.

various battles and victories of the Black Watch and the slow 
conquest of Gondor. The northern wall is draped with heavy, dark 
curtains that move aside to reveal arrow slits overlooking the 
exterior of the gatehouse.

A Small Conference Hall~
   Not too large, this rectangular room spreads out to the east 
and west, a long table in its center surrounded by the dark, cold 
granite of the four walls. Made to be filled with men in times 
of conference, it is otherwise used seldom. When a voice makes 
itself known, it sounds clearly throughout the entire room, 
having the effect of bouncing from wall to wall, creating a 
somewhat eerie feeling. A simple rug lies underfoot, its 
bleached color adding nothing to the plain furnishings.

A Short, Carpeted Hallway~
   A short hallway leads off from the conference room to the 
east, its flagstone floor covered with a worn, dark purple 
carpet. At its western end, a stone archway marks the beginning 
of a second hallway that runs northward through the headquarters 
of the Black Watch. Flickering torches are mounted along the 
walls with iron brackets, casting a dim light upon the stones.

   Spanning to the south and north, granite blocks have been 
arranged to form an archway overhead, the dark stones lit by 
flickering torchlight. The torches themselves have been mounted 
in iron brackets, large blackened spots defining them clearly 
upon the walls. Made from thick wooden beams, mixed with a large 
portion of granite blocks, the floor of the hall is wide, 
allowing near eight men to pass through, side by side.

A Torchlit, Stone-Walled Hallway~
   Running north and south, this long, granite hall arches at the 
top in a manner that hearkens to classical Numenorean 
architecture. It is lit with flickering torchlight, any air 
currents moving through disturbing the light and toying with the 
shadows in an eerie fashion. Dark banners hang from the arches, 
each one depicting the emblem of the Black Watch.

   Apparently inspired out of need for simplicity, this small

Lit well by a centrally hung lantern, it bears no charactaristics 
of belonging to anyone rich or well off. Minimally furnished, a

away from a cot, little if any dirt finding an easy life on the

The Top of a Drafty Lookout Tower~
   The mournful wind sweeps almost ceaselessly past, this room 
being open to the elements and consequently affording an 
unobstructed view of the corrupted, ruined city that is Minas 
Morgul. The floor is rough, molding grey stone, and a balustrade 
raises up about waist-height on the average orc. Goblins are 
reduced to tiny specks, and orc-kin and larger resemble small 
dolls as they roam the city streets and through the gates leading 
in and out of the Keep below. The forbidding mountain range 
stretches out into the distance, becoming a purple haze as it 
merges with the horizon, and the jagged scar of the vale cuts 
haphazardly along to the west.

   Dark, worn flagstones spread out across the floor of this 
hall, their surfaces cracked and uneven in places. Functioning 
as an antechamber to the complex of rooms beneath Azun Gatekeep, 
the hall is square in shape with doors set in the eastern and 
southern walls. Westward, the raucous noise of soldiers 
accompanied by the aroma of cooking meat waft from a crowded 
messhall. A large tapestry hangs on the northern wall, its 
once-vibrant threads eaten away by moths and the ravages of time.

Sparse Officers' Quarters~
   These quarters are more subdued in noise level than the main 
barracks to the northwest, being inaccessible to the common 
rabble of soldiers that are housed beneath the Gatekeep. 
Sparsely furnished, this room serves as a dining and common 
gathering area for officers of the Baakath-Morgul, as evident by 
the number of tables and chairs placed about the floor. Cast- 
iron lanterns mounted on the walls provide ample lighting, while 
a large hearth is set in the eastern wall.

tables capable of seating hundreds of soldiers. The smoke of 
cooking-fires hangs in the air at all times, creating a hazy 
atmosphere pierced only by the loud bursts of conversation that 
echo around the hall. A wide archway is set in the center of the 
southern wall, leading to an area partitioned off for training, 
while a second archway in the western wall is draped with a heavy 
curtain.

Morgul Tower Road Before a Large Fortress~
   The stone-cobbled path comes to an abrupt halt here at a pair 
of arching iron gates set deeply into the dark granite of a large 
fortress. Two oversized braziers hang from the walls, lit with 
an intense flame at all times of the day and lighting the stairs 
leading up into the stronghold. Both humans and orcs spend time 
wandering this part of the street, and it is heavily patrolled.

s large and bright, casting shadows against the walls as various orc and human-k
ind move up the stairs toward the stronghold.

At the Gates of the Haradrim Quarter~
   A pair of tall, weathered gates stand to the west, leading 
into the Haradrim Quarter. Lashed to the farmost end of each 
gate is a massive ivory tusk that curves outward to cast a shadow 
upon the stone-cobbled path that runs north and south in front of 
the gates. On the eastern side of the street is a squat, stone 
building from which emanate all sorts of loud barking and other 
racket.

he tusk itself is whiteish-yellow in colour, and though mostly smooth, bears man
y small nicks and fine, hairline cracks, some of which may be traced its full le

 crescent-moon, and extends outwards from the gates, casting a pointed shadow on
 the cobbled stone path.

Morgul Tower Road~
   The Morgul Tower road runs straight north and south between 
Azun Gatekeep and the Dark Tower, freshly cobbled of dark black 
stone. High, sturdy walls rise up on either side of the road, 
the western one made of tar-covered logs, while the eastern one 
is constructed from stone. The walls serve to separate areas of 
the city from one another, and cast a shadow upon the street at 
all hours of the day but high noon.

   An ancient stone fence, much older than the construction of 
Minas Morgul, rises up to the east here, a large bronze gate set 
in its center. Numerous human guards pace about the front of the 
gate, granting entrance into the Black Numenorean Quarter of the 
city, while helmeted figures move back and forth along the 
battlements of the wall. Morgul Tower Road continues north 
towards a gatehouse and south towards the tower itself, 
restricted on either side by high walls.

   Morgul Tower Road runs straight north and south between Azun 
Gatekeep and the Dark Tower. Heavily patrolled by swarms of 
orkish forces leaving and returning to and from the tower, this 
road is freshly cobbled, of dark black stone. Noisy at all hours 
of the day, shrill cries can be heard in the distance, often 
coming from the tower, keeping those who pass unnerved, and 
making those leaving the road quicken their pace.

Before the Drawbridge to the Tower of Minas Morgul~
   The massive gate of Morgul Tower lies to the south, across the 
swampy moat of noxious, oily water. The gate itself spans the 
width of the moat, opening like a predatory maw. Orcs patrol 
high above on the battlements, donned with dark robes to shield 
against sunlight, while periodically strange lights dance around 
one of the windows followed by a pained howl. The road branches 
north, west, and east here as it enters different sectors of the 
city.

strewn with a layer of sand and straw to soak up the blood that 
is often shed during training in here, as soldiers battle one 
another fiercely to hone their skills. Some stone benches are 
carved from the wall, jutting out to offer a place to rest in 
between matches. Northward lies the messhall through a set of 
double doors under the archway.

The air is cooler back here than the rest of the building, though 
it reeks of bodily wastes and animal musk.

Arena Road West of an Intersection~
   This stone-cobbled road is well constructed, as it holds up 
against constant battering under the passage of people and carts 
at all hours. The dirt to either side of the road is a cracked 
reddish-brown, and occasionally a sprig of green plant might claw 
its way to the surface only to be trampled by the multitude of 
feet and cart wheels. The dauntingly tall Tower of Minas Morgul 
rises up just to the southeast, across a moat of sulphuric water.

road sees high traffic at all hours of the day, traversed by 
orc-kin and the dark races of men alike as it leads in and out of 
the commercial district of the city. The stone cobbles underfoot 
are tread thin, and though crumbling in some places are generally 
maintained by slave labor.

   Arena Road skirts the rank, sulphuric moat of Morgul Tower to 
the east, curving around its western bank. A busy intersection 
lies to the south, while this road continues its broad path 
southward towards the arena itself, its black spires visible on 
the horizon. Northward is a bend in the road, disappearing past 
the northwestern flank of the tower. Masses of humans and orcs 
move along its length, dispersed by the occasional passing of a 
wagon or cart. To the west, a small opening between a pair of 
dilapidated buildings leads into a refuse-filled alley.

   A steady stream of caravans and wagons turns westward along 
the road here each day, heading into the Slavers' District. 
Lines of shackled slaves, both human and lesser orc-kin, are 
driven at a shuffling pace to their next destination. The ground 
underfoot was smoothly paved at one point in the murky past, but 
is now crumbling in places where the stonework has fallen into 
disrepair. Morgul Tower and its surrounding moat are to the 
east, causing the road to curve slightly.

Morgul Tower, connecting the two halves of the city. Arena Road 
continues its straight, north and south path that leads to and 
from the arena district, heavily traveled by humans in the day 
and orcs at night. To the west, a squat stone building is set 
before a tall wooden fence that runs parallel to the road, a 
secure oak door leading to the interior of the dwelling.

   The crush of passing bodies increases here as the road opens 
up onto Arena Square, the air thick with odors of filth and 
perspiration. Footsteps of Black Watch squads and Morgul 
denizens resound about against the walls of buildings that line 
the street, but are often drowned out by the noise of arguing and 
haggling that burst forth from the square itself to the south. A 
large, windowless building stands to the east, constructed of 
enormous stone blocks.

The Opening to Arena Square~
   Arena Square sprawls out in the shadow of the colossal combat 
arena to the southwest, its grounds one of the most popular in 
the city. Arena Road to the north is the only entrance to this 
place, and is constantly jammed by the flow of bodies going in 
both directions as the acrid odor of blood and sweat assaults the 
nostrils. The square itself is a morass of stalls and carts, 
with winding paths between them that bear no semblance of order.

The Incredibly Noisy Arena Square~
   Arena Square stretches out to the east and west, packed with 
orcs and men alike as they hustle from this place to that, 
trading at all times of the day. Businesses line the edges of 
the square, those established in this corner of the Arena of 
somewhat more upclass and refined than those found in other 
sections of this thriving area of Morgul. Above, on balconies 
and fenced rooftops, well-dressed humans can be seen dwelling 
during the day, wearing a face of constant disdain whenever they 
glance below. A solid wall of buildings block any other exit 
from this square except to the northwest, which leads back into 
the rest of the city.

The Incredibly Noisy Arena Square Before an Inn~
   Vendors' stalls are set up both along the walls of buildings 
lining the square, and freestanding out in the open. Loud 
arguing is commonplace as merchants fight for space and customers 
are jostled through the narrow walkways in between. To the west, 
the stalls thin out a little in the area surrounding a tall 
auction block, while to the north lies the exit to this square. 
   A large, two-storied building of grey stone stands to the 
east, the image of a foaming cask carved on the door.

A Rock-Walled Corner of Arena Square~
   The pervading stench of sweat and blood reaches all parts of 
the square, but this corner of the Arena smells instead more 
strongly of the rich herbs and spices dashed liberally onto the 
sizzling food that numerous dark-skinned hawkers offer as they 
wade through the mostly human crowd. The buildings lining the 
northeast side of the square meet at a corner with a solid rock 
wall that rises up along the southern edge, yet a tiny alleyway 
can be seen in the gap between the gaming den to the northeast 
and the wall. All manner of goods exchange hands at the various 
stalls and tents that have been set up, as orcs and men go about 
their business under the stern gaze of swarthy soldiers of the 
Silvermoon Dervish.

Haradaic Corner of Arena Square~
   The massive amounts of commerce that take place in this corner 
of the Arena Square, and the area that stretches out to the east 
and north, is conducted under the vigilant gaze of the military 
arm of the Haradrim in Minas Morgul, the Silvermoon Dervish, 
sharp-eyed soldiers striding through the capricious paths between 
the tents, stalls, carts and stands erected by the 
merchant-minded denizens of the city as they hawk all manners of 
goods, services and wares, from spicy foods to timid-looking 
young men and women. To the south, a sheer rock wall rises up, 
yet a number of sandstone-constructed buildings have been built 
before it.

A Rock-Walled Corner of Arena Square~
   This corner is relatively peaceful compared to the rest of the 
square, and the air remains somewhat cooler being overcast in 
shadow. A small tent has been set up here under the shelter of 
the cliff's edge. To the south and west, solid rock walls mark 
the perimeter of the square and hem everything in. Along the 
western edge, the rock continues northward and merges with the 
wall of the arena itself.

In the Square Before the Massive Arena~
   The gates to the arena loom above the square here, its thick 
iron bars rising up dozens of feet. A pair of oversized rings 
set in the metal serve as a means to open the gates, requiring 
the combined strength of several to pull. The area within the 
sweep of the gates is cleared of stalls so the double doors may 
swing outward. An intricate relief has been etched into the deep 
stone walls on either side of the gate, depicting gothic figures 
locked in battle and placing the arena clearly not by orkish 
construction.

The Northwestern Corner of Arena Square~
   This corner of the Arena Square is fashioned between the 
towering stone wall of the structure from which the area takes 
its name to the west and a line of ramshackle wooden buildings 
established to the north, the families of somewhat prosperous 
mixed-breed humans dwelling in them and tending to their 
businesses that trade throughout the day with the countless orcs, 
goblins, Harads, Numenoreans and other mongrels crammed into the 
Arena Square. Law and order is established here by the stark 
patrols of crest-helmed, bronze-armoured Black Watch, the stride 
of each of these elite soldiers surrounded by a small circle of 
space, none of the bystanders here willing to dwell too close.

A Side Street South of Morgul Tower~
   Westward, this short street opens out onto Arena Road, where 
during the day many humans turn to cut across the city using this 
street. There is an increased presence of Black Watch soldiers 
here, patrolling the area in strict formation. To the north, the 
sheer walls of Morgul Tower rise up to a dizzying height, forcing 
one to crane one's neck to see the top of the tower. The 
street's cobbles are crumbling away at the edges, succumbing to 
the passage of time and traffic.

Before a Gate at the Base of Morgul Tower~
   Looming ominously here is the malificent Tower of Minas 
Morgul, its back facing the street. A well-oiled portcullis is 
set at its base, across a short stone bridge spanning the moat. 
The tower, constructed of the blackest stone, rises up hundreds 
of feet to a claw-shaped top that rends the sky, its sheer-sided 
walls curving slightly and dotted with narrow windows. The 
gateway is guarded by a duty of Black Watch soldiers, standing 
silent and motionless at their posts.

A Darkened Foyer~
   Dimly lit by fluttering wall lamps, this cold stone room is 
remarkably quiet. Only the most distant echos can be heard of 
the keep proper. A large wall tapestry of the great, lidless eye 
presides over everything, a constant reminder of vigilance. The 
thick iron manacles on the walls and uncomfortable chairs make it 
obvious that visitors can expect little in the way of a warm 
welcome.

A Tightly Twisting Stairwell~
   Winding deeper into the rock, this twisting stairwell curves 
down into the depths of Morgul Tower. Clean and dry, the short, 
sharply turning steps are designed to accomodate those whose feet 
have been chained together. Soot-stained lamps cast an eerie 
glow and set shadows dancing. The ominous flickering and 
capering shades make fitting company to the echoing footsteps 
that carry the doomed to, and more rarely from, the pit below.

   Though well-lit, this room is uncomfortably cold, its stone 
walls stark and unardorned. Thick iron manacles, one set in each 
corner, make this room's purpose as a preliminary holding room 
clear. The soft echo of moans, whimpers of pain, and the 
unmistakeable click of heavy boots on unyielding stone blend to 
provide a constant backdrop of noise.

Essel Azon East of the Intersection Before Morgul Tower~
   The long-established road of Essel Azon wends its way eastward 
deeper into the city, its black surface worn smooth by the 
passage of countless feet. It is fenced to the north by an aged 
wall of dark grey stone, while a fetid moat to the southwest 
surrounds Morgul Tower. Lines of shackled slaves are trafficked 
along this road occasionally, heading in and out of a set of iron 
gates in the distance, while at night time the majority of 
passerby are made up of orc-kin.

   Smooth, black stone has been worn away by the passage of too 
many feet as this road leads past Morgul Tower to the west and 
towards the orkish quarter to the south. The piles of trash seen 
elsewhere in the slums are kept to a minimum here and enough 
guard patrols pass to make this place somewhat secure. To the 
north and east, an aged wall of dark grey stone blocks off the 
road from another sector of the city, its parapet manned by 
figures in bronze armor.

Essel Azon West of Some Iron Gates~
   The grime-covered stone wall to the east rises up to form a 
crude archway, crowning a set of iron gates that open eastward 
into a section of the city obscured by haze. A malformed 
figurehead is mounted at the center of the arch, the horned head 
of some beast with gaping mouth and curled tongue glaring down at 
those who pass through the gates. Essel Azon continues its 
slowly curving path north and south, frequented by throngs of 
orcs and goblins.

   The winding road of Essel Azon enters the slums to the south 
here. Patrols of orc soldiers make their way noisily through at 
regular intervals, scattering commoners to the sides and into 
dwellings lining the road until they have passed. A high, 
roughly-constructed wall of blackened stone rises up to the east, 
billowing smoke visible from behind it accompanied by metallic 
clanging sounds at all hours.

Sharkundu Road to the south, while a dirt path heads into the 
slums to the east and a short side street cuts past Morgul Tower 
to the west. Though the main press of travelers moving through 
here are orkish in nature, a number of humans move along the 
western and southern roads, especially during the day. The 
center of the intersection is a mish-mash of broken cobbles as 
the separate stones of each different street run out.

covered in metal spikes.

bronze double-doors stand to the south, baring travel further into

The Foaming Cask~
   This shopfront is rather small, making up the front of a stone 
building. The stone walls are unpanelled, retaining their 
blotchy grey colour. Shelves line the room, containing plenty of 
space for the display of multicoloured bottles, and room for 
casks and barrels underneath. A door to the east leads further 
into the building, while to the west a door opens up into the 
Arena Square. The scent of incense and herbs lies heavy in the 
area, warding off the stench of sweat and blood from the street. 
The stone wall to the south bears a large passageway in it, 
leading to a larger, warmer room, whilst the northern side of the 
building is occupied by a wooden staircase leading upwards, a 
stout door set at the top. 
   A sizable crowd squeezes into the small frontroom of the Cask, 
mostly human in origin, though a number of orcs and goblins 
gather here, drifting in from the Arena Square.

even the occasional pale-skinned man seated amongst the tables.

A Large Workroom and Living Area~
   This room is rectangular in shape, with rough, grey-stone 
walls and floor. The roof is relatively high and vaulted, with 
two small, rounded windows set high in the walls. Lamps light 
the room dimly at all hours of the day. Most of the room has 
been converted into a workroom, with various tools and brewing 
implements strewn about the area. A small cot takes up one 
corner, which has been set up as a sleeping area. Simple wooden 
doors, both bearing locks and keyholes, are set in the western 
and southern walls, leading to other parts of the building. The 
keyhole on the western door looks peculiarly large.

   The rock walls press in on three sides as well as above and

some of them tined with blood. A pile of straw has been hastily 
thrown in one corner, while a stone trough stands on the opposite 
end of the pen.

A Cloth-Draped Building Made of Sandstone~
   With walls of rough, light colored sandstone and a high 
ceiling hidden by swaths of brightly dyed cloths in a myriad of 
colors, this abode has a distinct tribal, desert feel, even among 
the crowd and noise of the city. Airy and fragrant with herbs 
and very little clutter besides the furnishings, the atmosphere 
is quiet and relaxed. Pallets and bedrolls for the wounded are 
arranged along the back wall, behind a swaying curtain made of 
multiple beaded twists of cloth. A low, round table scattered 
with medical tools and neat piles of bandages and salves 
dominates the center of the room, and piles of pillows and 
cushions heaped on the rug-draped floor provide spaces to sit.

An Orderly Shop Full Of Parchments And Books~
   This shop is small and cramped, but extremely neat. The floor 
and walls are made from pine, the boards sanded smooth and left 
unpainted. Several large candelabras have been set around the 
shop, their tallow candles providing a flickering light. Shelves 
and tables run down the center of the shop, stacks of loose 
parchment and writing quills arranged neatly upon them. Two 
large bookshelves line the walls at the back of the shop, behind 
a long counter, and bear volumes of blank leather-bound tomes and 
books. A plush crimson rug is laid before the entryway and 
provides a place to wipe one's feet, though even it seems to be 
kept meticulously clean.

draped with a patterned blue and yellow curtain and a sandstone 
wall draped with rugs, this room has a comfortable yet efficient 
air to it. The clutter is neatly arranged, though loose threads 
and bits of lint liberally cover the carpets that cover the 
floor. There are no windows, so the air is slightly stifled, but 
the lingering scent of incense sweetens it, and light is provided 
by a series of fine glass lanterns.

A Dark, Hot Basement~
   Steep and foreboding, the stairs that lead into the cellar are 
shoddily made and creek and groan under pressure. The cellar 
itself is fairly warm, though somewhat dimly lit. The stairs are 
juxtaposed to the eastern side of the stone-walled cellar, while 
on the western side a large forge is enclosed, pushed against the 
wall. The enclosure for the forge is made out of a large pile of 
stones, and a shallow pit sits low into the ground to hold the 
massive forge. The floor is blackened with a coat of soot and 
dust, especially around the foot of the forge. 
   The ceiling is high-set and has only one opening, the 
trap-door above the stairs.

'The Azure Dragon' Gaming Den~
   A lavish painting, depicting a raging storm beating tumultuous 
seas against rocky outcroppings in garishly bright colours 
stretches across the four stone walls of this large gaming den. 
Gathered beneath the unmellowed wooden ceiling is a large crowd 
of men, mostly swarthy in appearance, clustered about numerous 
tables rolling dice, drinking from small glasses and smoking 
pipeweed. A thin haze of sweet smelling smoke hangs in the air 
here, the atmosphere hot and sultry. Two doors lead out of the 
gaming den, the larger opening westward out onto the frantic 
Arena Square, the smaller leading to deeper inside the building. 
A staircase near the centre of the room leads down to a pit.

A Small And Cluttrered Backroom~
   Four solid stone walls, built from some type of black igneous 
rock, form this small room. Whilest easily allowing the 
accomodation of multiple people, when combined with the 
furnishings and far from high wooden ceiling cramped conditions 
can quickly occur. Dust and cobwebs gather freely in the corners 
of the backroom, and a persistent mold spreads across the 
southern wall. From the west, the muted sounds of life filter 
through the wooden door set in the stone wall. A wooden ladder 
fixed in place rests on the northern edge of the room, leading up 
to a small trapdoor, whilest a wooden closet occupies much of the 
south. A door made from heavy oak swings outwards, opening out 
to a yard.

A Broad Attic With A Low Ceiling~
   Making up the entire upper floor of this building, the wooden 
walls of this attic are set far apart, yet the spacious nature of 
this architecture is negated by the low ceiling; at the edges of 
the room, the slope of the roof would force nearly all save the 
shortest of men to bend down, whilest in the centre of the attic 
one's movement is less restricted. A pair of small windows looks 
down onto the street below to the west, a similiar pair offering 
a view down into a barren yard to the east, a heavy shutter 
placed over each of them. A trapdoor set on the northern edge of 
the attic allows one passage downward.

Dusty, Fenced-In Yard At the Back of a Building~
   To the north, east and south, a high wooden fence runs, 
forming the boundaries of this yard. Beyond the fence 
dark-walled buildings rise up, fashioned variously of stone and 
wood. To the west a heavy oak door lies, set in the base of a 
two-storyed building, the first floor made of solid black stone 
whilest the second has been constructed of wood. Grainular dirt, 
a dark brown in colour, stretches across the expanse this small 
yard, marked with the occasional irregularly shaped stone or 
clump of weeds. The ebbing tide of the cacophany of noises that 
is Minas Morgul wafts in from the west.

moths, light can be seen.

wall to the other. Ringing their way around the outside of the 
room is a series of wooden shelves, bearing upon them a variety 
of goods, from fine wooden bows and arrows to more mundane, 
everyday items. Whether day or night, a few patrons of various 
origins can be seen lingering in the store, perusing through its 
inventory. Two doors lead from the storefront, a large portal to 
the east out onto the streets of Minas Morgul and a smaller 
passageway opening outwards to the west.

   The dark-stone walls of this room are set far apart, creating 
a large enough area for one to comfortable work and rest in. The 
high ceiling sports a set of three windows, heavy wooden shutters 
placed over them, their presence allowing a slow breeze into the 
area that brings with it the eternal drone of Morgul. A floor 
made of closely placed wooden planks runs underfoot, the boards 
bending ever so slightly when weight is placed upon them. The 
southward wall of this large room is taken up by a wooden closet, 
a ragged blue curtain separating it from the rest of the room. A 
trapdoor lies in the north-west corner of this area, and a solid 
oak door opens inwards to the east.

Between The Close-Set Walls Of The Storage Closet~
   Little more than a closet, nearly all the available space in 
this tiny room of wood is devoted to shelve space, storing the 
supply of the various goods offered for sale in the shopfront. 
The cramped conditions caused by the nearness of the four walls 
of this small space leaves little room for movement, the wooden 
floorboards creaking loudly when stepped upon. A ragged curtain, 
a pale blue in colour, hangs before a narrow gap in the northern 
wall.

Large, Stone-Walled Cellar~
   The air in this large cellar holds a certain staleness to it, 
yet while initially discomforting it quickly fades from immediate 
notice. A black, igneous stone has formed the walls and floor of 
this basement, the roof made from close-set planks of wood. A 
grey, flaky fungus rules over the upper corners between the 
ceiling and the walls in the cellar, yet apart from this growth 
there is little else in the way of dust or debris here. A thin, 
rickety ladder, its sturdiness improved somewhat by the crude 
metal bolts that attach it to the floor, ascends at a steep angle 
upwards towards the large trapdoor located in the north-west 
corner of the cellar.

   Regular blocks of pale limestone have been neatly stacked upon 
one another to form the walls of this large workroom, rising up 
to a flat ceiling constructed of ebon-hued wood. Underfoot, 
close-set tiles of a warm amber color spread from the southern 
end of the room, continuing through the slender archway set in 
the north wall. A reinforced timber door opens outwards to the 
east, the rise and ebb of distant voices combined with spicy 
aromas and exotic scents wafting slowly through it. A second, 
dark-grained wooden door leads southward, lighter than the sturdy 
portal to the east. A narrow staircase fashioned from the same 
stone as the walls runs hatches, both inlaid with an iron ring.

main chamber that lies to the south through a slender archway cut 
out from the limestone walls of this building. Here, numerous 
shelves and benches ring about the exterior of the room, and the 
air here is pungent with the smell of spices and meat. From the 
dark wood that forms the flat ceiling to the amber tiles that lay 
underfoot, this kitchen is near spotless, cobwebs and dust not 
present amongst the desert hues of the furnishings here. From 
the ceiling, suspended by a thin metal chain, a brass lamp hangs, 
casting its golden light across the chamber.

   A thick, canvas tarpaulin dyed a dusky sand yellow stretches 
from end to end of the high limestone walls in this rooftop 
garden, a sizable section removed from the middle to allow the 
weather to grace the collection of plants arranged in a broad, 
flat pottery bowl that dominates the center of the area. Four 
wooden beams extend upwards from the corners of this central 
display, helping support the loosely drawn shade cloth, the 
material curving downwards slightly as it spans from the poles to 
the pale stone walls. Bordering the edge of the rooftop are more 
plants, held in elaborately glazed pottery, a narrow path of 
amber tiles formed between this flora and that in the middle. In 
the north-west corner, a thick wooden hatch opens outwards,

spread of plush pillows dyed bright colors, set above well laid 
tiles of a barley hue. A hot, sultry atmosphere is generated by 
the adorning veils of fabric, the lack of windows containing the 
languid heat in this small chamber. A dark wooden door, set in 
the northern wall, opens outwards, offering an exit from the 
bedroom.

sizes with the various shop assistants. A counter stretches

'Weaponry of the Crescent'~
   Decorated from floor to ceiling in exotic, 
garishly-contrasting colours, this room's walls of stone are 
buried beneath multiple layers of paint and tapestry. The 
counter is, without a doubt, the only unpainted furnishing in 
this room; it is, however, etched with numerous swirls and whorls 
upon its surface, giving it ample decoration. All about the room 
are racks, shelves, and hangers, upon which rest fine weaponry of 
every sort, though scimitars and spears seem to be prevalent. 
   A door to the north bars passage into the private recesses of 
the building, while the door to the south opens back upon the 
street.

A Wide, Pitted Workroom~
   The limestone blocks that make up this building have been 
painted a plethora of garish, brilliant and rich colors, ranging 
from silvery-white to a vivid crimson to a lavish indigo. 
Tapestries have been hung all about, most depicting glorious 
soldiers leading armies into battle beneath a silvery crescent 
moon. A massive forge rests in a sunken, foot-deep tiled pit in 
the northeastern corner of the room, the rest of the room 
carpetted in a rich, lavish coral. 
   Elaborate arches have been carved into the northern, western, 
and eastern walls, glass beads dangling down from the latter. A 
stairway leads both up and down, while the door to the south 
allows access back out to the shop.

A Garishly-Painted Octagonal Kitchen~
   Little more than six feet by six feet, nearly half of this 
cramped kitchen's space is accomodated by its large stove. 
Nearly the entirety of the remainder is afforded to the number of 
shelves and utensils that pepper the room. The floor is of wine 
red tile, and the walls painted a gaudy fuschia colour. A 
simple, doorless archway least east, back into the workshop.

A Half-Circle Room With a Domed Ceiling~
   Rich coral-hued carpet covers the floor of this half-circular 
room, the curve using the door as its epicenter. The ceiling, 
instead of peaking or laying flat as most do, simply curves up 
with the wall, coming to a graceful dome above the room. 
Numerous windows are set into the wall; the one set due east is 
easily the largest, and the most exotic looking. It is made of 
elaborate, richly-hued stained glass, and depicts a silvery 
crescent moon in the center of a six-pointed starburst. When the 
sun rises, the light from this window splays about the room, 
though some filters directly at the doorway in the western wall, 
back toward the workroom.

A Long, Narrow Bedroom~
   Stretching along the entire length of the building, this 
hardwood-walled room is obviously a later addition to the rest of 
the building. Bearing a couple small beds, the room's paint is 
no less garish than the rest of the building's: an airy teal has 
been liberally applied to the walls, trimmed in deep hunter 
green. The floor here, however, remains a stained umber brown 
wood, as opposed to the carpetting found elsewhere. 
   A single door leads southward.

An Undecorated, Rack-Lined Storage Cellar~
   Lined with racks upon racks for holding weaponry of different 
sizes, styles, and types, this room bears on bleak, stark 
contrast to the rest of the building: it was built with function, 
not decoration, in mind. This is easily noted in the absence of 
paint on the greyish limestone walls and the cold, hard limestone 
floor. The door leading to the staircase is the only exit.

A Cozy, Outlandish Bedroom~
   A veritable riot of colours, this room spares no expense in 
pleasing--or possibly displeasing--the eye. The floor is covered 
with an ornate rug, crisscrossing whorls of indigo and crimson 
upon its coral-hued surface. Upon the walls hang numerous 
tapestries, all of the same series depicting a brigandine-clad 
warrior fighting an opponent under a crescent moon. A 
stained-glass window has been set into the eastern wall, 
depicting just that: a silver crescent moon. Into the western 
wall is a stained-glass window of octangular shape, is vivid 
rendition that of a six-pointed starburst. 
   The only way out is the vividly-carved door to the stairway.

A Vivaciously-Painted Workroom~
   Though this workroom's walls are of hewn, cut limestone, one 
would not notice at first glance, for the walls are a myriad of 
rich, brilliant, and at times, gaudy colors. Alive with ancient, 
well-kept tapestries of six-pointed starbursts and a large one in 
particular portraying a nature scene--lit by a silver crescent 
moon--the walls are far from bare. In spite of this, this room 
seems to be used more for creation rather than recreation, as 
numerous shelves, utensils, tables, benches, and a massive forge 
itself all reside here, and seem to be used frequently. 
   A staircase winds its way both up and down upon the northern 
wall, ending at a hatch in both directions. To the west, a 
carved door is set, while to the east, past countless strings of 
delicate glass beads, resides a kitchen.

A Cramped Storage Cellar~
   Far from accomodating, this small room has no real use other 
than as a storage compartment for the shop's goods. Of limestone 
bricks, this one bears none of the decoration commonly displayed 
throughout the rest of the building; rather, it is functional in 
its build, and is used to store the overflow for the shop.

this kitchen smells of exotic spices and warm, outlandish drinks. 
The tiles that comprise the floor and the lower half of the wall 
are of a rich goldenrod color, and have a definite shine to them. 
The stove is tucked into the corner, and a number of holes have 
been bored above it, slanted into the wall to provide 
ventilation.

A Recessed, Garishly-Painted Circular Bedroom~
   Rising from the floor below like a pedastal, this circular 
room bears little in the way of furnishings; however, it is no 
less astounding than the rest of the building. Cut out of the 
southern wall is a large circle, and in its place is a mosaic of 
stained glass, its portrayal that of a six-pointed starburst. 
The room's walls are, otherwise, quite bare, if painted a rich, 
airy teal in color. A bed of dark yellow silk sheets is set into 
a circular recession in the exact middle of the room, requiring a 
step of a foot down into this exotically- carpetted circle. 
   The only exit is the hatch, which leads back down to the 
workroom.

A Vividly-Painted, Tiered Room With a Vaulted Ceiling~
   From the onset, this room bears an outlandish decadence unseen 
in most parts of the city in which it resides. Three separate 
tiers comprise the room, each set three feet higher than the one 
before it; to the south, the lowest floor sits, and to the north, 
the highest floor stands aloft. Staircases along both the 
western and eastern walls gradually slope, affording easy access 
from level to level. The ceiling, from the highest tier, is nine 
feet high; the tiers themselves are each about eight by six feet. 
The middle and top levels each bear a single bed apiece, both 
veiled in sheer curtains of silk. The bottom tier, as well, 
bears beds, though it bears four of much lesser splendor. 
   The only exit afforded by the room is the door the east.

Twisting Alleyway Through the Mongrel Ghetto~
   Leading roughly from east to west, in a series of jagged 
twists and turns, this stench-ridden alleyway is formed as a path 
wide enough for only two men to move down abreast leads between a 
collection of dilapidated wooden shacks. During the hours of the 
day, a collection of rag-clad, wary-eyed humans cluster about the 
ghetto, their physique clearly of mixed heritage. To the west, 
the alleyway continues deeper in the mire and filth, while a 
broad road opens eastward, a towering fort close by.

   A hard-packed dirt road branches to the east and west here, 
the way made treacherous by the variety of refuse and garbage 
scattered underfoot. Shards of crockery and glass interspersed 
between scraps of metal and general midden litter the area, an 
abundance of vermin rustling through the filth in search of food. 
Lining the alley to the north and south are a series of 
ill-constructed huts, fashioned from scavenged wood and metal and 
no doubt providing only dubious shelter from the elements. To 
the north, a much-frequented yet rundown establishment lies, a 
wooden fence opposite it to the south.

Twisting Trail Through the Human Slums~
   The twisting trail of the alley leads from the east, branching 
off towards the north through the human ghetto yet not before 
swelling to a large dirt square between decrepit cottages. The 
repugnant aroma of human filth assails the nostrils here, wafting 
from the debris scattered randomly throughout the slums. A 
battered, twisted metal lamp rises from the centre of the 
intersection, flickering with a dull light during the night. To 
the north, towering above the dilapidated housing is a large 
wooden palliside.

Dead End in the Slums Before A Large Building~

the human ghetto comes to an end to the east here, ending in a 
small semi-circle of houses set in various states of disrepair. 
Vermin run openly along the streets, weaving in and out of the 
midden piles that line the path. A foul stench, composed of 
human filth and sweat, sits stagnant in the air, an assault on 
the senses equaled only by the great clamor of noise that invades 
from the south. A large building, a mere tattered shell, stands 
to the north.

overlapping timbers. From the south and west, distant sounds of 
screams and shouts, along with a great hubbub of 
indistinguishable chatter flows in, blanketing the area with a 
coarse aural background. Southwards, the alley leads deeper into

east, south and west the Arena Square stretches onwards, a

The Butcher Shop~
   This building is partitioned so that the shopfront is 
relatively small compared to most of those nearby. However, it 
is organised and clean, with a few shelves of dried meats and 
other goods, but most of the activity taking place at the very 
wide counter along the back wall of the shop. At almost all 
hours, customers in loose clothing come in to shop, their exotic 
speech rippling through the air as they socialize. One 
freshly-varnished door leads out of the building, past 
flamboyantly-colored hangings painted with desert scenes.

Wooden Landing Looking Out Over Arena Square~
   This landing spreads from the inwards opening door set in the 
western wall, a plain staircase leading down into a noisome bar. 
Yet the shouts and calls from below are dwarfed by the tidal roar 
of sound that blows through the shuttered windows set in the 
western wall, looking out across Minas Morgul's massive arena 
square and the thriving throng of men and orcs, slaves and 
freeman that clusters before the towering stone edifice on the 
Arena. The walls that separate the landing from the masses of 
Morgul are of an unmellowed wood, small doors set in them to the 
north and south and a corridor extending to the east.

Wooden Hallway Leading Past Doors~
   Leading from east to west, this hallway has been constructed 
from pale cedar boards, the quality of the construction 
unnoticeable save for the occasional jutting nail. Three small 
doors, of no particularly secure nature, lead off to the north, 
east and south from this corridor, travel to the west leading to 
a landing overlooking the Arena Square. Hanging from the roof is 
a small lamp, casting its dull light over the area during the

Plain Room Overlooking A Dusty Yard~
   This room is large enough to easily hold its furnishings and a 
number of occupants, yet could not be considered large or 
expansive by any scale. Cedar planks for the ceiling, walls and 
floor of this room, kept clean from dust or cobwebs. The faint 
background sounds of Minas Morgul float through the eastern 
shutters, allowing the weather in during the day and offering a 
view on a dusty yard to the south east. A small door opens 
outwards, set in the western wall of the room.

Dirt-Floor Fighting Pit~
   Large enough to contain a sizable crowd, this fighting pit has 
been hacked out from the earth, stout beams supporting the 
wooden-plank ceiling. A wide staircase descends from the 
northern edge of the room, a path of low wooden benches set about 
the ringed off pit in the centre of the area here. Large enough 
to hold only a few people and allowing them movement, the floor 
of the middle pit is dirt, stained with various dark fluids and 
littered with the occasional tooth. From the stairwell, noises 
of raucous gaming flows. Standing in one corner of the area 
above the pit is a crest-helmed member of the Black Watch, 
ensuring fights are kept from becoming too fatal.

Branching Paths off the Entrance to the Human Ghettos~
   The packed-earth alley leads in from the south, before jerking 
to the north and east, the sudden shift in direction dictated by 
the borders of the patchwork housing. From beyond the rickety 
doors and scrapwood shutters, occasionally dwelling in the narrow 
street during the day, ill-dressed, dirt-covered humans of 
mongrel breed dwell, glaring suspiciously at those that pass 
through their ghetto. Progress to the east and norths leads down 
paths through the slums, while to the south the alley ends, 
opening out onto a bustling road.

Sweat-Reeking Dingy Interior~
   Heavy scents of sweat dominate this somewhat small room, the 
near constant crowd gathered amongst the tattered environs doing 
little to clear the air. Those gathered here represent a broad 
spectrum of Morgulite society; humans of pale and dark skin, even 
a few orcs and goblins, the only unifying theme their grimy, 
homespun clothing. A staircase, composed of misshapen wooden 
planks and jutting nails, leadings upward at a bent angle to the 
second floor of this decrepit premises. A thin door opens out to 
the south.

Creaking, Rickety Landing~
   This narrow landing seems to be a later addition to the rest 
of the dilapidated building, the two hues of wood juxtaposing; 
unmellowed and light on the top and dark and rotting on the 
bottom. A short hallway extends a mere dozen feet to the north 
of the stairwell, a number of narrow doors leading off, behind 
which emits grunting sounds at irregular periods. A stale, 
sweaty smell seems imbued in the walls of the landing here, the 
sensation lessening only slightly down the stairs.

Filth Strewn Common Room Lined With Pallets~
   Set around the circular frame of this ancient building are 
numerous pallets, the occasional occupied by a sleeping vagabond 
human form. A small crowd of dirt-smeared men and women of pale 
skin gather in this room at all hours of the day, tending to 
small tasks such as cooking and darning. Spiders crawl over the 
uneven wooden ceiling, and small vermin scuttle about in the 
corners of the room, generally unnoticeable amongst the filthy 
environs. A shattered door, barely clinging to its hinges swings 
to and fro at the merest suggestion of a breeze to the south of 
the room, whilst a hole-filled staircase leads upwards.

Second Floor Of The Building, The Roof Long Gone~
   Perhaps due to some freak accident, or something more 
sinister, the roof of this large building has been torn off; the 
large wooden support beams reaching to waist height before ending 
in a jagged fistful of large splinters. Scraps of lumber and 
rusted nails cover the floor here, the debris shifting and 
tumbling down at the slightest movement through the area. The 
cityscape of Morgul is clearly visible from this ruined 
structure; the Haradrim palisade to the north, the Numenorean 
stone walls to the east, and the massive arena to the south-west. 
A large section of the northern wall is missing, a trail of 
shattered wood leading down into a midden-filled yard.

   The numerous holes and punctures into the wooden frame of the

up and down it with little trouble. For those that or not, or 
simply unlucky, a swift fall leads down onto the hard dirt of a 
large yard set below the building.

Midden-Filled Yard~
   Narrow, crooked trails lead through the piles of midden that 
dominate this yard, a bent wooden fence surrounding it to the 
north, east and west whilst a large building rises up to the 
south, seeming on the verge of collapse. Some effort has been 
made to deal with the infestation of filth; shallow pits have 
been dug out of the hard earth, covering minor amounts of the 
garbage, whilst charred and blackened segments of the yard show 
areas where things have been burnt, leaving a tar-like residue. 
Flies and insects buzz freely in the air, their presence hand in 
hand with the rancid, rotten smell that dominates the air here.

A Stark, Unwelcoming Cell~
   Barely enough room for a grown man to lay down, this small, 
cramped, uncomfortable and barren room has no features save the 
sturdy hatch set at the top of the stairs in one corner. They 
come down, flush against the western wall, leaving no place for 
anyone to hide in this tiny, bare cube. Large, smooth flagstones 
make up floor, wall and ceiling and only a small iron hook for 
hanging a lantern on the wall breaks the lifeless monotony of 
this forlorn cell in any way.

Bleak Stone Room~
   Little more than four stones walls and a wooden ceiling and 
floor, this stone room is big enough to contain its furnishings 
and a few people. The walls are dirty, scatterings of dirt and 
grime spread sporadically across the room. A pair of shutters, 
barred by iron and wood, look out onto the street to the east, 
set either side of a stout, iron-reinforced oak door. A narrow 
staircase leads upwards, running along the north and west wall, 
passing by a precariously hanging lantern. A trapdoor in the 
centre of the room opens outwards to a dank basement. 
   To the west, the stonework looks to have been recently added 
upon, a heavy oak door set in the wall there.

cellar. A narrow staircase of stone leads upwards to a solid

   A small space set between the ground floor and the flat stone 
roof, this attic is high enough only for the shortest of men to 
walk without hunching and ducking, lest they strike their heads 
against the hard, dark-stoned roof. No windows or shutters allow 
a glimpse out onto the streets of Morgul nor let air pass through 
the room, creating a stagnant, slightly claustrophobic 
atmosphere. An opening in the wooden floorboards in the north of 
the room allows one to descend down a stone staircase to the 
first floor of the building.

   The ceiling lifts away, stretching like a yawning black abyss

dozen floors of the Tower without the glimmer of a single torch or 
lantern to give surcease to the gloom.  Great bronze double doors 
bar travel north, and a narrow set of steps is cut into the floor on 
the eastern wall, winding down.

   This sparse open yard, nestled up against the black stone
walls surrounding the tower, is floored in raked dirt.  A
target for archery is set up on one side and a small pen and
section of fencing is on the other side for tying up mounts.
A few slaves move here and there, carrying saddles and barding,
but otherwise this area is as silent as much of the rest of the
Tower.  To the west, a barn is built against the walls and to
the south the covered stalls of the cavalries horses rises up
nearly two stories.  The distant sound of snorting animals 
coming from the stable doors.

nickle-stud lined door of glossy black steel to the south.
Embossed into the center of which is a graven image of a
lightning bolt held by a fist, shining silver against the 
dark metal. The floors are quieted with a dark black carpet,
edged in silver, muffling the few sounds that come into this
corner of the Tower.

Dun Arath Grocer~

A pair of windows flank the door like soldiers, their panes

Kregg's Clubs and Guts~
   Numerous crates of weaponry have been stacked about beneath 
the low rock ceiling, a constant stream of burly orcs and snaga 
running to and fro the large southern entrance of the area 
carrying in new boxes or taking away empty ones. A number of 
other denizens dwell within the cave, looking over the arrayed 
selection of gleaming and wickedly pointed weapons.

being stabled and removed line the eastern and western walls

of slaves in various degrees of health and condition.  Wounded,
obviously badly beaten ones, seem to have received basic medical
care, while more healthy and fit slaves rest on small mats.  While
the whole range of pens could hold perhaps two dozen slaves, though
it is rarely more than half full.

set this corner cell apart.  It seems designed for a single
occupant as well, unlike the others.

A Cool Stone Cellar~
   Made of large black flagstones, this room is cool and just
a bit damp.  The small stairs lead up to the kitchen proper,
and several shelves line the walls for the storage of kitchen
supplies. Clean, spacious and well organized, it is lit by
a brace of bronze lanterns attached to the walls.

The Beginning of a Damp Tunnel~
   A crude staircase has been carved into the ground leading into 
this damp tunnel. There is absolutely no light and only the 
smell of the dampened earth that make up the walls of the tunnel 
lingers. The shape of the tunnel is a misshapen rectangle-like 
shape.

   The tunnel comes to an abrupt halt at this place. The end of 
the tunnel is rounded and a good amount of gravel and partially 
dug dirt is upon the makeshift ground. A trapdoor fixed into the 
ground below looks beaten and damaged, exposing hard packed dirt 
beneath it. 
   A strip of metal that once was the lock sticks up sharply from 
the trapdoor, apparently broken.

stunted creature to stand without striking their head upon the 
low rock ceiling, a thin grate of metal resides in the centre of

enough for one to attempt to squeeze through. Rising to one's

   Hunks of corroded metal and wood decorate this stone-walled

across the southern section of the room, where a hole has been 
knocked out and a darkened cave lurks. Cobwebs grow across the 
ceiling, the mummified bodies of ancient insects trapped up 
amidst them, and the occasional prowling spider seen stalking 
along the silver thin lines. On the northern side, a rickety 
staircase with many broken panels leads up to a trapdoor.

this building, save a rug of dust that hangs heavy in the air. 
Wooden slates run across a number of thick beams that range from 
one end of the building to the other, rusted iron bolts stamped 
through the ancient timber. The air within this large room is 
musty and stale, no windows in the grey walls made from 
regular-carved stone. To the west, a wooden appendage to the 
building is visible, a spiral stairwell leading on through a 
crude stone arch. In the centre of the floor a trapdoor lies, 
the pull ring thoroughly rusted.

wrapping itself about the northern wooden wall. Set below this

   This wooden stairwell has been built onto the side of the 
larger, scorch-marked stone building, yet the timber has suffered 
poorly, some parts of the walls sprouting mold and fungus, 
numerous stairs cracked and weak underfoot, and the ceiling is 
mostly missing, allowing one a clear view of the skies above 
Minas Morgul. The sounds of the city drift it from above, faint 
here, and the battered remains of a door swing idly in the wind 
to open out to the stone roof. The rickety stairs lead down, 
deeper into the building.

Blackened Stone Rooftop~
   Scraps of charred wood roam across this stone rooftop, great 
smears and streaks of soot ranging across it. It is rather 
large, the grey stones fashioning the building placed tightly 
together. Yet, despite this, moss and fungus sprout out from 
between the few cracks, and the occasional black shell of an 
insect can be seen darting in and about the rooftop. A knee high 
parapet runs about the edge of the rooftop, save on the eastern 
side where the stones are lone gone, instead the top of a pile of 
crates stacked against the wall visible. The western end of the 
rooftop is occupied by a wooden shack built atop of the stone, 
the ragged remains of a door covering the doorway.

from outside a large tavern before coming across a large stone 
wall, the grey stones marched with many scorch marks. Filth of 
an organic nature covers the rough dirt of the alley here, and 
the occasional bumbling patron lurches from the east to further

Morgul, wide enough to allow someone to squeeze through.

Slanted Wooden Rooftop Overlooking Morgul~
   This wooden roof bears many holes and tears in it, the entire 
southern half of it ripped off by some past event, leaving thick 
wooden support beams and a dingy stairwell visible. To the 
north, the looming presence of Morgul Tower, and then the massive 
edifice of Azun Gatekeep are visible, burning bright with 
torchfire at night. East, a lower section of the roof of this 
building lies, and past it the black sprawl of the goblin slums. 
The gigantic Arena rises up to the west, before it the screaming 
cacophony of the Arena Square, and the mingling human and yrcish 
denizens. Careful footing required here, less one slips on the 
rotted wooden shingles as is cast into a distant, rubble-strewn

Slaves Room~
   This plain wooden plank room lacks the comfort and garish
extravegance of the rooms below. Small, a bit on the warm
side, it has a plain tan rug on the floor and a number of
efficient bunk beds. A series of shelves provides space for
any private effects and a small table and chair gives room
for what quiet socializing goes on here among the staff.
Aside from the occasional cries drifting up from below,
the room is otherwise quiet and comfortable, lit by simple
bronze wall sconces.

with juxtaposition of soft and sensual against sharp promises

blanketed with ornate hangings depicting various acts of torture,
bondage and general depravity in finely woven cotton. The room
is illuminated by spaced bronze lamps in garish stained glass,
setting the room alight in an array of colors against the dark
wood walls and thick black carpet.

Northern Edge of the Arena Square, Before a Lumberyard~
   Those gathered in the Arena Square in this corner of it are of 
a distinctive breed, a certain feral and unwashed humankind, 
their hair long and clothing ragged, moving in and about the 
clamoring hawkers with as much enthusiasm for the barter and 
bargaining as any other denizen of Minas Morgul. Progress to the 
north through the Arena Square is hemmed in by a row of buildings 
in that direction, their construction crude and from wood of 
dubious quality. A rough wall made of wooden logs runs a short 
distance to the north, a crude gate leading to a lumberyard.

Northern Side of the Arena Square~
   A row of buildings constructed from either black stone or dark 
wood lines the northern edge of this section of the Arena Square, 
most of them of multiple stories, sending out jutting balconies 
above the dirt of the street, the occasional well-dressed, 
pale-skinned human seen behind the heavily barred windows and 
doorways of the houses here. While to the south massive crowds 
throng about with much noise and commotion, this section of the 
Arena Square is slightly less populated, the dour presence of the 
bronze-clad Black Watch an intimidating sight as they patrol 
here.

Arena Square Corner Inhabited by Mongrel Humans~
   The great mass of humans and goblins that filter in to the 
Arena Square from the distant north east to dwell amongst the 
sales of slaves and the spectacles of the Arena pause here to 
observe the many wares for sale and countless vendors shouting 
the prices of various goods beneath the shadow of the ominous 
Arena itself, the pitted stone wall of the structure rising up to 
the direct west. On occasion, the dull thumps of the drumming 
lifts up from the top of the wall, filling this area of the Arena 
Square with a primal beat.

Amidst the Crush of Denizens in Arena Square~
   An immense crowd of denizens of Minas Morgul crowd about here, 
movement through the area conducted through elbowing and shoving 
aside the rag-clothed human mongrels and reeking goblins that 
cluster about the stalls and stands, or pause to watch the 
numerous scenes of excitement that take place at any one time; 
masters beating errant slaves, crest-helmed soldiers of the Black 
Watch summarily executing pickpockets before quickly turning to 
pacify a quarrel between a merchant and a buyer over the price of 
an item. A great heat rises up in the area, no matter the time 
of the day or the weather, the great throng of moving the bodies 
warming the Arena Square even in the dead of winter.

Narrow Path Through the Stalls and Stands~
   A haphazard path leads from north to south here, the exact 
boundaries of it changing and shifting like the banks of a river 
as the crowd of hawkers and merchants that set up stalls and 
carts along the unmarked trail start and finish with the rhythm 
of the day; at night, a predominantly yrcish presence can be seen 
amongst the various hagglers and purchasers, while when the sun 
is in the sky it is those of human descent crowding the area. At 
odd intervals, a procession of shackled slaves is led from the 
north, down along the path and herded by packs of slavers, 
heading to the auction block at the centre of the Arena Square.

Bustling City Square~
   Humanoids of varying shapes and sizes, from knobbly, 
wispy-bearded goblins to regal, straight backed Numenoreans, move 
about in the overlay of sound that flows over the Arena Square, 
every individual seeming intent on either hawking some ware or 
another, of receiving a verbal barrage of information from a 
hawker about some good. The thick press of people is 
occasionally broken up by a patrol of crest-helmed soldiers 
marching in unison, the path they cut through the scrum of 
denizens quickly collapsing again as the mercantile nature of the 
Arena Square takes over once more.

Numenorean Corner of the Arena Square~
   The massive stone edifice of the Arena rises up to the west, 
towering above all in the Square built before it and casting the 
western edge of the area a gloom well before the hours of dusk. 
Constructed to the east of the implacable stone wall is a number 
of buildings, the lower floors established as business set with 
expensive gilded windows whilst the upper floors seem like 
dwellings for families. The great crowd and the endless din it 
produces is somewhat reduced in this corner of the Square, the 
sombre presence of crest-helmed figures of the Black Watch 
enforcing the sensibilities of the not uncommon Black Numenoreans 
that dwell here.

Path Through the Square Leading East and West~
   An invisible line can be observed in the populace of the Arena 
Square here, an unmarked boundary drawn in the mass of unwashed 
humans and brutish orcs that push through the area. Northwards, 
the numbers of goblins and other yrckin thin, an unspoken 
agreement due to the thickening mongrel human presence. 
Likewise, to the south of the thin thoroughfare that leads from 
east to west, the thickness of orcs and goblins grows heavily, 
the curses and shouts generated from that direction of a darker, 
more brutish tongue than that employed elsewhere in the Arena 
Square. To the west, the massive Arena complex rises up above 
all else in the square.

Cacophonous Arena Square~
   From the mad braying of live animals all too well aware of 
their fate within the bloody markets of the Arena Square, to the 
screamed shouts and haggling of the human, goblin and orcish 
merchants and buyers that seem to fill every gap of space on the 
packed dirt ground, a great rolling mass of noise hangs heavy 
over this bustling hive of activity within Minas Morgul. During 
the day, a looming shadow is cast over the square, during the 
early hours from the tall buildings on the eastern edge, and 
during the afternoon by the massive stone edifice of the Arena to 
the west. At night, lanterns and torches blaze, lighting the 
area with dozens of bobbling globes of yellow-white, coming from 
the tops of the merchant stalls and carts.

Orc-Patrolled Corner of the Arena Square~
   Burly orcs patrol the Arena Square here, the task of ensuring 
a degree of peace is kept amidst the screaming method of trade 
conducted in Minas Morgul divided up amongst the various clans, 
metalskin-clad uruks ending many a dispute with a quick fist to 
the face of the offenders before going about their way. Teeming 
below the high-held heads of these brutal peacekeepers are the 
dark-skinned, shifty-eyed goblins of the city, clambering 
sometimes on all fours as they engage in a brisk trade of all 
manner of junk and scrap in varying tones of excited screeching. 
To the west, the Arena wall rises up, but in all other directions 
the Arena Square continues on.

Amidst the Orcish Stalls and Stands~
   Numerous twisting trails running past the stalls and stands 
run by scarred, and in many cases, crippled orcs and goblins 
allows one to make their way through this section of the Arena 
Square, almost forcing one to move in constant contact with the 
darker, more twisted denizens of Minas Morgul; however, on 
occasion, a procession of Harads or Numenoreans has a path beaten 
away from the commonfolk by either the disciplined soldiers of 
the Dervish or the elite enforcers of the Black Watch.

Slaving Section of the Arena Square~
   While much slaving is carried out about the raising platform 
to the north, the steady trade of unfortunate humans and goblins 
conducted here is far from negligible, many of the burly men and 
orcs standing about with their hands wrapped tight about a number 
of chains attached to thick collars on the necks of slaves. Save 
from the occasional mad scream or painful howl from a disobedient 
piece of chattel, the great hubbub that fills the square is from 
the bartering and bargaining conducted amongst the slavers and 
buyers, each humanoid here eager to drive the best deal.

Thriving Segment of the Arena Square~
   Named for the hulking presence of the massive stone structure 
that rises to the west on the other side of this enlarged space 
of packed dirt, the Arena Square is the nexus of much of Minas 
Morgul's trade, numerous merchants crammed into rickety stalls 
and shaky stands screaming loudly about their various goods and 
services on other to the vastly varied crowd that shuffles 
through. From feral humans dressed in furs and leathers to 
looming orcish warriors clad in armour, all commerce undertaken 
in this southeastern corner of the Arena is under the gaze of the 
Haradrim Silvermoon Dervish, the dark-hued soldiers keeping a 
relative degree of order.

Outside a Gaming Den in the Arena Square~
   A row of large houses built from dark stone and strong wood 
rise up to the east, rather drab in appearance save one somewhat 
more expansive than the rest, the outside walls painted garish 
colours of blue and white. At all hours of the day and night, 
sounds of raucous cheering burst out from behind the wooden door, 
noticeable even amidst the great din of merchant trade that takes 
place in the Arena Square. In all directions save the east the 
Arena Square expands.

A Rock-Walled Edge of Arena Square~
   A pungent smell of leather and chemicals issues from the 
building to the south, mingling with the general stench that 
hangs in the air. It has not kept peddlers from setting up 
awnings supported by poles along the southern wall, however, and 
this area of the square is just as crowded and busy as the rest. 
The building seems to be hewn out of the solid rock wall that 
runs from east to west, a grimy canvas covering its entrance.

Yrcish Segment of the Arena Square, North of a Crowded Bar~
   Small circles of orcs and goblins form about various pits 
hacked into the dirt packed earth of the Arena Square where fires 
blaze and merchants hawk their wares, bestial grunts and bellows 
carrying out amongst the yrckin as they conduct their trade of 
everything from grotesque foodstuffs to slaves both human and 
goblin in nature. While this area is predominantly populated by 
the darker, more stunted breed of Minas Morgul's population, no 
small number of humans can be seen to walk through the orcish 
crowds, and to the east the number of goblins quickly thins out. 
The Arena Square halts to the south, a sheer wall of stone 
preventing progress in that direction, yet many orcs have taken 
up residence in crude caves hacked out from the rock and covered 
with animal hides.

Entrance to the Half-Orc Hovels~
   This oval shaped space of dark dirt is bordered on all sides 
by quickly constructed tents and shanties, populated mainly by 
sloping-browed, slanted-eye half orcs, this squalid area of 
hovels a dumping ground for many of the unwanted half-breeds 
spawned in the dark, sordid nature of life in Minas Morgul. 
Little garbage clutters this single dusty street as it winds its 
way from a narrow gap between a stone building and the southern 
wall of Morgul to the west, instead much of the refuse and waste 
that comes naturally to such a dismal neighbourhood seemingly 
reused by the desperately poor denizens gathered here.

Past Squalid Caves Dug Into the Wall of Morgul~
   As this broad trail of dirt snakes from the north to west, it 
passes by a number of shallow caves hacked out by crude 
implements from the southern wall of Minas Morgul, tattered 
drapes and curtains set across many of the cavities wherein 
families of halfbreeds are raised, misshapen eyes glaring out 
from the dark holes at those that move through the squalid 
hovels. On the northern side, rickety extensions of rotting wood 
have been erected against the stone wall of a large, 
burn-blackened building, the shaky shelters swaying slightly in 
any wind more fierce than a gentle breeze.

Half-Breed Infested Street~
   Almost all of the wretched, filth-covered creatures gathered 
about this enlargened space of road shaded from the north by a 
large stone building and from the south back the rock walls of 
Morgul appear neither human nor orcish in origin, but of a 
twisted mix between the two species, deformed children mewling 
and screaming out from the squalor while lumpy-headed, scrawny 
men move to and fro through the hovels. The street, composed of 
little but scuffed dirt, takes a sharp turn to the south, while 
east it narrows down until a small gap between the building and 
the wall.

The 'Splintered Skull' Bar~
   Rough-hewn stone steps lead down into the Skull bar, where 
unwashed humans, brutish goblins, wary half-breeds and any other 
number of denizens, slaves and citizens of Minas Morgul crowd 
into the dark confines of the Splintered Skull, the large, 
circular stone cavern hacked away from black rock of the 
mountains surrounding the city. A constant hubbub of coarse and 
guttural voices echos about the stone walls, bellows of greeting, 
mirth, anger and drunkenness sounded out within the interior of 
the bar as burly, bare-chested orcs carry drinks to the mongrel 
and orc patrons clustered on the wide benches that run about the 
round tables of stone. Blackened oak trunks are sunk into the 
stone floor, supporting a huge wooden frame above the patrons, 
with blood-stained beams sunk into holes dug out of the cavern 
wall and held in place by huge rusting brackets. Large rock 
steps lead up through a wide hatch in the south west corner of 
the bar. Arranged on the walls above the heads of the crowd are 
numerous trophies of war, picked-clean skulls and tattered 
banners spaced between the occasional blazing torch, attached to 
the oaken pillars, that provides but a dim, flickering lightly 
into the cavern.

   This small closet is covered with shelves and racks of all

occasional goblin serving slave moves in and out of the narrow

A Cramped Storage Room~
   Dull grey in colour, four walls of stone form a perfect 
square, with the same, smooth stone forming the floor and 
enclosing this room with a room that mirrors the floor. This 
room is cool and ideal for the storage food stuffs and drinks. A 
small wooden door has been set in the wall to the north, and the 
room has been lit by a pair of scones positioned upon either side 
of the door.

Open Yard Sprawling Between Stone Buildings~
   This yard looks large enough to easily accomodate a dozen 
people within it, and is fashioned of left over land out of the 
numerous black-stoned buildings that rise up all about it, barred 
shutters looking down from the second and third levels. The hard 
earth of the yard is covered in a shadow throughout the day, save 
when the sun burns directly overhead, and at night is near pitch 
black. From the south, the faint buzz of many voices screaming 
and shouting drift in, floating over the tops of the buildings. 
Heavy doors of scratched oak lead north and east.

Stone-walled Backroom~
   The four walls of this room are fashioned of a coarse, dark 
stone, the rocks of a rough, yet irregular size, fitting together 
with many small gaps and set not too far apart from one another. 
No windows breach the stone confines of the room here, granting 
the air a somewhat stagnant quality to it, yet this is dispelled 
by the occasional breeze from above; the slight wind leads down 
from a narrow wooden staircase that leads through a pale, 
cedar-planked roof. North and south, a pair of matching, squad, 
scarred oak doors open inwards.

   Pale, unmellowed cedar wood fashioned in a mediocre manner 
forms the top floor of the building, the ceiling, floor and walls 
all unpainted and raw. On the northern side of the room, three 
holes have been cut into the wall, covered with heavy, 
iron-barred shutters, offering a glimpse down onto the shambling 
humanoids that move along Slave Road below. A large hole in the 
south-easter corner of the room leads downwards onto a narrow 
staircase, into a stone room.

The Warg's Head Brewery~
   The black stone walls of this large, roughly square room give 
it a somber appearance. Twin oaken doors guard both north and 
south exits, and a massive warg skull is mounted above both, 
jutting out from the wall. Filled torch sconces lie in each of 
the four corners, sending flickering light across the dim and 
damp room. Battered shelves line the walls, bearing assorted 
bottles of alcohol. Underneath the shelves dark casks are lined 
up in an orderly fashion. At the southern edge of the room 
stands a short, L-shaped bar. Sounds of cracking whips and 
guttural commands of obedience filter in through the north, all 
part of the hustle and bustle of Slave Road.

colours, arranged in a seemingly random pattern that allows a lot 
of multicoloured light into the shopfront. The wares are 
arranged about the shop, sitting neatly and cleanly on shelves 
and benches of wood and brass. There is no counter as such, the 
entire shop acting as a display. The exit back to the street is 
covered with a beaded curtain that keeps flying insects out, and 
jingles lightly when the breeze blows. In the south-easternmost 
corner of the shop, a solid-looking door of oak can be seen.

path through the shelves leads to a sandstone staircase with an 
oaken railing, leading up to a heavy, iron-barred door facing 
eastwards. This room has no windows that lead to the outside,

   This open-plan, sandstone constructed building is fairly

Many Haradaic carpets and rugs are laid about the floor and 
walls, of good, but not lavish quality. On the northern wall, 
there are several long, unpaned windows that look out onto the 
street below, and the roof of the storefront below, angled 
towards the street for drainage. The room has adequate space for 
all but the most extravagantly minded individual.

dozen feet in any planar direction, with two small and wide 
windows up high to let in most of the light, and shutters to keep 
it out if desired. The floor has several haradaic carpets and 
rugs of modest quality thrown about, and there are many small 
trinkets of brass and ivory adorning the walls.

   This area is very modestly decorated, and seems quite

spacing of several sandstone benches topped with marble is 
further evidence of its utilitarian purpose. There is a single 
window that allows the area to ventilate on the western wall, 
most of the light even during the day being provided by small oil 
lamps mounted upon the walls.

Cluttered Backroom of the Tavern~
   This backroom is nothing more than the cavernous frontroom of 
the tavern hacked further out of the black rock mountains that 
surround Minas Morgul. The only light and air that creeps into 
the room is through the gaps in the thick, banded northern door. 
The room is roughly circular, moss growing freely along the stone 
ceiling, while the floor is filled with an assortment of debris; 
broken tankards, sticky alcohol stains, and other miscellaneous 
scraps of wood and metal. To the west, a drab curtain has been 
thrown over the wall, the cave extending south. A downward 
sloping passage has been cut out of the eastern wall.

Fur-Lined Cave~
   This rough cavern is lined with numerous furs, most clumped 
together to form nests, where the workers of the Splintered Skull 
bar rest and sleep when not beaten into working by their orkish 
task masters. The cavern is filled with the rough and rowdy 
noises of the northern tavern at all times of the night and day, 
and on occasion the gentle purring snore of a goblin.

In a Large Cave Lined with Old Barrels and Crates~
   This broad cave is ringed with dozens of old, broken barrels 
and crates, the vast majority smashed and splintered, iron nails 
heavily rusted, and the few that are in some shape inhabited by 
rats, spiders, or foul growths of mold. Despite this 
infestation, the smell in this cave is overpoweringly one of 
alcohol, causing the eyes to water slightly after any time here. 
Dark stains cover the floor. A gentle, curving trail leads 
upwards from the eastern wall, twisting about a few times as it 
leads up to the backroom, the rock floor there worn smooth.

Fighting Pit Above the Splintered Skull~
   High above the drunken masses, a massive pine-floored platform 
rests on sturdy beams. In the centre, a sizeable fighting pit 
has been set, sawdust, blood, bones and worse littering the 
ground. Nailed, stained lumber encloses the pit in a wall twice 
as high as the tallest uruk. Raised above the pit wall are a 
series of precariously angled triple-tiered wooden benches 
resting on dug-out rock, flanking five large chairs at the far 
end with armrests and cheaply-padded seats. Circling around the 
unprotected sheer drop into the pit is a narrow walkway, 
beginning at the southwestern trapdoor. A ladder is nailed 
securely to the pit wall, its bottom rungs gnawed and heavily 
notched. Allowing access for large creatures, a short tunnel 
leads out of the western side of the pit, angled steeply upwards 
into a large dug-out cave. There is access into one side of this 
through a small bolted door near the cave wall.

Hand-Hacked Cave East of the Pit~
   This cave has been crudely hacked out of the black rock 
mountains that surround this fortress. A few torches flicker, 
barely illuminating a narrow cave filled with cages, rotting meat 
and the stench of faeces. The rough stone floor is scattered 
with broken planks, bent rusting nails, chewed trays and 
shattered buckets. To the east, a gaping hole leads to the pit 
tunnel and a small banded door offers easy exit just outside the 
tunnel. On either side of the cave, cages are stacked close 
together, barrels and crates pushed in any available space and a 
single set of crude shelves set in the deepest, darkest corner.

Open Yard Surrounded by Drab Buildings, off the Arena Square~
   This narrow yard is formed of dusky, grainy dirt, hemmed in to 
the east and west by tall, dark-walled buildings that rise up 
high over the head, the windows boarded up and roofs naught but 
shattered tiles. The tattered remains of a wrough-iron gate 
trail across the southern border of the yard, serving at keeping 
the swelled crowds of the Arena Square out of this yard, passage 
over the gates a simple matter of stepping over their felled iron 
bars. A hut formed of stone is at the northern end of the yard.

Cramped, Open-Walled Stone Hut~
   This stone hut is of simple, ramshackle construction, yet 
sturdy enough to keep out the elements and instead render the 
room a comfortable cool temperature year round. The western wall 
is missing, instead an open hole leading out to a small yard 
occupied by a forge and furance. The roof is made of wooden 
beams overlapped with baked clay tiles, and the floor is simple 
dirt, though a hole cut out in the eastern side has been layered 
with wooden logs leading down in to a basement.

Rotted-Fence Bordered Outdoor Forge~
   A fence of rotting wood surrounds this large yard, the palings 
ill-repaired and undoubtably weak, but there is little need for 
the outdated fence; the black-stoned buildings that surround it 
to the north, west and south are built right against the edge. 
The air is heavy here with the stench of heavy metals, great heat 
radiating up from the metalsmithing apparatus positioned in the 
yard. On the southern side of the yard stands a rickety suppled 
closet haphazardly fashioned out of miscellaenous scraps of wood.

Underground, Dirt-Floored Bunk Room~
   The walls of this bunk room have been hacked out of the dirt 
underbelly of this section of Minas Morgul, and supported with 
crude wooden beams arranged horizontally about the length of the 
ovoid room. The centre is occupied by a pillar of dirt, a 
wood-framed staircase of earth leading up to the top level of the 
stone hut that sits above it. The occasional worm and 
underground insect can be seen worming its way through the room 
and in to the floor.

Tiny Supply Closet~
   This ramshackle huts serves as the supply storage for the

items upon them, ready to be carried out to the yard and offered 
for sale. The door opens to the north out on to the yard.

A Trim, Adequately Furnished Guest Bedroom~
   The location and decoration of this room make its purpose 
fairly self evident; that of a temporary room for guests of the 
household. With a largely unworn, but unadorned four-poster 
wooden bed, a high window to let in the morning's light, and few 
pieces of any furnishing appearing to have any sentimental value 
whatsoever, it is quite difficult to imagine anyone creating a 
permanent abode of this place. The ground consists of polished 
teak planks, fitted and laid with an artisan level of skill. The 
walls are a hearthy red brick, which gives the area a good deal 
of insulation when combined with the tiled roof. All in all, a 
comfortable, but utilitarian room.

A Small Private Stables~
   This squat, thatched building of wood seems to be some kind of 
stables, with several stalls of black-painted wood, a golden 
dragon emblazoned upon the door of each stall. All manner of 
ostler paraphernalia can be observed about this place, and 
although it is kept impeccably tidy, especially for a stable, its 
small size does little to lend a perspective of clutter-free 
organization.

A Modest Receiving Room with an Iron Spiral Staircase~
   The dominating feature of this high-roofed, open receiving 
room is a finely-wrought spiral staircase of iron, which begins 
in the southeastern corner of the room and leads up to the upper 
levels. This room, although adequately furnished with the 
fineries one would expect of a manor in the area, is not 
particularly lavish. A large, ornately-detailed metal plaque of 
a dragon breathing fire hangs above the doorway, and this 
particular symbol is a recurring feature of many of the 
furnishings. A large archway with a thick, draped curtain to the 
east leads towards a hall of some kind, and to the east there is 
a wooden door. In its own corner of the room, a several foot 
wide trapdoor seems to lead downwards.

A Small, Cluttered Kitchen~
   This kitchen almost seems to have been designed as an 
afterthought, with a vast amount of food-preparation equipment 
and devices pushed into a very small area. No matter whether or 
not it is in use, it always seems cluttered and claustrophobic, 
and the brick of the wall only serves to elevate the temperature 
to unbearable proportions when any cooking is taking place. A 
small cellar door is tucked away in the corner of the kitchen.

An Earthy, Underground Cellar~
   This cellar seems to have been dug into the earth beneath the 
manor above, the soil of the walls having been reinforced with a 
light timber of some description, which is somewhat worse for 
wear than it would have been when first installed. It is however 
relatively large for an earth cellar, and not overly dusty nor 
damp. There is a small set of retractable wooden steps that lead 
up to the cellar door above.

A Short, Narrow Corridor at the top of an Iron Spiral Staircase~
   From the top of the Iron Stair, a good deal of the Receiving 
Room below can be seen, and from here, a narrow corridor extends 
from the north to the south, with a door at either end. The 
walls are unadorned except for the lamps that provide their 
light, and this seems to be an area of private and familiar 
purposes for those who use them.

A Dank Stone Cellar~
   A series of old, granite steps lead down from the heavy cellar 
doors above, mid way along the southern wall of this fairly 
extensive stone basement. The floors and walls are made of large 
granite blocks, and the air down here has the foul stench of damp 
underground air, mixed with the deep, sanguinary smell of old 
blood and the acrid odour of human sweat and other even less 
pleasant odours. In the northern wall, a large, heavy iron door 
with several solid-looking locks can be observed.

with several cross bars and locks. The chamber is surprisingly 
absent of much of a smell.

A Moderately Large Hall~
   Opening up from a plain, curtained archway in the western 
wall, this hall is fairly large and high, the massive redwood 
support beams in the roof nearly two stories up. There are some 
few tapestries and other adornments on these worlds, including 
the ever-present golden dragon upon a black background. The 
floor here is made of highly polished teak planks, the walls a 
combination of stone brick and various woods. There are large 
lead glass windows from what would be the second story upwards 
nearly all the way around the hall, depicting many nefarious 
looking creatures of uncertain being.

A Cramped, Sludge-Floored Crevase~
   This crevase-like tunnel looks to have been chipped out of the 
black rock underbelly of Minas Morgul, barely wide enough for an 
uruk to squeeze through. Thick, muddy sludge dominates the 
bottom foot or so of the passage, occasionally a slow air-bubble 
forces its way up to the surface releasing the stank of sulphur. 
Droplets of putrid water dripple down the sides of tunnel, 
leaving slimy trails of filth before dropping down into the mud. 
The southern end of the passage elevates as a series of craggy 
crude stone steps jut up from the sludge leading futher in that 
direction.

   This chamber looks to have been mined out of the black rock 
underbelly of Minas Morgul, crude marks chipped into the dark 
stone walls. Set in the low, domed ceiling is a wooden trapdoor, 
while to the north a crude series of steps leads further down 
into the rock. The rough walls bear a thick residue of pale, 
grey slime which strings it way down to the floor. Eventually, 
the grime oozes its way north, slicking the steps and floor on 
the way.

#2North#0: The Armour Store 
#2East#0: General Goods, and Trade Goods (crafting tools, etc) 
#2West#0: Clothing and Jewelry 
#2Down#0: Slave Trading Block, Arena Square
#9Please note that Arena Square is in game, in Minas Morgul, and
once you have gone there, you will not be able to get back here.
Please finalize your pre-game purchases before entering.#0

The Armour Store~
   In this store you can buy armour of various kinds. Please 
note however that in Minas Morgul, there are very strict and 
heavy-handedly enforced policies regarding who can wear what 
kinds of armour. #9Under no circumstances should Goblins 
generally ever buy metal armour. If you do, it will almost 
certainly be taken from you once you get in game, and you will 
not be compensated.#0 

Mongrel humans should also be careful - Haradrim, Black 
Numenoreans, Dunlendings and Orcs all have a little more freedom 
but still should consider their purchase. Unclanned people of 
any kind are more or less completely unprotected from thieves and 
thugs.

A Slave Auction Block in the Center of the Square~
   Elevated above the bustling plaza, a large platform stands in 
the very center of the square. Slaves for sale are displayed 
upon it, and the auctioneer's voice rings out above the usual 
clamor to be heard by potential buyers. This is where the 
slavers' guild, the rough enclave of kidnappers and the orkish 
equivalent of businessmen, hold their annual slave auctions and 
help pay for the arena. Tables are set up all around the auction 
block for those witnessing to place their bids. The square 
continues to spread out in all directions.

Entry Hall of the Crypts~
   This large marble foyer serves as the entry hall to the 
Numenorean Crypts, the sight where countless generations of Black 
Numenoreans are buried in the numerous sealed tunnels that lead 
off the building in all directions. The interior of the hall is 
rather sparse, the floors and ceilings unadorned, but the walls 
are covered in runic script, some words close-set and 
insignficiant, others taking up nearly a foot in space. A set of 
grand doors made from polished oak lead out to the north.

objects. Along the walls shelves and racks have been securely 
placed and filled with all sorts of tools for every job required.
