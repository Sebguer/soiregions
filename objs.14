An ash-shafted shortspear with a head of flint lies here.~
   A long piece of ash has been painstakingly smoothed and sanded 
into the shaft of this shortspear, standing at about 
three-and-a-half feet tall. At the edge, nocked into the wood 
and fastened with strips of tanned leather, is a jagged, serrated 
head made of grey flint. The spear is unornamented and 
undecorated, lending it a utalitarian feel.

a hulking stone humanoid with a sour disposition~
A carved stone humanoid with a sour disposition looms here.~
   Made of a single, solid towering spire of granite, this 
humanoid carving is roughly the height of two and a half men. 
Its smoothly-sanded face glares outward, lifeless sunken sockets 
lurking beneath a sloped, glowering brow. An over-large nose 
juts out, hawkish and sharply-pointed, from its angular face. It 
sits on the forest floor, leaning against a towering oak tree, 
one foot curled underneath the other outstretched granite leg. 
Though inanimate, the fact that the monolithic statue grips a 
giant stone club tightly in its right hand would warrant a second 
look from all but the least superstituous of people.

A haunting carving is etched into a tree trunk here, weathered and old.~
   Carved out of the trunk of a tree, this haunting depiction of 
a humanoid is enough to give all but the least superstitious of 
peoples a nervous feeling. Roughly man height, the dead trunk of 
the tree has been stripped of bark and carved into a human-like 
shape. The shape, however, is warped and contorted, with its 
arms and legs wretchedly twisted into excruciating angles. The 
head is set low into the torso, its lifeless eyes wide open and 
its mouth twisted agape in agony. The entire carving is 
extremely weathered and old, perhaps as old as the tree itself.

A grey silken shirt has been left here.~
   The soft grey of this silk shirt only helps to add to the gleam
coming from its mirror-like surface. Spun of the finest thread, its
surface is smooth and perfectly sewn with tiny, even little stitches.
A scrolling embroidered pattern is carefully sewn on its upper sleeves
and collar, matching the scrollwork down the front opening that dances
along the buttons. It fits close to the body, but is light and airy,
with an ethereal and regal appearance.

be sharp and pointed, though it is difficult to tell from this

   This was once a building, perhaps some sort of cabin, but time 
and the elements have taken their toll on it, and now all that's 
left are a few partially-collapsed walls and a crumbling stone 
foundation. The entire structure is overgrown with weeds, making 
it difficult to tell where rooms once were. The logs used in its 
construction have mostly rotted away, some of them still visible 
beneath the thick vegetation. There is no sign of a roof, or of 
the people who abandoned this place.

to obtain entry at some point in the distant past.

   This broad-bladed, one-handed arming sword has seen better 
days. The metal of the blade proper is spotted with dull stains, 
its edges notched from use. The simple, straight hilt has been 
fashioned of silver, tarnished and dull - a length of sinew that 
was wrapped about the handle lies dry and tattered now, eaten 
away with age. A round, heavy pommel at the sword's end acts as 
a counterweight to balance its swing.

spur of granite that lies beneath it, its square edges weathered 
but undoubtedly firm. Though not particularly great in height, 
the sheer walls of the low tower are insurmountable from below, 
and, save a few narrow slits recessed into its upper lengths, no 
points of entry appear to have been bored into it. The turret's 
walls are grooved to imitate the look of brick, and are capped 
with high crenellation. Four great stone eagles, spread-winged 
and majestic, have been chiselled into the rock beneath the upper 
edge of each wall, each pointing in a different cardinal 
direction. Occasionally, a bit of movement can be spied at the 
turret's crown, though it is impossible to get a clear sight of 
the top from this point of view.

archaic sigils, vaguely reminiscent of runic Cirth script. The 
etchings are dusted in silver, now spotted and devoid of their

a series of strange runic inscriptions~
A series of strange runic inscriptions line the walls of the antechamber.~
   Strange sigils of some ancient mode line the walls of the 
chamber here. They appear to have been meticulously engraved 
with a fine chisel. The antique runes that comprise the 
inscriptions are worn and faded in many places. They seem 
primitive, and to anyone with a working knowledge of scripts, 
would resemble ancient Cirth.

scabbard DRUADAN_TOMB elaborate gold-plated METAL~
an elaborate, gold-plated scabbard~
An elaborate, gold-plated scabbard lies here.~
   This scabbard, fit for holding a sword of middling size, is 
finely and elaborately crafted. The frame itself is fashioned of 
a light wood, unadorned on the inside. The outward surface of 
the scabbard is bolted with many overlapping plates of gold, 
which appear somewhat dull, having lost their former lustre with 
age. Many detailed carvings have been carefully worked into the 
ancient metal, illustrating marvelous scenes of torch-lit caverns 
and rocky cliffs. The scabbard appears to have been unused, and, 
though clearly old, is in a remarkably pristine condition.

A large bronze key has been discarded here.~
   This key is made of a thick bronze that has had three teeth 
molded into it to fit inside of the lock. The handle of the key 
is long enough for a hand to wrap around easily and a hole molded 
into one end so that it can be slipped onto a keyring.

axe crescent blade finely sharpened POF_LREC_HC METAL~
a finely-sharpened double-headed axe~
A one-handed axe with two crescent blades lays here.~
   This axe, clearly designed for the use of one hand, has a long 
handle, perhaps a little bit bigger then a grown man's forearm. 
Crafted from wood, it still manages to retain a incredibly 
well-balanced weight to it. Darkly dyed leather has been tied 
around the handle, offering a superior grip. While clean and 
polished, there are obvious nicks in it from what one would 
assume to be years of use. It leads up to a double 
crescent-headed axehead, forged from steel. The flat has an 
engraving of a bear, up on it's hind paws as though threatening 
an intruder, while the blade itself is incredibly sharp, a clear 
sign of care despite the apparent age of the weapon.

   Made of lustrous silvery-grey silk, these leggings are light 
and sewn to fit snugly to the wearer's legs. Delicate 
leaf-details have been embroidered along the hem and down the 
legs in gold thread, and the hue of the leggings seems to change 
with the light.

cabin BEACON_GUARDHOUSE_BYEONWE small sturdy OTHER~
a small, sturdy cabin~
Nestled within the evergreen sea is a small, sturdily-built cabin encircled by a stone fence.~
   This small cabin had been sturdily-constructed from a number 
of thick pine logs. Evidence of skilled hands having compiled 
this building are apparent, from the wood-cutting to the perfect 
symmetry of its sides and angles. Though not a great work of 
aesthetics, this cabin is clearly capable of weathering the 
passing of time and is set on a solid foundation. Entry is 
possible from the northern face through an imposing oaken door 
braced with iron and windows peer out, barricaded with thick oak 
shutters, to the north, east, and west. It is surrounded by a 
thick stone fence which is approximately five feet in height. 
Within the stone barrier is a small, enclosed stable that sits on 
the cabin's eastern side.
