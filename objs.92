a dried-out compress~
A dried-out compress is discarded here.~
   Dried-out and stiff, this compress is now useless. The linen 
wrappings are stained from the herbal remedies within and no 
longer flexible. It still has a faintly herbal smell which is 
not entirely unpleasant, but is largely unidentifiable.
