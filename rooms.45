A Four-Way Intersection at the Boar's Head Tavern~
   This main thoroughfare of town sits intersecting four major 
roads that lead off in the cardinal directions towards the low 
stone walls of the village. Set at the preeminent spot of this 
haphazard town center is the Orrs' Boar's Head Inn, its oft 
puffing chimney filling the square with the scent of mead and ale 
and the sounds of gossip and gambling at all hours. A large, 
brightly painted green front door depicts a fierce, tusk-faced 
boar's head, where one could surely #6enter#0 the #6inn#0 or 
stand back and get a better #6view#0 of the #6structure#0. A 
large wooden palisade has been constructed around the periphery 
of the intersection, blocking passage north, east, and south. 
One could #6go#0 in any of these directions, in order to climb to 
the platforms above.

The Boar's Head Inn~
   This inn commons, though well kept, could see some cosmetic 
improvement, the high wooden slat and dried peat ceiling needing 
a new coat of paint to match the the strong, dark-stained timbers 
of the floorboards and contrasting whitewashed walls. A 
fireplace of simple river-stone construction allows for warmth 
and light in the cold and dark, while a long wooden bar and 
various tables provide sitting space for a mill of patrons that 
sit gambling and gossiping loudly at nearly all hours. A set of 
slate and wooden stairs lead to the rental rooms above, a 
blue-painted door allows inn staff to #6enter#0 the #6kitchen#0

customer base of the tavern to enter and #6leave#0 the #6inn.#0

Heol Gwern Before a Brewery~
   To the east and west you can see the sides of old buildings. 
The building to the east looks more residential, while recent 
repairs to the western door have reopened the old brewery for 
business, a new iron bell set into the frame at average shoulder 
height. The dirt road, Heol Gwern, continues north and south.

Heol Plas Before a Housing Complex~
   One large structure dominates the northern side of this 
thoroughfare, a generous house-shaped building with a relatively 
patched peat and a flat slate stone tiled roof. Despite the 
vague attempts at improvements to the structure, thick, thorny 
vines clinging to the wooden plank walls and the decaying mortar 
of the whitewashed foundation rocks still threaten the complex 
with impending oblivion. A similiar structure, formerly 
stationed towards the east already suffered its fate, tumbling 
into the street previously blocking further access to Heol Plas. 
Enough of the rubble has been cleared for passage to continue on 
to the east.

clay and sand wafts into the street from two shops that have been 
rebuilt enough to be worked by someone.

itself appears to be in passing fair condition and a stone 
building extends along the southern side of the road. On the 
northern end, an overgrown empty lot takes up the corner. 
Further down the thoroughfare are more buildings in varying 
degrees of disrepair. Blocking the intersection to the west is a 
large wooden palisade, interrupted only by an iron sliding door 
about the span of two men.

Tafam before the heavy, rusted iron gateway leading westwards to 
the riverside docks. Broken cobblestones, toppled buildings, and 
various other refuse and debris clog the avenues leading north 
and south, leaving the turn eastwards the only available pathway. 
The eerie air of the abandoned graveyard visible towards the 
southeast, and the state of disrepair of the area combine to give 
this junction an air of general malaise. The street to the east 
has been blocked by a wooden palisade, and one could #6climb#0 
the #6palisade#0 to reach the platform above.

worn, dark timbers sits precariously on its lot. The back of the 
building seems to have settled into the ground about six inches, 
while the front of the building has settled nearly a foot. This 
gives the building both a rakish and uneasy look. Heol Bedd

Heol Tafam Before The Boar's Head Inn~
   The heady scent of fresh northern stout and the sweet aroma of 
honey mead often travel on the frequent breezes wafting from the 
tavern square back towards the east. Just removed from the main 
intersection, this space appears comparatively desolate and 
unoccupied, looking down a street of forsaken shops with the 
overshadowing presence of the nearby graveyard. Heol Tafam 
travels westwards to the town gates and beyond the docks. 
Visible to the east is a large palisade that seems to stretch 
across the majority of the intersection.

A Short Hallway~
   This slightly cramped hallway ends in the slopped end of the 
inn's lofty ceiling, creating a tight feeling to the air from the 
small nature of the space and the proximity to a section of the 
musty peat-moss ceiling that hangs low from above. The 
whitewashed walls continue from the south, one side of the wall 
displaying some hastily sketched hunting scene of rather poor 
artistic quality. Two brightly-painted doors lead off to the 
inn's lodging rooms beyond, their wooden surfaces looking 
worse-for-wear, while the hallway returns back towards the 
stairwell and the rowdy inn commons to the south.

Inside the Green Suite~
   Obvious care went into the crafting of this room from stone 
and timbers in a long-forgotten time, but the space now bears the 
signs of ages of wear, tear, and abandonment. In several places, 
stones and their mortar crumble away from the wall, some 
haphazard patching keeping them barely intact, something easily 
ruined by too much touching. Hung upon the walls are several 
green tapestries of worn but once valuable quality, that do 
little to insulate the room against the near constant noises 
filtering in from the inn below. Closely built to the sod roof 
above, the smell of earth and damp fills the room, combining with 
those filting in with the heat of the kitchen below.

The Boar's Blue Suite~
   Obvious care went into the crafting of this room from stone 
and timbers in a long-forgotten time, but the space now bears the 
signs of ages of wear, tear, and abandonment. In several places, 
stones and their mortar crumble away from the wall, some 
haphazard patching keeping them barely intact, something easily 
ruined by too much touching. Hung upon the walls are several 
blue tapestries of worn but once valuable quality, that do little 
to insulate the room against the near constant noises filtering 
in from the inn below. Closely built to the sod roof above, the 
smell of earth and damp fills the room, combining with those 
filting in with the heat of the kitchen below.

Southwest Town Orchards~
   Rows of trees of varying types were planted here long ago, 
though all is overgrown. One must walk with care, as the ground 
is littered with fallen fruit in varying stages of decay, hiding 
under the tall prarie that grows now, beneath the trees. Along 
the border of the orchard, a tall hedgerow blocks your view west 
of the buildings along Heol Blodau, and blocks your view of Heol 
Readmanu to the south.

Entrance to the Town Orchards~
   This is an overgrown lot. A few tumbled mounds of fallen, 
smooth river rock, were once public seating areas. Two short 
rows of dishevelled trees to the west, and three short rows of 
small trees to the east, mark where overgrown paths lead into 
more of the orchards. To the north, a row of fallen fencing lays 
before a row of old willows, that block the view beyond.

impossible, as the weeds block most progress. There are some 
beehives south of the trees, that you can nearly reach when 
walking. The town may have been abandoned, but the hives are 
active. The bees did not care that men were absent.

A Corner of a Graveyard~
   A small rise here marks the northwestern corner of this 
cemetery. Though not as large as the tombstones along the 
cobble-stone path, these tombstones are still a step above a 
simple grave marker. Tall grasses and ivy have taken over these 
tombstones as well. Several tops of tombstones can be seen lying 
in the grasses, littered about and forgotten. The lack of trees 
in this area lend to a barren and forgotten atmosphere.

The Northern Entrance to an Unkempt Graveyard~
   A roughly cut and stained cobblestone path leads from a gate 
to the north to a small intersection to the south. Lined on 
either side of this path and stretching in both directions lie 
many tombstones. The majority of the tombstones are broken or 
crumbling, particularly the simple ones. Along the path finer 
tombstones can be seen. These are generally not chipped but due 
to the general overgrown state of the graveyard they are often 
covered in vines or with tall grasses. A few withered trees line 
either side of the path. Countless years of neglect have 
rendered what could be beautiful shade trees to broken trunks 
with dead limbs and foliage at the trunk.

A Shaded Corner of a Graveyard~
   Pushed back away in the northeastern corner, this area is 
almost completely overgrown with trees, untrimmed bushes, and 
overgrown trees. Broken limbs and shattered tombstones litter 
the ground around the many graves. Simple and unadorned, the 
tombstones in this area seem to continue on toward the south 
toward the fence in the distance. Flanked on the west by an old 
cobblestone path and on the right by a wrought iron fence, this 
area is set apart from the rest of the graveyard unmarked or 
simple tombstones being the characteristic grave marker.

Entering a Graveyard Along a Small Path~
   A roughly cut cobblestone path leads from a gate to the west 
to an small intersection to the east. Narrow and run down with 
time, this path leads through an obviously neglected graveyard. 
To the north and south large stones, many of them broken, mark 
the graves of the dead. Weeds and grasses have begun to take 
over the fields of the dead, choking out even the most stubborn 
of bushes in this area of the graveyard. Only a single tree can 
be spotted, though only the trunk remains planted firmly in the 
ground on the northern side of the path just inside the gate.

In the Center of a Graveyard at the Intersection of Two Small Paths~
   A path coming from the west meets one running north to south 
through a small square here. Like both paths, the intersection 
is paved with dark cobblestones, beaten smooth over time. 
Between the stones underfoot weeds and grass force their way 
through. Along the eastern side of this small square are rows of 
simple graves. However, to the northwest and southwest the 
largest tombs in the graveyard can be seen. Though time and 
neglect has taken their toll on them as well, several of the 
finer markers having significant chunks missing.

Alongside a Small Path in a Graveyard~
   Small and often unmarked and broken tombstones mark the graves 
of those dead to the east of a small intersection in this area. 
Tall grasses and weeds choke the area and cover many of the 
tombstones, particularly those that have been broken and are now 
little more than stone stubs. A wrought iron fence runs north to 
south along the eastern edge of the graveyard. To the north and 
south are similar graves, simple and unadorned stones use to mark 
the final resting place of the dead.

On a Small Hill Within a Graveyard~
   Tucked away in the southwest corner of the graveyard, lined to 
the west and south by an old wrought-iron fence, this area of the 
graveyard is not unlike the rest overgrown and damaged. Without 
a path through the area the gravestones make up neat rows running 
from north to south. Not a single stone has been spared by the 
weather, and only a few have remained unbroken through the years 
of evident neglect.

A Southern Entrance to a Graveyard Along a Small Path~
   Broken cobble-stones and weeded seams make up the narrow path 
underfoot. Leading from north to south this run-down stone trail 
leads from north to south through an unkempt graveyard. Lined 
mostly with weeds and overgrown shrubs, those graves that can be 
seen on the sides of the path are often broken and decayed. Most 
of them bearing names and images that have long since become too 
damaged to discern. Few birds fly overhead, leaving this 
graveyard feeling abandoned.

   The smallest and least decorative stones mark the graves here. 
Years of weather have erased any marks that may have once 
appeared on the gravestones. The grass and shrubs are overgrown 
and uncut, hiding many of the stones. Sticks and brush break 
underfoot as no set trail marks any path through the graves here. 
A single tree with untrimmed and low hanging brianches sits near 
the southern fence, its roots breaking the earth in several 
places.

Grayson's Masonry~
   This shop smells of stone and clay. There is a large 
workspace and a sturdy stone counter lines the southern part of 
the shop. Large piles of rocks and other masonry items are kept 
in large bins throughout the shop.

Traveller's Smith Crafts~
   Signs of recent repair show upon the walls and floor of this 
shop, replaced mortar showing bright white against the faded grey 
river stones that form the lower half of the walls, and newly 
placed timbers lending a faintly fragrant smell of sap where they 
stand next to old, weathered ones. The roof, of slate tiles, 
protects the interior against the frequent wind and rain, keeping 
it dry and secure. Standing before a door into the back of the 
shop is an old, hard-used counter, splintered and cracked in some 
places, but still serviceable enough.

The Bearded Hammer~
   A single rack, bereft of any equipment, and an empty, 
forgotten bin, lying on its side, are all that remain of what was 
once here in this large, spare room. The rack was designed to 
hold weaponry, and the traces of oil remaining on its wood 
proclaim the likelihood of there having been of iron or steel.

A Path Between Shops~
   An overgrown cobblestone path leads north and south between 
shop fronts. The backs of the buildings are covered with vines 
and in some cases even some mould is present near the base of the 
buildings. To the north the thoroughfare of Heol Plas and the 
large housing complex can be seen. Further south, more shops 
line the pathway.

movement to the south. The overgrown path leads back to the 
west.

A Path Between Shops~
   Overrun with weeds, this weathered cobble path turns here 
through a series of abandoned buildings. Looking like old shop 
fronts, signs hang from the buildings, the paint and designs worn 
blank over time and weather. The peat roofs of the buildings lie 
in terrible repair, leaving huge holes leading into some of the 
buildings and non-existent on others altogether. The doors of 
the shops have long since been boarded up and without great 
efforts to repair, the area would be uninhabitable.

main thoroughfare here. The cobbles are worn and overrun with 
weeds almost to the point of not being seen at all. Several 
stone buildings line the sides of the path, their peat roofs 
fallen in from years of neglect. Some of the buildings' 
foundations have shifted, leaving large cracks running up and 
down some of the walls, breaking the mortar holding the stones in 
place.

of this abandoned shop. Broken glass bottles and nick-knacks

The beams of the ceiling have miraculously survived and the peat

An Overgrown Yard and Gypsy Wagon~
   Set into an abandoned field off the side of the road, a 
garishly painted gypsy wagon its wheels covered in fresh dirt and 
grass attesting to its recent arrival. Waist high weeds make 
crossing the distance to the wagon difficult for all but the most 
determined, though two nanny goats tethered to the front of the 
wagon with long red-dyed ropes begin to make short work of the 
grasses, their bleats and calls filling the yard. Pungent smells 
float on strong breezes from the inside of the wagon, fixing with 
the flora and fauna to produce a unique aroma to the area.

Deeper Inside a Healer's Tent~
   The back of this healer's tent, seperated from the main tent 
space is barely large enough for a man of average build to 
comfortably move around, a hammock bed suspended by the wooden 
frame of the tent to provide a sleeping space for the tent's 
regular occupant during the odd hours a healer manages. Dark and 
musty, this space seems cave-like and close, a primitive kind of 
sleeping quarters, decorated with abandoned bits of feather, 
bone, and various colored ribbons.

worn from time. The shelves against the back wall are drooping

Guild Mess and Meeting Hall~
   Situated between the main door leading to Heol Gild and the 
water-drained farmland behind the Guild House, dirt often finds 
its way all over the wooden floor of this room, giving it a dirty 
and slightly unkempt appearance. The smell of the peat-moss roof 
above combined with the scents of the farmyards and the aromas of 
the nearby kitchen clash in a dissonance of smells, only further 
perpetrated during the warmer months. The lime whitewash on the 
river rocks forming the base of the building flakes in a several 
placing, producing a fine powder along the floorboards that 
appears snow-like, only adding to the constant floor grime.

An old stone counter sits before the shopkeep, its surface 
heavily stained with a plethora of deep dye-marks. The floor 
boards squeak and pop underneath as employees or customers walk 
about the room, though a very old, natty-looking rug soaks up a

mostly flecked away, allowing the dark wood underneath to be

permanent blood stains, that the sprinkled sand ground into the 
surface did little to help. Rubble crumbles from the mortar wall 
further littering the location next to the worn, well-used stone

Roots and Taters~
   Large crates of produce are stacked in aisles throughout this 
shop. The walls of the shop are worn and plaster falls from the 
ceiling periodically, showing small cracks beneath. The peat 
roof is functional but needs some work to keep the weather out. 
Although the shop is functioning, it is far from being in top 
condition and could use a great deal of work.

The Guild Collective's Creamery ~
   Recently completed, river rocks and mortar construct this 
building extention. An amusing whitewash and black painted 
pattern, reminiscent of the creature that provides this shop its 
livelihood decorates the shop to about six foot high, the rest of 
the wall blending into the wooden and sod roof above. Dark 
wooden boxes lined with thin slate panels anticpate jars and 
bottles of fresh dairy goods. A door along the back wall allows 
one with permission to #6enter#0 the #6storeroom#0, the open 
archway allowing return to the central shop.

The Foyer of the Housing Complex~
   Cracked white marble makes up the floor of the foyer. The 
walls, a faded pale green tint, remain relatively straight, 
though there are small cracks in the ceiling stones where the 
foundation has clearly shifted. Square arches lead off to the 
north, east and west. A dusty, cobwebbed wooden chandelier 
swings idly in the center of the room.

A Short Hallway Leading to the Apartments~
   This hallway leads off off the foyer to the south, the marble 
floor continuing on through the space up to the door set in the 
northern wall. Rusted sconce holders hang on either side of the 
doorway and at regular intervals down the hall, giving off ample 
light when lit. The walls of the hallway are painted a dingy 
white. The ravages of time do not appear to have worn on this 
space as much as the others.

A Comfortable Sitting Room~
   Unpainted wooden rafters stretch across the ceiling, and seem 
to still be in decent repair. The walls, painted a dusty yellow 
color have chips peeling away from the wall. On the western side 
of the room a large window looks out onto an overgrown yard and a 
vacant lot beyond. Hardwood floors run the length of the room 
and are covered in dusty, worn rugs. The furnishings looked like 
they were once pleasant and comfortable, though now appear aged 
from neglect.

A Simple Common Kitchen and Eating Area~
   Cream-colored paint flakes off of the walls, and large 
water-spots can be seen through the plaster walls around the 
ceiling. Dust-covered kitchen furniture collects cobwebs 
throughout the room. The smooth stone floor has cracks breaking 
the bricks and mortar and the whole room appears weather-worn, 
dank and musty, but looks like it's been swept recently. The 
scent of rotted, moldy food fills the air.

An East-West Hallway~
   This hallway is dim and painted in a dark rust colored paint. 
Though it looks worn, the paint has not peeled from the walls. A 
thick carpet lines the floor. The hallways runs east-west 
opening into private apartments all along the way. Simple iron 
sconces hang at intervals between the doors, providing a subdued 
light to the hallway. A large staircase takes up the center of 
the hallway here, leading to the upper floors.

The Bear Apartment~
   This room was obviously well-crafted, though it now bears the 
signs of many years of wear and tear. In places it appears that 
stones have come loose and been replaced in a shoddy manner and 
in others wood supports are visible within gaping holes in the 
stone, but overall the room looks to be in decent condition. 
Hung upon the walls and covering the worst of the crumbling 
masonry are several tapestries, somewhat aged and worn but 
obviously of quality craftsmanship. The only window that exists 
in the southern wall is now boarded over from the outside, the 
remnants of broken glass panes still clinging to the frame.

The Elk Apartment~
   This room was obviously well-crafted, though it now bears the 
signs of many years of wear and tear. In places it appears that 
stones have come loose and been replaced in a shoddy manner and 
in others wood supports are visible within gaping holes in the 
stone, but overall the room looks to be in decent condition. 
Hung upon the walls and covering the worst of the crumbling 
masonry are several tapestries, somewhat aged and worn but 
obviously of quality craftsmanship. The only window that exists 
in the southern wall is now boarded over from the outside, the 
remnants of broken glass panes still clinging to the frame.

Second Story Landing~
   A dim hallway leads off east and west from the landing. The 
walls of this floor have been pained a cream color and sconces 
hang from it at regular intervals, providing a dim light. There 
are apartments both north and south off of the landing and along 
the hallway as well. A thick rug lines the floor and the 
staircase dominates this landing, leading both up to the third 
level and back down to the first level.

lies to the north leading into the private bedroom. There is a 
dusty chandelier hanging over the table and gives off ample light 
to fill the room. A well-worn carpeting covers the floor from 
wall to wall in a comparable color to the walls.

Atop the Northern Gatehouse~
   The rampart underfoot is crumbled, but solid enough if you 
step with care. The wall has been broken away, however, and you 
are exposed northwards. There was once a wooden roof, and a 
railing to the south, that defined the battlement, and that is 
missing completely. Gazing northward all about, you see grasses 
and standing water. The road that leads out from the town 
disappears immediately into the marsh. Far off to the north, 
along a line of trees, you can see a glint of water in the 
sunlight, as the Nindalf winds through the marshes to join the 
Great River Anduin.

   There is a break in the rampart to the east, where the wall 
has either been struck by an engine of war or has been smashed 
in. The railing and roof are torn away entirely. You must keep 
to the south edge by the wall, as the footing is treacherous. 
The only safe path leads to the west. To the north you can see 
marshlands, and to the south, the rooftop of the stables.

At the Southeastern Corner of the Walls~
   Here in this corner, there is a wooden roof overhead, and 
railing, and while you cannot see outward, you have a good view 
of the town to the northwest. Trees and parkland can be seen in 
the distance, but up close, you see buildings with missing roofs 
and caved in walls.

Along the Southern Wall Passing a Market~
   It is perilous to climb here among the broken stones that once 
made up the wall. Bits of burned timber and scorched stone give 
indication as to what occurred sometime in the past. To the 
north, you can see much of what was once this wall lying in the 
street below. To the south, you are completely exposed to anyone 
or anything on the meadow by the banks of the Great River.

rubble to the east. The rampart continues west, and appears much 
safer in that direction.

bank, without any detail. You can hear the water as it flows 
past. You cannot see the near bank. If there was ever a 
shooting platform here enabling you to have a downward sightline, 
it is long gone.

Inside a Dark, Dank Crypt~
   With enough height for the tallest of men to stand upright, 
this dark crypt has been left to the ravages of time. Old stone, 
once standing strong has been left to crumble and shatter under 
its own weight. Four pillars of pale stone rise up, barely 
supporting the heavy ceiling above, many showing cracks. A thick 
sheet of dust and cobwebs cover nearly every surface and the air 
is dirty and musty. Wooden shelves lining the crypt have long 
since rotten and collapsed, joining crumbled masonry on the floor 
Near the rear of the crypt, a heavy stone slab has been placed.

A Steep, Narrow Stone Staircase~
   This stone staircase delves deep under the settlement above, 
with dozens of smooth stone steps pushing deeper in to the bowels 
of the earth. The stairway itself turns and jerks every few 
steps though always decending. The walls are close at hand, made 
of jagged rock and packed earth, they offer barely enough room 
for a man to pass, in several places they have collapsed, 
partially burying the treacherous steps.

   At the bottom fo the staircase the cave opens out at each 
side. The air is thick and clotted with dirt and dust, it hangs 
heavy in the dark confines. Upon stepping from the final step, a 
long puddle of brackish water runs the entire length of the 
caves. It is added constantly to by the steady drip from various 
points in the stoney ceiling. To the west the tunnel narrows 
slowly, to the east it goes deeper.

   With just enough room for a average man to stand hunched the 
tunnel ahead quickly becomes narrow and small, becoming so tight 
that one must turn to slide through. The edges of the wall are 
little more than jagged edges of rock that snag and catch 
anything that passes by them. Underfood the shallow puddle grows 
deeper as as the stone pass dips further down.

A Suffocating, Narrow Tunnel~
   Deeper in to the line of tunnels, this section dips the 
furthest. The dank air barely breathable from the cloying stench 
of old plantlife. Underfoot the dirty water rises to ankle 
height, the smell from it adding to the suffocating condition, 
likewise the narrow passage itself prevents all but the smallest 
from standing at their full height. Either side of the dip in 
the tunnels, an earthen path rises.

   Dull, grey stone litters the walls and floor about this 
section of the tunnel, with large holes in both showing where 
most has came from. Several of the large boulders have formed a 
crude stepping bridge allowing one to rise slowly out of the 
tunnel or venture deeper. From the upward slope a faint breeze 
blows along with cleaner air. The tunnel itself is narrow 
despite its rise, granting passage only for one to pass through 
at once.

   Little more than a hollow, stone lined hole, this tunnel is 
edged entirely with rocks, some jagged and hard, others round and 
smooth. Many of them packed loosely in the damp earth. Crude 
hand and foot holes have been created at all places, causing a 
heap of debris to have formed at the base. The tunnel rises on 
an angle, forcing those wishing passage to move at nearly a 
crawl. At its top a stone boulder sits over its exit, a crude 
hand grip smashed from a corner of it.

Moving Along a Dark, Dank Tunnel~
   Growing narrower, the tunnel is utterly dark with no torch or 
lamp offering light. The surface of the ground is damp and 
uneven, the walls winding and made of little more than damp 
earth. Puddles of dirty water gather in shallow holes in the 
ground, added to by the steady drip of small stalactite from the 
rocky ceiling. Like the rest of the cavern, it is narrow and 
small, with just enough room to allow passage.

allowing a knee-deep pool of dirty water to collect. Above the 
pool the root collection of a great tree has came through from 
the wall, it nearly blocks the passage south as it grows in to 
the earthy ground below. The tunnel remains narrow as with the 
rest of the system, with angled rocks stabbing out at various 
points.

jagged path cutting a path through the soil and stone. It's 
course remains rougly true until it takes a sudden turn to the

just enough room for a body to slide through, revealing the rest 
of the tunnel behind it.

ceiling of compacted earth high above. Various musty pelts lay 
upon the floor, acting as crude carpeting. Past its prime the 
hall is functional though the passage of time shows with many 
cobwebs strung together at its higher reaches. Doors have been 
fitted to the West and east. While to the south the grand hall 
expands further. Upon the smooth stone walls hang torches, 
casting a flickering light upon the majority of the area.

A Cluttered Office~
   A comfortably-sized room, this space has obviously been made 
into an office. The furniture has a layer of dust coating it 
from years of disuse. Old worn maps hang on the walls, barely 
recognizable from the ravages of time. The paint on the walls 
has faded and the plaster is peeling from the ceiling.

A Well-Used Mess Hall~
   This room is a combination eating area and kitchen with the 
stoves and kitchen furniture towards the back of the long room 
and various tables scattered about the front half of the room. 
There are a series of large windows along the eastern wall, 
looking out into the untamed yards beyond. A thick layer of dust 
covers everything in the room and there are cobwebs hanging from 
the wooden chandeliers. There is a stench of long-rotted food 
from the far end of the room near the larder and pantries.

beneath each are large foot lockers marked with matching colors 
as their bunk's bed linens. The plaster walls have chipped paint

   This room has been built underground and is made of 
tightly-mortared stone bricks that have been sealed to prevent 
water seepage. The floor is bare bricks as well and there are 
vast shelves and racks filling the room. A staircase leads up to 
a trapdoor that leads into the office above. The walls, ceiling 
and floor have been painted a dingy white and there metal sconces 
nailed into the wall posts to give light through the aisles of 
shelves and racks.

Outside the Eastern Gates of Caolafon~
   The trail through the swamp leads up to a walled town to the 
west and back into the swamp to the east. The town's walls 
appear old and worn and in some places even broken and partially 
destroyed. The road is overgrown with weeds and appears to have 
been neglected for many many years. The ground approaching the 
town has been cleared of all obstacles and brush.

places, the mud underfoot sucks at your boots, trying to pull 
them off your feet. Looking far to the north, you can barely 
make out, faintly against the horizon, the dark cliffs of the 
Emyn Muil. They are so faint, even if you could find a way 
north, it would be a march of many days to reach them.

   Bracken and mire have given way to an oasis, of sorts. There 
is a hammock of a small variety of marshland trees growing here. 
The ground is dry under the trees, and they act as a fair 
windbreak. Only the occasional hoot of an unseen owl, from 
deeper within the hammock, breaks the eerie silence.

Back Hall of the Boar's Head Inn~
   This offset area to the main inn commons provides some 
seclusion for a more private conversation, however, patrons 
passing by between the bar and the path to the outhouse outside 
often interrupt the feeling of intimacy. A dark-stained wooden 
floor ends in a thick-hanging curtain of leather leading outside 
to a small patio beyond, the area closest to the doorway often 
caked with mud in various footprints that gradually fades on the 
way to the primary room. A posted dart board and some hunting 
trophies provide some decoration to the otherwise bare walls.

Top of an Outhouse Path~
   The caustic smell of lye mixes here with the unique air of 
outhouse aroma, though some care has been given to preserving the 
area to some degree. The passing of many feet has stomped what 
grass or foliage that once clung to this manmade hill into 
oblivion, leaving only a muddy hill that grows intensely slippery 
when wet. Large stones placed horizontally into the hill face 
provide a form of steps on the way to the line of small wooden 
outhouses - organized into two pairs- allowing a patron to 
#6choose#0 the #6left#0 pair set with painted purple doors, or

Boar's Head Brewing Alcove~
   Tucked back into this small corner of the kitchen is a brewing 
alcove, a slate shingle roof above venting out into iron piping, 
that keeps the heated steam of the brew-works away from the 
vulnerable timber roof above. The lime and whitewashed packed 
earth and river stone walls hold the powerful scent of roasted 
grain, and the bitter aromatics of brewing hops and fermentation. 
Distilling and brewing equipment lies scattered about the area, 
providing a workspace for those knowledgeable.

leads to the dockyards. Slippery and overgrown with thick, green 
moss the ramp proves somewhat difficult to cross without a fair 
degree of concentration. Looking in either direction, a wooden 
dock continues into the visible distance, rotting hemp ropes tied 
to squat posts at the water's edge the only remaining evidence of 
the many boats that once moored here.

Centerpoint of a Rotting Dock~
   The centerpoint of this willow dock juts out into a small 
depression, formed by the passing river channeling into lower set 
inlet. This spot connects the aged berth back towards the 
village walls and beyond the cobbled stone road of Heol Tafam. 
Discarded bits of the day's catch attract bird and scavanger 
species to frequent this spot, giving the area a fishy aroma. 
Fishermen and other dockworkers work by lantern and pipe-light 
during the evening hours, casting the area into shadow.

An Old Marble-Laid Hall~
   This pleasant hall opens up grandly from the broad gates to 
the east, three wide white marble steps leading from the area 
just in front of the gates to an expansive lobby of fine stone 
with doors leading in many directions. The walls are made of 
white stone: old and functional, the material is nonetheless 
clean and attractive. A large marble staircase lined with brass 
banisters is old and broad at its base, but nonetheless 
functional as its path steadily narrows up to a broad floor lined 
with a brass railing, branching off into a number of other rooms. 
Great marble arches on either side of the staircase lead west 
into a wide area, while smaller corridors lead both north and 
south. Conspicuously, railings on the ceiling seem designed to 
hold banners: but these railings are currently empty.

The Winged Stallion Imports and Exports~
   This office has seen better days. The paint is chipping from 
the walls and the carpets are worn and old. Some have spots on 
the edges where water has spoiled the fabric. An old, weathered 
desk sits predominately in the center of the room and there are 
bookcases in varied degrees of disrepair along the walls. 
Affixed to the northern wall is a map of the town with the empty 
lots noted in green ink.

Along a Frog-Filled Dock~
   The old, wooden beams of this willow wood dock sorely need 
maintanence, the beams offset and set apart in several locales, 
creating creating wide gaps in the walkway that pose threats to 
unwary walkers. Looking over the side of the dock, tiny bubbles 
and ripples indicate the small fish and other creatures that live 
in the nearby river. Old, salty fishermen hawk their wares, 
showing off their fresh catch to passersby, adding to the din of 
the frogs and birds plentiful here along the shore.

A Slighty Swaying Dock Section~
   A dock built from willow and driftwood shifts ever so slightly 
to the ebb and flow of the river underneath it. The pungent odor 
of decay and brackish water abounds. Birds squawk and squeal 
overhead, mingled with the sound of water, slapping against the 
submerged log poles, which support the wooden dock. Discarded 
bait and other fishing attributes lie about, attesting to the 
seafood bounty of the nearby waters.

Northern End of an Aged Dock~
   A near constant flock of hungry birds circle the air above the 
dock, swooping down to pick off wayward frogs and abandoned 
scraps from the day's catch. The willow dock creaks and groans 
under the weight of passersby, its unsteady construction 
beginning to bulge and sag in several spots. A long, string of 
repaired clay lanterns swing back and forth on a twisted 
mildew-blackened jute cord, providing mild assistance to twilight 
hours. A passing sailor or fisherman may provide #6help#0

A Litter Strewn Boardwalk~
  Flanked with the refuse from trade and travel from an Age long 
ago, this boardwalk venue sits decked with abandoned piles of 
rotting and forgotten goods. Empty jars, overturned crates, and 
broken bits of fishing net and lures just a few of the things 
tangling up the pathway up and down the dock, a viable risk to 
any brave enough to walk the deck unshod. The soft croak of 
frogs fills the air mixing into a terrible din with the calls and 
beckons of the fishmongers and the workers that litter the docks.

A Shrine-Set Dock~
   An old, rusty iron anchor melded to a round stone base sits 
along one side of this boardwalk, a memorial of the ancient 
mariners that once proudly claimed this dock as home. The dried, 
shriveled stems of flowers lie strewn about the statue, their 
desiccated husks the last remnants of a loved one's affections. 
The creaky, well-abused dock continues on towards the west, 
jutting outwards into the nearby river. To the south, a weedy 
and barely visible passage provides glimpses of a section of 
accessable shoreline.

and scuttle about in buckets, baskets, and crates, the 
inhabitants attempting to escape the inevitable. Slick with 
water and fish offal, staying behind the make-shift counter 
nailed to two open topped barrels provides the only reprieve from 
slipping and falling into the river below. Scratches on the 
counter display different kinds of quarry indicate prices for the 
illiterate, and a long post with a iron lamp keeps the stall lit.

hallway branches off into two simple, spartan dormitories, the 
scents and sounds of the commons and kitchen below often wafting 
up into the hallway, giving a indicator of the day's meals and 
activities long before one descends the stairs. A brightly 
painted purple door sits to the east with a garish red twin 
sitting opposite across the hall. Receiving warmth from the

Before an Odd, Arcane-Marked Tent~

tent of various shades sitting here in this field off the main

Decorated with arcane writings and other odd-markings, the tent 
fills the field with the smell of blood, herbs, and smoke - the 
makings of a rural herbalist or healer, rather than the more 
regimented care of one trained in the medicines of Gondor proper.

   This semi permanent tent has a wooden frame covered in thick 
leather patched in a myriad of shades. A fire burns continually 
in the centre of the tent, upon which a variety of herbs seem to 
be regularly thrown, sending a heady plume of smoke rising up 
through a circular hole at the apex of the roof, an ineffectual 
effort that still often leaves the entire tent hazy and 
smoke-filled. Arcane paintings in various colored inks, chalk, 
and the dried brown color of animal or worse human blood decorate 
the walls, while strange pieces of bone, amulets and aging 
feathers further decorate the leather canvas. A small table with 
some bottles and bandages, and a series of wooden bunks carry 
marks of both saw and blood - signs of the healers occupation.

scent of wood felled only a short time ago. Basic but 
functional, sturdy construction of overlapping wooden shingles 
protects the sides of the boat from the rocks and other hazards

railings provide seats for those lacking sea-legs to stand for

top - a green flag with a single emblem - the proud figure of a

gold-embroidered crown topping its kingly ursine head.

At last the green banner of the ship is unfurled at the top of the mast, and last calls are made to the shore for any passangers on this journey to step aboard.

Boggy Heath Heading Towards a Walled-Town~
   The last remnants of water from the nearby Anduin empties 
here, into a pool of brackish water in a small pond, the flow 
mostly halted by a twiggy dam that stretches along the marshy 
overflow. Many willows sit along the waterfront, their bark 
suffering heavily from gnaw marks. From along the low waterline, 
the land quickly rises into a knobby hill, its surface covered in 
soft grass, or oft many soft pastel wildflowers in spring. 
Towards the west, the visible smoke of chimneys and the faint 
outline of a stone-walled town prove visible to keen eyes.

no visible trees and little other large vegetation, this small 
area is apt to turn boggy when the river exceeds its banks. 
Small, water-rounded rocks deposited from an earlier flood lie 
scattered about the area, providing dangers to feet of Men and 
beast. Covered in green-brown lichen moss, the rock's earthy 
smell mixes with the breeze. Haphazard clumps of wild light 
purple heather add some color as the way meanders further west.

Further Towards a Rustic-Looking Town~
   Rising out of the nearby grasses like a dark island from 
golden-green seas is an enormous and rotting tree stump. Nearly 
the height of a normal man in radius, this vast giant lives its 
last during an Age long past, judging from the decay and growth 
covering the wood. Insects have eaten away vast divots and 
slopes from what assuredly was the work of Man and axe. The 
roots of this long gone giant spread out, lost in the ocean of 
weedy plantlife, providing a bumpy walk over this field.

Nearing the Gates of a Stone-Walled Town~
   Tufting green and light brown grasses make up what is left of 
this field. Large ruts from wagon wheels, and clobbering by 
beasts of burden from passengers in the past churned most of this 
field into barren dusty mush, from which it never recovered. The 
large, knotty stump of a large tree, long since felled sits 
amidst the field its flat surface carved with many sigils and the 
occasional dirty drawing. Wooden and cloth debris dropped by 
travelers, and various other broken bric-a-brac lies strewn 
amidst the grass. The rusted gates of a town rise towards the 
west, the sounds of smells of civilization entering on the air. 
It is noticeable that old curves in the land here and exposed 
roots hint that this approach to the town has been kept free of 
shelter and places to feel less exposed.

A Long, Narrow Back Room~
   Set between the shop and the edge of the town wall, this room 
is very narrow east and west, but spreads out to the north and 
south, and has a low, cramped, wooden roof. A table takes up 
much of the space in the middle of the room, with shelves for 
supplies at the far ends. People can pass each other, but only 
if they are not carrying large items. There are no windows, but 
there is light, provided by a lamp, hung directly above the 
table. Visitors can #6leave#0 the #6room#0 towards the west.

Along the Shore of the Great River~
   Waves lap against a sandy and rocky shore. Footing is 
treacherous, as there are deep holes cut by the river before it 
receded to its current shoreline. Gazing northwest, across the 
Anduin, you can make out one of the many mouths of the Entwash, 
perhaps a mile or two distant. To the north, the ground rises as 
a large stone cliff juts out from the swampy land beside the 
river.

A Ruined Bunk Room~
   A series of cot frames remain in this refuse strewn room. 
Some are broken, some appear to be structurally sound. There are 
no mattresses, though some shredded batting can be seen in the 
corners, covered in rodent droppings. The mice, or rats, are all 
that have lived here for many years. A broken door lies in its 
frame to the south, while a passageway leads west.

A Robust Stone Kitchen~
   The older stone construction of the south and east walls of 
this well-appointed kitchen contrast with a slightly lighter 
shade of granite used in the freshly repaired west and north 
walls. The floor is similarly a mix of new and old granite 
tiles, more even in color. In the southwest and northwest 
corners of the room, polished bronze hooks bear lanterns to 
comfortably light the area, and the north wall is punctuated by a 
double row of wooden pegs sticking out few inches from the wall 
for drying or tool storage. A squat stove dominates the south 
wall, and an arched doorway leads east back into the barracks.

A Spartan Blacksmith Dormitory~
   This rather bland and unadorned room has only the barest of 
neccessities - a line of simple wood beds covered in fur blankets 
of various kinds and shades. With no rug covering the floor, the 
unshaded sanded planks provide a rude awakening against bare feet 
in the colder months. The warmth of the air circulating in from 
the hot forge beyond that warms the room seems otherwise unable 
to penetrate that reverberating cold. A blue-painted willow door 
leads back to the hallway and the return to the kitchens.

A Public Open-Air Forge~
   The disaster that was so recently evident on this lot appears 
to be in the process of becoming memory only, Though not all 
scars have yet faded. The cobblestones are still cracked and 
broken, there is still a large hole in the ground and the near 
wall of the shop situated behind the forge is still scorched and 
scarred, but the rubble has long since been cleared away and new 
construction is sprouting in its place. What was once a jagged 
hole in the ground has neatly been evened into a useable form and 
put to use in the reconstruction, which now appears to be 
proceeding quickly. What appears to be a large tower of granite 
rises from the depths of the pit to a height of three men, a 
carefully constructed earthen ramp visible and growing steadily 
nearer to the tower of stone. An enormous bellows is nearby, and 
an anvil has been set in place. The area is otherwise filled 
with various items needed to continue construction.

   Here a marshy swampland mixes with the nearby low thinly 
tufted grass, creating a brackish swamp near the town walls 
towards the east. The water lazily moves towards the north, tiny 
silver fish and small black tadpoles swim about just under the 
water's surface, this swampy spot perfect for less agile life 
forms. The loud croaks of frogs and the lonely calls of cranes 
and kingfishers who come to dine on them, fill the air with a 
cacophony of sound during all hours of the night and day.

branches of the willow create a small lagoon, and the chirps and 
chortles of many small birds living amongst the ancient branches 
renting the air. A mossy, earthy scent pervades the area, and 
many areas with standing water buzzing with the hum of 
dragonflies. Visible off towards the west sit the stone walls of

Murky Swampland~
   Here the heath land along the river has pulled back, the 
flowing Anduin cutting deep into the soft, grassy land as it 
continues along its meandering path towards the northeast. The 
riverbed tips to low level, increasing the challenge of staying 
afloat to any attempting to swim along its currents. Thick 
rushes and several tall, water-fed trees dot the shoreline, 
providing homes for the multitude of small creatures of various 
kinds that live here along the flowing river.

Drying Swamps North of a Road~
   Water from the Anduin spills often onto the low lying grass 
here during its highest rises, creating a swampy and muddy mess. 
Tufts of odd white weeds grow in between the thin roots of the 
low lying grass, the thin foliage providing little barricade 
against the flowing water. In several spots, the grass is 
completely missing, soft brown mud overtaking large patches. 
Abundant animal prints from several creatures about hint it at 
the variety of life about the riverbed.

The chirps of many thrush birds fill the area with chatter, their

Refuse Set Field Along the Town Walls~
   The riverrock and mortar wall of the village of Caolafon stops 
all attempts at travel towards the west, the scents and sounds of 
Men drifting over the walls and into this lie-lowing field. An 
old pile of refuse of discarded clay bits, wooden castoffs, and 
scrap metal collect in a heap that now grows with moss and grass, 
nature slowly overcoming the blight of the junk heap. Field mice 
and the occassional raccoon scamper about the hill, attempting to 
discover any lasting treasures from the pile.

Overgrown Fields Along the Walls of a Town~
   Dull brown and yellow straw-like grasses cover this entire 
field, the stark bareness of the area apparent from the complete 
lack of color or vibrancy. A tract of taller, thin-stalked 
grasses create wave their broad spikelets in the breeze, a dry, 
rustling sound mixing with the occasional chirps and whistles 
from the small flock of birds living amongst the dry rushes. 
Several large rocks stick haphazardly from the ground, making 
movement very difficult with a horse or wagon.

Weedy Fields Near the Southern Corner of a Walled Town~
   The twisted, thorny bushes here are larger than usual, as high 
as a Mans head, and a score of them have grown in a large circle, 
their sharp thorny branches intertwined, presenting a formidable 
barricade to any who wish to pass towards the south. There is no 
other growth around the perimeter for some strides in any 
direction, not even the hardy clumps of razor-sharp grass that 
dot the rest of this barren waste, caused by some apparent action 
of Man in the distant past, the land here still recovering.

   Stretching in from the west and off towards the south, this 
hard brown ground lays flat and featureless, unable to sustain 
more than scattered growths of hardy broad-leaved brown grass or 
an occasional stunted, twisted bush. The dirt is crusted and 
smooth on top, but boots break through sharply and suddenly at 
each step, sinking and sliding slightly, making it impossible to 
feel as if one has ones balance. A slight haze seems to blur the

grassland stretches into the north towards a pathway, and 
afterwards, a rich, earthy peat bog.

Within a Field Nearing a Road~
   Even when the wind is still, this swath of meadowland seems 
constantly in motion. Patches of different grasses make this 
area of riverside veldt a canvas of colors, ranging from silvery 
blue-grey to a deep verdant green. Tall weeds and woody twigs 
mingle with the grass, creating homes for many small creatures 
that burrow and skitter out of sight, leaving only rustling in 
their wake. The Anduin sits visible some distance to the 
northeast, the walls of a nearby town off towards the west.

An Overgrown Swamp Nearing a Trail~
   Several large fallen trees block the flow of spilloff water 
from the Anduin to the north, only the minimalist of currents 
rippling over the surface. Fallen leaves and other debris 
clutter this small marsh, the rotting vegetation and ever-present 
thick green moss clinging to most surfaces creates a prominent, 
earthy smell. The buzzing of many green-blue dragonflies and 
small black flies fill the air with a constant drone. The watery 
marsh gives way to a softer green heath towards the east.

Within a Large Open Field~
   Looking to the east, one can see the tops of several smaller 
hillocks from the high point of this relatively tall summit. A 
barren plain stretches endlessly in the southern horizon, the 
grass brown, thin, and sparse. Several knee-high rocks punctuate 
the barren landscape, weathered and clad in dried lichens, they 
attest in an earlier time with more abundant water. Towards the 
northwest, the Anduin flows along into a nearby swampy marsh.

Southern End of a Large Field~
   This patch of land barely clings to the moisture seeping in 
from the swamp towards the north. Small clumps of purple-topped 
heather and low green grass gradually turning into dull yellows 
and browns showing the stark contrast between the riverlands and 
the dry, flat plain beyond. Barely visible, small brown bodies 
often dash and dart between the grasses; animals working hard for 
survival on the edge of such barrens.

Among Some Small Mounds~
   This part of the field is dotted with small overgrown mounds. 
The grass rises high, almost to the knee of an average-sized man. 
Small animals and insects move through the grass, up and down the 
mounds. The field spreads out on three sides, though it appears 
to die off towards a forest-line to the far south.

Within a Sprawling Field~
   The hillocks descent slowly into a flatland and the smell of 
the nearby swamp begins to permeate the air. The grasses liven 
up and are greener and more thick here, getting much needed water 
from the swamp's runoff from the north. Further to the east, the 
grass drops into a lowland. Further to the south some mounds can 
be made out within the grass.

Remnants of a Swampy Marsh~
   The frequent honking and calling of birds fill this area with 
their renting sound, the thick rushes and cattails in the marsh 
home to many a small creature. Here the tufting green grass and 
small shrubby bushes sit along water line, the splashes and jumps 
of small silvery fish and tiny frogs visible on close inspection. 
Several large rocks clog up the water's flow, their weathered 
grey surface clouding over with moss and bird droppings.

A Beaver-Laden Patch of Swampland~
   Water from the nearby Anduin has spilled onto this grassy 
lowland, creating a swampy bog. Short green grass intertwines 
with nubby brown bushes and several hollow trees, the insides 
long since rotten away from insects and the nearby conditions. 
Lichens and moss cover nearly every surface plant, an acrid and 
earthy smell pervading area. Beavers often swim in from their 
elaborate dam build to the north, gathering up fallen twigs to 
continue their never-ending efforts at building and patching.

Along the Edge of a Large Field~
   The water subsides more as the swampland begins to ease off 
into a field of grass. The edge of the bog eases in and out of 
the grassland as the water rises and lowers in the Anduin beyond. 
The grassland is scattered with small water-damaged logs and 
other bits of debris from the bog.

   Tall grass spreads out far and wide, coming to a stop only at 
the edge of the bogs and forest to the east and south. Insects

home. Every so often, the ears of a rabbit can be seen hopping 
up and down from within the swaying leaves of the grass.

newly-thatched and dry. Walls of water-stained plaster with some

A Wild, Overgrown Garden~
   The wall of the tall, imposing building to the west is almost 
lost in the tangle of vines that grows here, thick, woody stems 
as big around as a man's arm twining into a leafy facade. 
Bushes, hedges, and vines enclose whatever forms of fencing might 
once have been visible here, creating a riotous living hedge that 
long ago moved beyond the ability to be tamed. The ground has 
been cleared here, though, with neat rows of garden-patch holding 
their own. A massive pear tree shoots above the twining vines in 
one corner, its thick trunk now mossy and old. Off to the other 
side is an area of flagstone surrounding a large kiln, the 
charred remnants of vines creating a natural buffer around it.

a haphazard array of cramped shelves and drawers, holding all

peeling off, mostly unreadable in the Northern-script.

   Not particularly large, but comfortable enough for a small

The floor boards are weathered, worn by the passage of feet 
coming and going. Round, grey river stones make up the bottom 
half of the walls, noticeably lighter new mortar showing where 
older, ruined mortar was replaced to secure the walls. Rough 
cut, but sturdy, timbers form the upper walls and arch to support 
the slate tile roof. The arches are unfinished but newly placed, 
while the tile roof is in very good repair, the sturdy stone 
withstanding the weathering of time. A small, stone fireplace is 
built into the eastern wall, providing warmth to the combination 
cooking and living area, while shuttered windows are set into the 
walls to allow daylight in.

iron-banded doors. Each door has a small iron-bared window at 
the top and a solid wooden hatch at the bottom that can only be 
opened from the outside. A desk stands in the middle of the 
room, in which it normally sits a guard. Next to the northern 
door are a couple of chests on the floor and a few pegs on the 
walls.

   This stone cell is small and cramped to say the least. A 
simple wooden cot has been fixed to the western wall, padded only 
with some hay and a coarse burlap blanket. A little clay bowl 
and a bucket stands in one corner, other then that the damp cell 
is bare. A thick door with an iron-barred little window leads 
out, a thick hatch which can only be opened from the outside sits 
on the lower part of the door.

An Old and Worn Store Room~
   Old and somewhat rundown, this storage room is built of the 
same stone and timber construction as the rest of the building. 
However, this room seems to have been less strenuously repaired 
with water damage showing in several places, the mortar 
discolored and occasionally slightly cracked. The air is a 
little bit damp, and smells faintly musty. Lining the walls of 
the room are old wooden shelves, rough and unfinished, some of 
the planks missing or in the beginning stages of moisture-rot. 
One can easily #6leave#0 the #6storeroom#0 through the doorway.

Dusty, Well-Abused Workshop~
   A large worktable takes up the majority of this backroom, its 
expansive surface dominating the western wall, and making moving 
about the tight space a bit awkward. Obviously well-used before 
its eventual abandonment, sawdust and spare scraps of wood cover 
the entire floor, scrunching underfoot and filling the air with 
the particle-ridden dust. Dirty shelves of partially-rotting 
wood dominate the walls, in obvious need of some intense repair.

   This old, dusty room despite its dirty and unkempt appearance, 
manages to maintain a light and airy atmosphere. Skillfully 
carved rafters hold the high peat roof ceiling aloft, providing 
for an open feel, the reinforced building seeking to keep out 
both weather and creature. Daylight filters into the roof from a 
carved slot in the eave, illumination at twilight provided by a 
set of well-used sconces along the wall.

the pervasive metallic smell of blood seems ingrained in the very

comfortable bedroom, with enough space that two of three could 
share it adequately. Close to the patched peat roof of the shop, 
the room tends to be chilly during colder months and slightly 
damp during rainy ones, though a warm fire burning in the kitchen 
nearby keeps it from being unbearable. A raggedy bear rug, once

Stairway Near Boar's Head Dorms~
   This recently constructed stairway still contains the scent of 
freshly sanded wood, setting it oddly apart from the rest of this 
well-abused building. Leading to an extension of the Inn's 
interior, a short hallway only a few feet from the stairs ends in 
twin set of rooms that sit opposite one another. Of a simple, 
yet effective kind of design, the space has a warm, home-like 
feeling. A few sconces, curiously carved out of twisting antlers 
decorate the walls to provide illumination.

against the chill and damp with a small river-rock fireplace set 
within. Flat, dark grey slate tiles line the chimney exit 
providing protection for the rest of the straw and peat roof from 
any willful embers that might otherwise threaten to singe.

peat roof of the rest of the shelter buffeted against the heated 
steam and smoke rising from the fireplace chimney. Well 
weathered and sturdy stones create the walls and floor, providing 
a very functional, but little decorated work space for cooking. 
Warmth from this area fills the rest of the house, the smells 
from work done mixing with the odd scent of old, musty fabrics 
and mildew that clings to the very air here.

Clothing Store Bunkroom~
   A simple leather-curtained archway leads into this small, but 
comfortable bunkroom, with enough space that two of three could 
share it adequately. Close to the patched peat roof of the shop, 
the room tends to be chilly during colder months and slightly 
damp during rainy ones, though a warm fire burning in the kitchen 
nearby keeps it from being unbearable. A set of old, well-abused 
bunks sit here, their frames in need of rather serious repair.

A Small, Private Bedroom~
   Entering this small, private bedroom you step through a 
blue-painted door and see that the stone in the walls have been 
cowered with a white-painted panel of wood. The ceiling is of 
solid woodwork with the beams visible. Warmth coming from the 
kitchen through the southern wall provides some relief from the 
cold and damp. On the western wall a small window offers a 
glimpse of the nearby buildings and roof tops when not covered by 
its hatch. The air holds a mixture of smells from smoke, 
cooking, fresh paint and wood along with fabric and occasionally 
the stale scent of the bog when the wind blows from the east.

of this small stall. A tattered canvas covering would shield 
those inside from the weather if it were not for the ragged holes 
torn in the middle. low countertop covered in dust and 
splintered woods offers a place to sell goods, and a few shelves 
behind provide minimal storage. Several of the shelves rest

appears to have been recently weeded. A brand new cabin sits in 
the middle of the lot, slightly on the southern side with an 
entrance on the north. Foundations have begun to be set up 
around, marking out points where further buildings are intended 
to be raised. You can head to the back yard by walking east.

A Muddy Courtyard~
   Set snugly between the Hall and hunting shop, this courtyard 
is little more than a square of hard-packed dirt, scuffed barren 
of any trace of grass. Straw has been strewn thickly over the 
yard in a futile attempt to ward off the churning mud, while a 
number of hides and stones mark off various patches of the 
ground. The center of the courtyard bears the yards single 
permanent fixture, an old stone well.

beams have been elaborately carved with ivy and knotwork, while 
elsewhere the likeness of strange and legendary beasts look down 
over the inhabitants, roaring from their wooden prison. The 
hard-packed dirt floor is covered in sawdust, straw and thick 
furs, while benches and low tables provide a comfortable place to 
relax or sleep. The center of the hall is dominated by a 
lengthy, open-air hearth, at the western edge of which resides an

wooden beams running parallel along the entire length of the 
wall, at about the level of a man's waist and a foot above his 
head, secured to granite brackets. Dozens of hooks, slots, and 
holes have been placed along the beams's lengths to allow the 
placement of a great number and variety of weapons; however less 
than a quarter of the available spaces along the racks are 
occupied, by mostly iron weapons. The room's center is occupied 
by two rows of wooden armor racks although, again, they are 
mostly empty, except for a few random pieces of iron armor. A 
long, wooden, waist-high cabinet counter, bears carvings of 
rings, cut gemstones, and charms on necklaces, hinting at its 
contents. It runs parallel to the southern wall where a sturdy 
wooden door allows access to the back of the shop. If one 
lingers long enough, he or she inevitably notices that something 
smells fishy, literally, its source indiscernable.

A Tidy, Organized Back Room~
   Clean and neat, this store backroom possesses the feel of a 
well-traveled intersection. Each corner of the room has been 
developed to serve a different purpose; armor, weapon and tool 
racks, a granite-surfaced workbench, storage shelving and a 
hulking materials bin on the west wall. The door and doorway 
northward are of finer make, recently refinished with care. A 
ladder stands ready on the north side of the room to allow access 
to the loft above, matched to the east by a thick oak door in a 
reinforced frame. A solidly-constructed oak door leads west. A 
large desk rests atop a three-foot-high platform which extends 
from the central area of the southern wall. Five steps of brick 
rise to meet the platform's western edge, allowing effortless 
access to the imposingly-positioned desk. Employees can

A Windowless, Pitch-Dark Bedroom~
   This room is notable for its utter lack of windows or any 
light source, whether it be oil lamps on hooks or torches in 
scones. However, despite its perpetual darkness, one can tell, 
even in the sparse lighting of a held torch, that it has been 
recently occupied and kept tidy, completely absent of dust and 
cobwebs, the furniture, walls and floor in good repair. The 
walls and floor are composed of granite, every block of the 
latter inscribed in the center with a different rune, possibly 
dwarven.

A Cluttered Storage Area~
   A bit stuffy and bone-dry, this small room is lined with three 
layers of reinforced shelving starting just over three feet from 
the floor. Various containers of all description, open, closed 
and covered, are nestled together in a bewildering array of 
storage. Some of these have been labeled in charcoal or with 
small parchment tags glued down. A functional three foot high 
step ladder lurks nearby, having been hammered together from 
thick pine planking. A heavy, oak-framed door leads westward 
into the back room.

A Fragrant Loft~
   Perched above the bulk of the shop, this cozy loft space is 
described by the angled roof shape intended to shed the weight of 
snow in the winter. The floor is hardwood timber, recently 
sanded and stained to bring the surface up to a deep, rich brown 
hue. The oily scent of cedar and the sweet musky fragrance of 
pitch -- originating from a tar-laminated, water-resistant 
membrane of burlap nailed to a gabled framework above -- while 
pleasant enough, give the somewhat unnerving sensation that one 
is an insect nestled under soon-to-be-ignited kindling. Small 
pegs protrude from the end walls for hanging objects, and a 
lantern hook features prominently in the center beam. In one 
corner a hinged brass valve sits against the walls, ventilated 
with holes to allow coals to be placed inside to safely heat the 
room. In the opposite corner, a slight ridge has been nailed 
down into place around the edge of a hole, with one end of a 
ladder peeking up to allow passage down. A window in the center 
of the northern wall allows a pleasant view of the street below.

   This plain, unadorned workshop that looks like it's not been 
used in quite some time, every nook and cranny set with the dust 
of age. Stains of clay, slip, and paint, litter the floorboards 
that creak from disuse and shift. Lanterns, though heavily 
patinaed, still allow the room to be well-lit to facilitate

An Overrun Kiln-Set Yard~
The old fence has been torn down, replaced with a sturdy new
fence. The yard itself is fairly quiet, set a short distance
from the local tavern, but occassionally drunken shouting
can still be heard here. In the center of the yard, set in
the midst of a patch of dirt is a large kiln, old though it
still appears to be functional. Within the western wall is
set a pair of double yew wood doors.

previously used to store pottery goods - broken shards, and ashen 
colored pottery dust covers the area. Straw and peat has fallen

   A simple leather-curtained archway leads into this small, but 
comfortable bedroom, with enough space that two of three could 
share it adequately. Close to the open door leading to the yard, 
the room tends to be chilly during colder months and slightly 
damp during rainy ones. Tiling, once highly beautiful and bright 
decorates the walls in a woodland scene - the bright greens and 
blues now most faded into mute pastels.

   A cobblestone path framed by flowerbeds leads towards a quaint 
cottage. The humble home features a thatched roof of sable hues 
and a fresh coating of white paint on the stone walls. A few 
small square windows with red frames have been set beside the 
sturdy front door. Rose bushes line the cottage wall and a clay 
bird bath sits beneath the shade of a leafy tree.

the weathered floorboards and a pair of windows, draped with rose 
red curtains has been set into the southern wall, sitting either 
side of the front door. The western wall features a cozy 
fireplace and a set of stairs that climbs upwards. An open 
archway leads into a small office to the east while the aromatic 
scent of baked bread and herbs wafts in from the north where the 
room opens into a homely kitchen.

   With a pleasant and inviting appeal, this kitchen is both 
functional and homely. A polished dining table sits between the 
living room to the south and the northern wall where a heavy door 
and river-rock walls assist in keeping the heat generated from a 
cozy hearth inside. Two small square windows with cheerful 
cornflower blue curtains provide a view into the well-maintained 
garden outside. An assortment of pots and pans hang from hooks 
above the stove while the hearty aroma of freshly baked bread and 
sweet spices lingers in every corner of the room.

   Sturdy wooden stairs lead up from the room below, set with an 
old wooden railing long smooth from wear along the wall to 
provide stability when needed. The floor is made of the same 
thick, broad planks. This landing forms in the southwest corner 
of an attic with the thatched roof above reinforced by 
whitewashed boards on an angle that leans inwards to an apex. 
Thought slightly off-center, the room still provides good height 
and gives a warm, sturdy and well-tended impression. The hearth 
fire rises up through the stairwell, circulates into the attached 
bedrooms whenever the doors are open. The western and southern 
walls sports small shuttered windows that can be opened up to 
provide light and a glimpse of the outside or let out air on the 
rare chance the warmth becomes too oppressing.

yard below. The southern wall is made from timber painted in a 
romantic, yet faded rose red color that reflects a warm lighting 
whenever the ornate brass lantern mounted on the wall is lit. A 
dusty chandelier dangles from the tall attic roof with rounded 
glass beads that reflect the light of the tall, slender candles 
housed within. In addition to the bedroom furnishings, many 
ornate pots have been put on display, filled with decorative 
vines and scented herbs.

flat stones with soft grass growing up between the cracks. An 
old, looming pear-tree shades the area with its heavy, hanging 
branches. The trunk of the tree is covered by a thick vine that 
reaches all the way up and out on the larger branches. Under the 
tree and on the stone-clad ground sits a table. A cobblestone 
path leads past flower beds and garden plots towards a river-rock 
well, and a small firepit for evening time gatherings.

   This humble, well-worn room has an air of being a cosy, homely 
living area. The low, thatched roofing captures any heat that 
emanates from the river-rock fireplace, keeping any cold that 
creeps through the smooth floorboards at bay. An assortment of 
fresh, pelts create an inviting carpet that covers the room and 
emit an ourdoor scent that fails to escape through a small high 
window with narrow shutters on the northern wall. Candles line 
the sturdy shelving attached to the eastern beside the hearth.

A Large, Empty Lot Off Heol Plas~
   This lot looks to be fairly clean; only a few small rocks and 
various plants sprouting up in it. In some areas the ground 
looks to have been burned, no plant life growing in the dirt. 
The largest dead spot lies in the center of the lot. The lot 
ends to the north at the wall of a house, as does it to the east 
and west. In the northeastern corner of the lot sits an 
abandoned well; its base cleared of weeds and revealing the few 
cracks that run along the stone foundation. The lot seems to 
have had some recent activity, various markings made along the 
ground and boot prints of various sizes having been scattered 
about. To the south lies Heol Plas, running east and west.

A Cosy, Wide Room~
   This wide, open area is clearly the main gathering point of 
the building, it provides more than suffient room to its 
occupants even with the wooden staircase leading to the room 
above. The room itself is made entirely of timber, thick, solid 
slabs of wood make up the floors and walls, both worn smooth with 
the passage of time. Lanterns and torches provide an ever 
present light over the cosy room, added to this a once-fur rug 
had stretched across the entie floorspace, however constant 
footsteps have worn it smooth in places.

An Open Sleeping Loft~
   Stepping up from the stairway below, the most feature of this 
open loft is the low ceiling, with just enough room for the 
tallest of men to stand without trouble. It is made entirely of 
thick thatching, more than enough to ward off the foulest of 
weather. A few small windows have been set high upon the wall, 
giving only a little light. The rest coming from simple lamps 
that hang from the joists of the roof. Underfoot, furs and rugs 
have been laid in a haphazard manner, giving the entire area 
ample warmth.

A Dimly Lit Hallway~
   Starting at an archway of stone around the doorframe to the 
north, this hallway is framed by walls of smoothly fitted rocks. 
While just wide enough for a normal man to reach both walls if 
extending his hands to the sides fully the ceiling is somewhat 
higher then normal. The floor is made of thick, sturdy planks 
that match those in the ceiling above. Candleholders are placed 
at even distances, giving it a dim light throughout the nights or 
days when the shutters of the window at its southern end are 
closed. When open, the windows offer a view of the field outside 
and the fence that marks the borders of the backyards of the 
buildings beyond. In the middle of the western wall is a door 
and through the doorway to the east spreads warmth and the aroma 
of a kitchen.

A Spacious Kitchen~
   Even though the walls here display naked rocks that have been 
smoothly fitted together, this room has a warm and embracing 
feeling. The scent of spices, bread and other savory food 
lingers in the air, seeming to seep from the walls and furniture. 
For the most part the floor is made up of broad planks but in the 
eastern end, around the fireplace and the stove, large flat 
stones have been levelled instead, likely to minimize the hazards 
of fire. In the ceiling two squared logs rests upon the solid 
masonry walls and support the boards above. Through the window 
above the kitchen counter to the east you may rest your eyes upon 
the garden outside and in the western wall a doorway leads out 
into a hallway.

A Rectangular Room~
   This room is slightly longer from the north to south than east 
to west. The walls are made out of smoothly fitted rocks, 
covered by no plaster or tapestry, revealing the naked stones 
themselves. Broad and thick planks give the floor a more 
sheltered feeling. The same boards are seen in the horizontal 
ceiling above. When not blocked by the shutters, a window in the 
western wall offer an unhindered view of the yard outside, the 
approach from the gate and even the road travelling between the 
fence and the city wall. Candleholders are placed around the 
room to give some light in the dark hours. In the middle of the 
eastern wall sits a door.

An Empty Yard~
   This yard is the eastern end of a plot of land juts up against 
the fenced off fields to the north and to the stone walls of a 
shop to the south. The grass appears to have been recently 
weeded. A brand new cabin sits in the middle of the lot, 
slightly on the southern side with visible entrance on its 
western wall. Foundations have begun to be set up around, 
marking out points where further buildings are intended to be 
raised. The back of a large, run down building can be seen to 
the east. You can head around the cabin to the front yard by 
walking north.

Along the Shore of the River, Beside the Docks~
   This expanse of shoreline, just south of the docks, is covered 
in weeds and shrubs, littered with old fishing nets and broken 
crates fallen from the platforms above and half-buried in sand. 
A rough trail seems to have been cleared by a recent storm and 
from the wanderings of local fishermen, coming to an abrupt halt 
where the water laps gently against the sand.

In The Water Beside The Docks~
   After the initial descent from the ground above, the water 
here begins to deepen rapidly, swiftly declining to several feet 
in depth. The docks can be seen hovering above the surface of 
the water to the north, casting a looming shadow into the depths 
below. No matter the season the water here is rather chilly, the 
visible patches of sky still visible above seeming to press down 
menacingly.

In the Middle of the Great River~
   The river widens here, the current growing stronger, and there 
is small comfort to be had in the rare patches of light that 
manage to filter in from above. Deeper beneath the surface the 
water becomes dark and murky, making it nearly impossible to see 
what lies further down. Though there are occasional passing 
currents of warmer water, the temperature is bone-chilling, 
growing moreso with further progress below.

   The water down here is murky and frigid, the light from above 
thoroughly diluted, casting eerie green shadows on each surface 
it still manages to touch. The occasional piece of debris is 
pushed downstream by the current, a tree branch or a clump of 
weeds, floating past purposefully. The area descends into a 
still further, colder darkness, the water becoming nearly 
unbearably frigid. The continual press of the sky above and the 
drawing force of the bottom of the river somewhere unseen below 
creates an uncanny, otherwordly ambience.

A Shipwreck on the Bottom of the River~
   The bottom of the river emerges from the murky depths rather 
abruptly, the sandy foundation seeming to glitter a dark greenish 
hue with the last feeble, reaching strains of light. Amidst the 
shadowy deeps the looming figure of a shipwreck becomes visible, 
a rather large and gaping hole punched through the hull, clearly 
a contributing factor to the sinking. Seaweed climbs the base of 
the rotting planks, lichen beginning to overtake the parts of the 
ship that jut out from their half-buried position in the sand. 
The water here is unnaturally cold, creeping fingers of ice that 
seem to increase closer to the wreckage itself. The pressing 
silence of the water is suffocating, though a small pocket of 
stale air close against one of the rotting beams provides scant 
respite.

A Small Gathering Room~
   The square-shaped perimeter of this room is likely not more 
than twenty feet on a side, and the ceiling about half that 
length above the recently repaired hardwood floor. Despite its 
cramped nature, the room appears well-constructed and tended; the 
walls recently whitewashed to contrast with the dark flooring and 
beam work above. Thick wooden supports brace the peat and straw 
roof as it slopes towards a stairwell and upper hallway. A 
single window is housed within the southern wall, affording a 
view of the street outside and the graveyard beyond it. Solid 
oak doors are set into the eastern, western, and northern walls, 
the first allowing #6return#0 to the #6shopfront#0 beyond, and 
the latter used to #6access#0 the lore-house's #6storeroom.#0

it are exposed beyond the shelves' domain, shows no sign of

A Wide Granary~
   A wide but simply-constructed room, each corner has been held 
erect and safe from potential moisture below by a series of four 
solid staddle stones. Lacking in windows and often filled with 
shadows, this large granary would be merely a great open space 
were it not for the small division separating one half of the 
room from the other. The air is dry and heavy with the scent of 
foodstuffs, and the only breeze afforded is one made by the 
passage of people through the single small door.

vstr Caolafon's Ration Granary
vstr The Granary serves first and foremost to provide rations for the over two hundred and fifty men pledged to the Marsh Warden forces. In addition, it keeps rations for Guildsmen and other citizens as season and need requires. Recently built of sound structure, its stone posts keep the building aloft from the muddy soil on which the village rests and free from risk of vermin. Surely, the Granary should never run dry, or the village faces dire consequence of underfed troops to provide for its defense.

A Small, Overgrown Lot~
   This lot just off the main road is small and overgrown with 
hardy weeds. A narrow path has been worn through the high 
growth, leading to a rather precarious set of wooden steps that 
end at the entrance of what looks to be a granary. The structure 
is unusual, large and carefully built, without any visible 
external gaps in the wood. Supported by a series of four staddle 
stones, it easily dominates the small area.

Within a Sturdy, Horse-Drawn Cart~
   The interior of this cart is bland and utilitarian, and the 
shape of it is that of a rough box, suggesting use for the 
transport of goods, rather then people. Constructed of sturdy 
oak planking bound by iron for strength and durability, it has 
been left open at the top. It is devoid of any seating, save the 
small bench towards the front, for a driver and perhaps a 
companion.

   This room, seperated from the main armory, is accessed only by 
a narrow door set in the southern wall. It is rather small, with 
only enough space for a limited amount of storage, and though it 
is fairly clean there is an almost constant smell of mustiness 
and swamp even in the colder weather. The walls are bricks that 
have been plastered over, though a few cracks appear here and

  This slightly raised platform has been cleared of workers and

their skills.  Thick rope marks the boundaries on all sides of
the ring, but a short gap to the south where the ropes have been
tied into posts a few feet from one another, allows for entry and

A Fenced-in Field~
   This field takes up the rest of the lot south of the cabin and 
is completely fenced in. Grass fills the yard, with not much 
else in the way of plant life to be seen. The wooden fence runs 
around to the front yard where a gate can let you #6leave#0 the 
#6ranch#0 and head back out to the street. Sounds from people 
shopping can be heard to the west, as an alley runs behind the 
western side of the fence. The noise from the main street to the 
east also filters into the yard and the sounds of the lumber mill 
can be heard on especially clear days.

be propelled by both its main sail as well as teams of oarmen. 
The upper deck is well maintained, tidy bundles of rope and other 
tack set in orderly display. It is manned by a diligent and 
professional looking crew.

Caolafon~
atecho 45507  The sailors quickly cast off from the docks of Amdir. Ropes extending to the western bank of the great river rise up out of the water as teams of oxen take up the slack. Wads of algae and lichen drip water down to the waters of the Anduin as a creaking lurch announces the boat's departure from the docks and the relative safety of Amdir and the massive fort overshadowing the river.

atecho 45507 Fairly calm compared to what the river could be, the waters of Anduin flow past in smooth ridges from the front of the boat. The steady rise and fall of the oars grant the boat easy, albeit tiresome passage through the waters. On each side, fields and grassland can be seen marred only by the ruined stretch of Osgiliath sitting over the furthest reaches of the river.

   This roof is fairly sturdy, made from stonework instead of the 
peat that covers many of the neighboring roof tops. It is high 
enough to see down the road, allowing a clear view of the western 
gates of the city and the faint outlook of the Boar's Head Inn 
far to the east. The roof slopes down somewhat to a window ledge 
at the southern corner, allowing for someone to climb up here or 
back down to the street if they are skilled enough.
