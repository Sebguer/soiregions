a rust-encrusted pair of iron clippers~
A rust-encrusted pair of iron clippers is here.~
   These iron clippers have long-since rusted shut, the corroded 
blades stuck permanantly in place. Little more than the general 
shape of the object is discernable, though the metal handles do 
bear faint impressions, perhaps of some sort of design or craft 
mark, still visible despite the passage of time.

a stone pedestal holding the bottom half of a statue~
A low stone pedestal holding the bottom half of a statue is here.~
   The low pedestal is rectangular in shape and is adorned with 
simple designs around its base, the straight, even lines 
indicating fine craftsmanship. It holds up what appears to be 
the bottom half of a statue. Though it is difficult to tell who 
or what the figure originally was, from the precisely carved 
clothing and gear and the proportions of the legs, one might 
guess it to have once depicted a dwarf. However, the top seems 
to be missing entirely, having been broken across the midsection. 
Time has worn away much of the detail, but it is clear from what 
remains that this was created by a master of stoneworking.

The shattered remnants of a low stone bench lie here.~
   Large fragments of stone lie here, surrounding what appears to 
once have been a low rectangular bench, its sides covered in 
fanciful designs. Though worn and broken, the fine craftsmanship 
is still apparent. Some of the larger pieces bear what might be 
a kind of repeating pattern or lettering carved along the edges, 
but the cracked and shattered bits make it difficult to tell for 
sure.

The top half of a dwarf statue is lying here.~
   This is the top half of a statue of a dwarf, broken cleanly 
across the midsection, the bottom half missing entirely. Despite 
the numerous chips and cracks, from the figure's lifelike, if 
somewhat grim, expression and the fine details of his clothes and 
gear, it is obvious that this was crafted by someone of great 
skill.

A heavily tarnished metal flower has been left here.~
   This small, delicate piece of metal is a complex spiral of 
finely detailed, though heavily tarnished, bronze petals 
surrounding a half-sphere of iron. Though the center is little 
more than a blob of rust, and some of the outer petals have 
fallen off, the intricate shapes suggest masterful craftsmanship. 
It appears that this may once have been attached to something via 
the stem, for the broken end is twisted and rough.

the mark of a Cage is thickly painted on its surface with

The twisted scraps of an archaic maille hauberk lie here, covered in dust.~
   The crafter of this piece appears to have been a master. The 
tiny steel rings that comprise the piece are linked three deep. 
Despite the evidence to its great age it still flexes like fabric 
under the hand, conforming to whatever it rests on. The ornate 
quality of the hauberk is cunningly woven into the rings, subtle 
designs evident across the chest and shoulders. A tail of mail 
hangs from the neck of the piece, down the back, and looks to 
have once covered long missing leather strapping that secured the 
hauberk on the wearer. Starting at the right shoulder and then 
sharply angling inward is a rent of staggering brutality. the 
links appear to have torn as much as they were cut or broken. 
The cut angles inward toward the wearer's core and stops just shy 
of the center.

A steel-plated full-helm lies here, cloven and scorched.~
   Crafted out of what once was an extremely high quality steel, 
this archaic full-helm has been left a mirrored silver hue. It 
is smooth to the touch, even along the angular runes etched over 
its surface. It covers the entire face of the wearer, with only 
a long horizontal slit for vision and a crescent-shaped slit near 
the mouth for air. A long aventail of fine steel maille hangs 
from the bottom rim of this helm, curtaining the wearer's neck. 
Obviously aged from the crusty leather lining, this helm was 
clearly a magnificent and formidable protection for the wearer 
before it was horrendously ruined. Down the top and center of 
the helm is a wide gash, the steel bent down and jagged, however 
the most peculiar part is the scorch markings on each side of the 
grievous cleft.

   Looking to have been custom crafted and likely part of a 
complete set these maille sleeves hang in tatters. They are 
comprised of tiny steel links woven together and adorned with 
cunning accents integrated into the weave. They look to have 
been designed for quite thick arms. Despite their excellent 
craftsmanship and remarkable ingredients they have been severely 
disused. there are broken links giving way to melted sections of 
metal that would have exposed the soft flesh of the wearer 
underneath. Below the elbows they disintegrate and become 
several tattered strands that would not hang to the wearer's 
wrists. Tenuous scraps of leather still connect the arms and 
preserve them as a pair. They look to have withstood long and 
quite focused battery.

   These leggings, more chaps than a suit of pants, cover the 
legs of the wearer and were once held together by an underlayer 
of leather covering the backside and groin. The underlayer has 
rotted away to scraps and the leggings are held together by mere 
vestiges of their former stout construction. The rings 
themselves look to have been crafted by a master. They are three 
layers thick, intertwined cunningly to ensure protection and 
flexibility. Integrated into the weave down the outside of the 
legs is decretive interlocking knot work formed from the same 
steel rings. There are several rents in the mail, scars of 
melted steel, breaks in the rings themselves and other signs of 
extreme abuse.

   Intricate links, small and closely woven, look to have once

neck and shoulders of the wearer it forms a rough cone open at 
the center. Green rotted leather straps, three in a row, the 
buckles missing, look to have once closed it at the back. The 
quality of this steel maille is apparent despite its obvious 
disuse and archaic nature. One section of the gorget looks to 
have been twisted past the breaking point, a rough tear zig zags 
its way from the outside toward the center without breaking all 
the way through. Several of the links appear to have not only 
broken but also melted.

   Maille, looking to have once adored a pair of leather 
gauntlets, hangs here limply, the leather all but rotted away. 
It appears that the gauntlets were masterfully crafted to provide 
supple protection. They are three rings thick at the back and 
comprised of thick rings the gradually taper in thickness and 
width to miniscule single rings on the fingers providing 
protection without compromising flexibility. Several of the 
fingers are missing and appear to have been hacked off. The 
metal itself is corrosion free though the evidence of their age 
is apparent.

A crusty pair of leather boots, draped in archaic maille lie crumpled here.~
   The leather of these boots has hardened with age and green 
verdigris covers their once rich brown coloring. The heels and 
toes are capped in steel cups and hanging from the tops of the 
boots is a thick drape of archaic steel maille rings. The maille 
is cunningly woven to thicken at the edges and sprout form 
between the two layers of leather that form the exterior and 
interior of the double ply boots. How far down the maille 
travels within the boot can be discerned by several patches in 
each boot where the outer leather has been crushed against the 
links. These patches, looking like scales, can be seen all over 
the boots and evidence that a consistent layer of maille has been 
sandwiched within the leather. The boots themselves are quite 
broad and stout.

An ancient, dented-steel heater shield lies forgotten here.~
   Shaped like an arrow head pointed toward the ground this 
shield's body is of a single hammered piece of steel. A ridge 
folded over the edge, riveted through the body and affixing a 
wooden back to the shield is dressed in small ornamental pieces 
of steel maille. In the center, cunningly hammered into the 
face, is a broad decoration of knot work. The wooden back of the 
shield is dried and severely aged. The leather arm straps 
hammered into the wood are stiff and age cracks break their 
edges. The shield appears to have withstood a tremendous 
assault. There are several dents in its face and along one edge, 
over a hand span deep, are several cuts that have split the steel 
and splintered the wood underneath. The edge of these cuts 
appear to have partially melted.

A magnificent, mithril-enruned chest sits here.~
   Extravagantly carved from fine oak, this chest is quite sizely 
and sits about two feet off the ground. A large rounded lid has 
been banded with slender strips of mithril and fastened to sturdy 
hinges of the same exquisite metal. Along the lid and down the 
body of this chest have been etched angular, yet elegant-looking 
runes filled in with shimmering mithril. A thick lock of 
tempered steel allows the lid to be clasped and locked securely 
to the body.

a large circular stone fountain~
A large circular stone fountain sits here in the middle of the cavern.~
   This large circular stone fountain looks to have ceased 
working long ago. It depicts a broad shouldered stout being clad 
in simple clothing and a wide pocketed apron. In each meaty fist 
he wields a tool, the right hand holding a stout hammer and in 
the left he holds a chisel. Sprouting from his chin and cheeks, 
hanging down to his chest is a thick beard. The features of his 
face are set in prideful concentration as he looks down at the 
round basin in which he is set. The figure stands on a base of 
rough hewn stone from which water looks to have once flowed and 
filled the basin.

A rusted iron brazier lies here in a heap.~
   This massive brazier appears to have once hung from the 
ceiling high over head. It radiates many arms that look to have 
housed containers of oil or other flammable liquid. It appears 
that the brazier was designed to illuminate a large area. The 
natural dark color of the metal has been compromised by corrosive 
rust that has eaten its way through the once sturdy arms and 
body. Attempts to lift it or otherwise manipulate the iron 
yields only a handful of rusty red flakes.

jerkin mossy green ARNORIAN_DUNADAN thick battered LEATHER~
a battered jerkin of thick mossy-green leather~
A battered jerkin of thick mossy-green leather lies here.~
   This jerkin is constructed of three sheets of fine leather 
lashed together to provide ample protection. It provides cover 
from the shoulders, where several more layers of leather have 
been lashed together into pauldrons as well as over the chest, 
and down the torso to below the waist. Though it is thick, is is 
quite pliable and provides superior ease of movement. It has 
clearly been put to good use, as it is battered and scuffed, the 
lashing's fraying slightly. Regardless, it is still an extremely 
functional piece of armor, dyed a mossy-green hue.

   Shoddily constructed from several different pieces of rough 
leather, this crude jerkin was not made with aesthetics in mind. 
Several patches ranging from a rusty hue to darker stained browns

Tears and frays weaken the two connected panels that form limited

   This form-fitting hauberk has been formed of thick moose 
hides, with many rows of broad studs covering its length. It is 
a heavily-fortified piece, the thick iron studs lie in rows close 
together and the shoulers have been crudely-lamed with iron bands 
for pauldrons. Though roughly-constructed and quite filthy, this 
hauberk makes an extremely effective piece of armor. Though 
protective, it is quite weighty and hinders the wearers mobility.

   This crude cap has been constructed of the skull of a large 
boar, the bone yellowed with age. Two large tusks jut up from 
the intact lower jaw, which has been nailed to the upper portion. 
The skull is just large enough to sit on the wearer's head, with 
the thick lower jaw bones providing limited protection to the 
sides, though rough leather flaps have been riveted on all sides 
to protect the bottoms and back of the head. It is secured by a 
ratty leather strap with a metal buckle worn under the chin and 
offers no protection to the face of the wearer. This cap was 
crudely crafted with the obvious intent of intimidation over 
excellent protection.

in simple clothing and a wide pocketed apron. In each meaty fist 
he wields a tool, the right hand holding a stout hammer and in 
the left he holds a chisel. Sprouting from his chin and cheeks, 
hanging down to his chest is a thick beard. The features of his 
face are set in prideful concentration as he looks down at the 
round basin in which he is set. The figure stands on a base of 
rough hewn stone from which water looks to have once flowed and 
filled the basin.

leggings up independent of any other garment. The leggings are a

an ancient, decrepit crown made of unpolished gold~
An unpolished, golden crown that is decrepit and archaic lies here, forgotten.~
   Formed into shape in ancient days that are long forgotten, 
this crown of gold was once a splendid creation that would have 
been nigh to unparalleled; yet hard years have fallen upon this 
wondrous work of dwarven grandeur and now the gold is unpolished 
and the gems that once beset this crown are noticeably absent 
from the crown. Dented and scratched, by mishandling, the crown 
is a fallen work of wonder and glory.

decorated the far end of this spoon now only corroded metal 
remains. Despite its state of disrepair the bronze head of this

forged from average, heavy iron, severely blackened in fire, 
reflecting absolutely no glow. The whole edge is serrated, 
except the very tip, which is a keen-edge. The handle itself is 
bone, veined black with age. A length of bloodied, greasy

   A large weapon of war, this battlesword extends roughly five 
feet in total length. The medium-quality iron has been smelt 
down to form a broad blade, its edges notched viciously; they 
maintain a horrific and intimidating first impression. A deep 
fuller has been engraved up through the middle, attempting to 
reduce the overall weight of this impressive sword-- most would 
struggle to hold this weapon in two hands. The handle has been 
wrapped in black leather, the pommel has been hammered down into 
a diamond, dulled off with a file.

capable of holding up to four or five decently sized figures, 
this would be no comfortable stay for anyone trapped inside. Two 
simple planks of wood run horizontally, giving those confined 
within a place to sit.

An iron-reinforced, human-skull pauldron has been discarded here, gathering dust.~
   The back half of the skull has been sawed down brutally with a 
rough tool. Inside, small bands of iron have been inserted to 
reinforce the structure, turning it from a simple skull - into a 
functioning piece of armor. Several straps allow the item to be 
attached securely to a shoulder.

A dry, crusty leather belt lies here, stinking.~
   A single leather strip, this small belt has been fastened 
together by a single rusting buckle. The edges of the belt are 
poorly folded, the material already starting to visibly crack on 
its surface. Although unattractive, this belt looks to be sturdy 
enough to support a few items.

A putrid smell wafts from this surprisingly thin length of 
animal sinew. It is impossible to tell from what animal this 
sinew originates, but it is rather strong for its share width.
The color is creamy pink, veined with black; this mixture of 
color is truly disturbing.

A pair of vicious claws of leather and blackened iron have been discarded here.~
   These are a set of blades fashioned to be worn over the 
fingers, strapped directly to the user's hand and wrist, or over 
armor if necessary. A set of four wicked blades extend from the 
tips of the fingers, sharpened to a razor edge. Attached to them 
is a set of leather straps and buckles that secure them to the 
user's wrist and forearm. Though obviously very unwieldy for 
mundane tasks, these blades give homage to the warg-claws they 
were fashioned to replicate by their nefarious master.

A rotting, rawhide wolf cloak with a spacious hood rests here, crumpled up on the ground.~
   Identified as the rawhide of a wolf, this cloak reeks of rot, 
a pungent odor lingering in its perimeter. The rotting interior 
appears a reddish white, almost pink in color, streaked with 
thick veins of black. The fur exterior is bristly and hard, 
stained with spatters of blood. an overly spacious hood fans out 
overhead, stiff to the brim, enveloping its wearer in total 
darkness.

Sagging from a wooden stand, a tatty banner displaying a crudely-painted black hand hangs here.~
   Hung on a thick-shafted stand of an unidentifiable length of 
wood, this black banner sags depressingly. The poor-quality 
fabric has been dyed a creamy white color, and then stamped 
directly in the middle with a simple black hand. The tips of the 
crudely painted black hand are sharpened, almost like a set of 
razor-edged claws. The stand towers high in the air, slightly 
skewered to the left by an uneven set of legs.

   A once servicable hauberk of some quality has seen decades of 
use and neglect, leaving it stiff and cracked. Holes and tears 
mar the armor, and the hems are frayed. While still offering 
some measure of protection, the dilapidated leather is 
uncomfortable and unsightly with cakes of dirt and dried blood 
darkening it in most places. The smudged outline of a long-faded 
insignia can be discerned on the chest.

   This leather gorget covers the neck, the collarbones and the 
top of the chest. It is made of stiff, boiled leather and 
provides reasonable protection in the places that are not damaged 
by gashes or rotted holes. While once dyed a glossy black, the 
surface is now so dirty and scratched that this color is barely 
recognizable. It fastens at the back of the neck with a row of 
bent and rusted copper clasps. The vague depiction of a white 
tree surrounded by a few stars can be spotted upon the lower part 
of the neck section, half obscured by nicks and grime.

backwards to protect the outside of the wrist, and three laces 
allow it to be fastened to a bracer or sleeve.

providing cushioning and comfort moreso than protection. Rows of 
large, thick iron rings are sewn in into the leather from the top 
of the chest to the waistline, all tarnished to a brownish-green 
color and many missing, dented, or broken in half. The tunic is 
without sleeves or collar, and some of the missing rings have 
been replaced by loops of yellowed bone. Dirt and dried blood 
darkens every crevice and stitch of the armor.

sits in the center of the shield. Two loops of old leather on 
the inside allows it to be secured onto an arm while the hand 
grips a third, smaller strap. Long nicks and indentations give 
the wooden boards an uneven surface.

humanoid dimensions, the walls themselves are nearly fifteen feet 
tall, with a massive doorway set into the front on rusty hinges 
which is at least twelve feet high. A couple of well-armed 
guards stand watch outside the door at all times.

shaped into the form of a large dwarf. The carving is angular and
harsh but evocative, clearly a stylistic choice rather than
evidence of failure. The dwarf is clad in stone mail and on its
chest lay an axe so skillfully formed it is sharp even in aged
effigy. Above an angry, detailed grin are two holes for eyes,
each containing the setting for a gemstone. Upon further
inspection an almost imperceptible seam betrays the lid of this
sarcophagus.

   The remains of this animal have been eviscerated and savaged.
Deep holes the width of an orc's arm are burrowed into its flesh.
It is not clear whether the wounds were sustained in life or
death, though it is certain that the former fate would have
carried with it unspeakable pain. The horror is completed by
an eviscerated underbelly from which hangs its ruined bowels.

a wild assortment of bone piercings~
A series of chunks of bone litter the floor here.~
Many small shards of bone have been carved into defined piercings,
small, curved, and sharp. They seem fit for all sorts of use - some
perfect for the ears, and with small hooks to dangle things upon,
others wider and meant for the nose, and some more generic than
that, just designed to stick in any bit of skin available.

   It is impossible to identify which animal, part, piece or meat

was processed as fodder for something, to allow easy eating or 
shoveling. It smells strongly and possibly has begun to rot

A butchered skeleton from a large boar lies here~
   Bleached by the sun, and worn down by scavengers and weather, 
these bones glisten ominously, serving as a reminder of the size 
and ferocity of the boar that they once served. The empty eye 
sockets still seem to glare around them, searching for anyone 
foolish enough to threaten, and the ferocious tusks that still 
jut out from the jawbone, almost seems ready to dissembowel any 
aggressor.

of bone that runs from the point backwards in an arc that forms a 
wicked barb that is as sharp today as the day it was first made. 
Small traces of old feathers can be see at the end where the 
fletching has been lovingly replaced several times.

A vicious row of sharp teeth, this jawbone carries an air of brutality that is a remnant of the large animal that once wore it. A narrow hilt has been carved into the bone and wrapped in leather for better grip. Thin strips of desiccated meat still holds each tooth in place, and the jagged row makes an edge better suited for ripping than cutting.

murky water. The engraved bowl has been chipped and eroded. 
Little more than a pile of rubble it has been left to the ravages

A single, large piece of red-tinged bone makes up the chestplate
of this suit of bone mail, elegantly carved into the shape of a
torso. It is very much lighter than any metal piece, albeit a
little thicker and more likely to stand out at distance. There
are no markings of any kind upon its front, and on a normal wearer
it will appear very bulky indeed.

A large skull is resting here, hollowed out and reinforced in the shape of a helmet.~
This helm is a pale red in color, clearly crafted from the skull
of some very large creature, and this makes it sit very unusually
upon any normal bearer's head owing to its size. It is reinforced
internally with a circlet of bone leading to supporting segments
inside, allowing it to be worn as a normal helmet, giving the 
wearer the appearance of an enormous head. Nevertheless, if the
skull is half as protective as it was for its original owner,
this will be a remarkably protective helmet

slightly recurved towards the back end of the hilt to provide a
pleasingly long cutting edge, razor-sharp and formed of tough,
pale red bone. The hilt is formed of the same material, the two
sections to the weapon flowing seamlessly into one, with a narrow
crossguard for parrying and a backward-tapering hilt. It is an
entirely unmarked piece.

A crude longsword with a wooden hilt is here.~
   This crudely forged longsword has a slightly dull edge, but it 
could still deliver a fierce blow. The pommel is made of iron 
and fashioned with the likeness of a wolf on it. The right side 
of the iron crossguard has been broken off. The hilt itself is 
made of a sturdy wood with several nicks in it.

vambraces UNIQUE_PSHIJJAKRU spiked heavy banded iron METAL~

A heavy banded pair of spiked iron-vambraces lie here.~
   Riveted in a clean seam over a base of well-cured boar hide is 
the second protective covering of this multi-layered set of 
protective armorment. Cast of a medium-grade iron which has been 
further hardened by some strange ingredient added to the 
finalized product, a keen eye in metalcraft would clearly be able 
to decipher this as the art of an orkish craftsman. Many hours 
have been poured into this extremely sturdy garment as over a 
leather-and-ring base, a series of articulated banded iron straps 
have been set in place to leave very little room uncovered from 
harm. The only true weakness could be best deciphered by 
possibly slipping a knife or a spear through one of the tightened 
straps but it seems about as likely as trying to pound it through 
without the strength of the strongest of men. A menacing pair of 
spiked iron-vambraces complete the skull exhaling flames which 
spiral and fade into the dark and slightly burnished metal.

greaves UNIQUE:PSHIJJAKRU thick spiked pair iron banded METAL~
a thick pair of spiked iron-banded-greaves~
A thick pair of spiked iron-banded-greaves lie here.~
   Articulated series of banded iron-plates have been woven 
beneath thick, spiked iron thigh-guards to a base of well-cured 
boar hide and wide ringmail to produce a very effective and heavy 
set of leggings. Molded to finish just beneath a knee-guard set 
into place with a series of precisely hammered bolts and hinges, 
it effectively allows a measure of movement beneath such 
absolutely clunky armorment. Intended for only the strongest of 
men and even orc, a keen eye to metalcraft would easily decipher 
this as the work of an orc, noted by the strange properties which 
have taken place in the relatively mediocore-quality iron ore; 
hardening it into place somehow. Set to protect the shins and 
calfs are expertly crafted spiked greaves which leave the 
faintest of gap between a series of straps that appear to off 
around the ankles, an ability in the design to tighten the 
garment. Inscribed with great detail and care; a orkish skull 
exhaling spiraling flames can be seen on the greaves themshelves, 
fading into the dark and burnished iron.
