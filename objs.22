   Made of light, quilted leather, this surcoat doesn't offer 
much in the way of protection from the elements, mostly intended 
to identify the wearer's affiliation. It is a long panel of 
cloth that hangs down the front and back of the wearer, with a 
hole in the middle for the head and neck to pass through. On the 
front and back is appliqued the symbol of a dark shield within a 
grey Full Moon - the heraldry of Eradan, Lord of the Emyn Arnen.

a heavy, high-backed war saddle~
A heavy, high-backed war saddle has been left on the ground~
   This finely-crafted saddle has been fashioned of thick, 
durable leather and dyed the deepest of blacks. With a high 
front and back, the saddle is ideal for keeping a fighting man 
mounted, while the pommel provides a location to hang sword or 
reins. An open cup attached to one of the easily adjustable iron 
stirrups offers an easy place to rest a lance while riding. 
While the saddle is oiled and appears well taken care of, it 
never-the less displays scratches and signs of heavy use. Upon 
each side of the saddle, the Grey Moon emblem of Lord Eradan has 
been emblazoned in silver.

leather strap so that it can be securely fastened to the hand for 
better grip.

   Sewn of sturdy wool, this surcoat falls in folds from the 
shoulders of the wearer. The greater body of the surcoat is dyed 
a pristine, azure blue with the notable exception of a pair of 
triangular panels on each side of the garment. Stabbing upwards 
to hip level, the triangles are formed of inset, red wool, adding 
flow and shape to the form of the garment. Likewise, the lower 
hem and collar of the surcoat are trimmed with red wool. 
Featured prominently upon the left breast, standing out in 
contrast to the azure colour below, is a many-speared red 
sunburst, rays flaring outwards a handswith. Upon the red sun is 
a spread-winged, azure falcon, completing the emblem of House 
Sindbar.

battle-ready statue soldier STONE~
a statue of a poised warrior~
A statue of a battle-ready soldier is here, shield raised to the east.~
   This person - frozen in flawless marble - is poised for 
battle. Grasped firmly in its right hand is a longsword, and in 
the other a roundshield is held defensively. The soldier's 
stance is sustained with difficulty; gashes, cuts and slashes mar 
its armor - yet the figure stands dauntlessly. A seemingly 
easterly storm is throwing and tossing its cloak about in a 
violent flurry of fabric. The warrior's hair is worn loose and 
several locks are visible under a helmet with a long nose guard. 

A bronze plaque is attached to the base of the statue.

little care to defensibility or organization. Large fire pits

even a troll or two are visible moving through the camp.

a wooden-walled compound~
A wooden-walled compound is set here, banners at each corner.~
This compound is the result of a large amount of effort, its
perimeter large. Wooden walls, about the height of a troll, protect
those within from danger. A single small gate has been carved out
of the palisade. Coming from within are the sounds of a large
force, metal clanking against metal, voices shouting in a gutteral
language. Sentries man the gate, their orcish forms straight
against the wooden stakes of the wall.

rope and nails to two very thick and long ropes - akin to ship 
rigging. A third rope runs above these, offering a way of 
pulling across any length spanned. Either end of the cumbersome 
and heavy rope bridge is a grappling hook. A small release rope 
stretches the length of the contraption, presumably placed so 
that a strong tug releases the hooks from whatever they are 
attached to.

a swing. Whatever it wielded is long broken off, as is the arm
itself past the elbow. It holds in its other hand a human head
by the hair, somehow not broken by time and weather. The troll's
expression is truly hideous, its fangs bared in a snarl and its
face devoid of all thought or introspection.

their deaths violent and harsh by the look of the way they are 
sprawled. Some crumbling armour that falls to pieces when 
touched show signs of the White Tree of Gondor or the stars of 
the Steward of that place. Others seem to be of recent Haradrim 
descent judging by the moons on the crushed and useless shields

   This rather hard-used rabbit toy gives off a particularly 
forlorn aura, with its stained coat and black button-eyes. The 
fur, legitimate rabbit fur, is coated over in several places with 
a series of black stains, causing the fur to clump together and 
having dried hard. To one with expertise or knowledge, these 
stains would be recognizable as blood. Thread whiskers protrude 
from the toy rabbit's muzzle, drooping limply. Atop the rabbit's 
small brow someone has sewn, with intimate care, the word 
'Narthanwen' onto it.

a rage-toned, feline-pupiled glass eye~
A rage-toned, feline-pupiled glass eye lays here.~
Inserted in place of the lacking of a real eye, this glass eye would be inserted into the flesh of the wearer's face in the hole left behind. It is obviously high quality work, the glass smooth and flawless. However, what truly makes this glass eye a work of art is the way that the glass, and the ruby, has been instilled into the midst of it. The glass in the middle of the eye has been faceted, directly behind a small, ruby crystal. Whenever the light would shine into the eye, it would hit the ruby and then the glass behind it, before refracting back out--casting the illusion that red light is spilling through the feline pupil detailed on the front.

   A hardened, oak battering ram, the pointed head covered with a

a heavy beam mounted above. The head of a huge, iron pick is 
firmly bound to the oak ram, re-inforcing the iron clad head. 
The heavy beam is supported by several stout timbers forming an 
A-Frame-shaped structure. The sides of the structure have been 
covered with lumber that has been in-turn covered in hides while 
the front and back of the structure are open-ended, allowing the 
men inside to swing the ram the full length of the chains by 
pulling on the rope attaced to the backend, exerting a temendous 
force when swung forward.

a large, fortified camp of Southron soldiers~
A fortfied camp of Southrons is set here, sentry towers posted along its walled perimeter.~
   This compound is the result of a large amount of effort, its 
perimeter large. Wooden walls, about the height of a troll, 
protect those within from danger. A single small gate has been 
carved out of the palisade. Coming from within are the sounds of 
a large force, metal clanking against metal, voices shouting in a 
foreign tongue. Sentries man the gate, their tall forms straight 
against the wooden stakes of the wall. Banners flying the 
insignia of the Reflected Moon clan are set about the camp.
