linen, gold tassles hanging from its lower corners. Worked in 
golden yellow fabric, edged with gold stitching, the stylised

stakes driven into the ground at different points to support 
their weight and stop them from tumbling down and crushing 
everything in their path. A great majority of the logs are huge, 
their great bulk proving difficult for a grown man to reach 
around fully.

a freshly built, large military warehouse with wide open double doors~
A freshly built, large military warehouse with wide open double doors and a short path leading inside sits just off the southeast corner of the Great Crossroads.~
   A large warehouse has been recently built here in haste. Pine 
lumber has been nailed to oak posts to form a temporary 
structure. Great double doors are strapped open with rope coils 
and soldiers of the Steward stand guard around it. The entrance 
though seems welcoming as many people are filing in and out. As 
they go in they drag with them small pushcarts laden with 
jewelry, old helms and weapons, clothing, hides, even some bring 
barrels of salted meat and carts bearing lumber and granite. 
When they leave, they are empty-handed. Inside can be seen 
soldiers dragging anything they are given into piles and then 
sorting them into long rows of shelves and crates. Soldiers call 
out for you to come and give anything you can, even the smallest 
item, to aid the war effort! You can "enter" the "building" to do 
that.

shortbow finely made recurved yew wood bow PRIZE_GREENFEST WOOD~
a uniquely-carved, recurved, yew-wood shortbow~
A uniquely-carved, recurved, yew-wood shortbow lies here.~
   This exquisitely-crafted shortbow is made of the finest 
materials. The bow itself is made of the highest-quality yew 
wood. The wood is quite stout, having a strong natural 
resistance to bending. Brown leather, soft and supple, is 
wrapped around the middle of the bow, serving as a hand grip. At 
both ends the bow curves back on itself, and a taut bowstring 
made of braided linen is stretched between the ends. 
   The entire length of the bow has been decorated with scenes of 
the Hunt, which are burnt in place then painted and stained. A 
stag stares back over its tall shoulders with antlers proudly

a finely made, enscribed longbow~
A finely-made, enscribed longbow rests here.~
   The bow is made of high quality seasoned hardwood, good and 
pliant, with a slight polish that makes it gleam. The ends of 
the bow, where the string goes, are lightly carved with a 
diamond-shaped pattern, and the handle is ornately turned and 
wrapped with dark green leather strips. A series of amber gems 
have been set along the bow, representing the eyes of creatures 
struck by arrows. Orcs, wild trolls, Haradrim cavalry, all fall 
before the wielder of this bow. An enscribed symbol of a sword 
and stars, the mark of Great Lord Astirian, finishes off this 
exquisite weapon.

a silver-capped, dark-brown-leather quiver~
A quiver made of dark-leather with a silver cap has been discarded here.~
   The bottom of this quiver is capped with silver which is 
smoothly woven into a fine, dark-brown leather. The weaving of 
the leather on this quiver is tight, but gives slightly when 
pushed upon. The top of the quiver has a silver ring around the 
brim. The strap is made of the same, fine leather. A silver 
sword is set halfway down the quiver, crested by stars, marking 
this as crafted by the Great Lord Astirian's own leathersmiths.

a uniquely-carved, recurved, yew-wood shortbow~
A uniquely-carved, recurved, yew-wood shortbow lies here.~
This exquisitely-crafted shortbow is made of the finest 
materials. The bow itself is made of the highest-quality yew 
wood. The wood is quite stout, having a strong natural 
resistance to bending. Leaf green leather, soft and supple, is 
wrapped around the middle of the bow, serving as a hand grip. At 
both ends the bow curves back on itself, and a taut bowstring 
made of braided linen is stretched between the ends.
Finely crafted carving picks out the figure of a hunter, back
taut, bow raised, arrow nocked and aimed at some unseen target
far off across open countryside. Gold leaf picks out the high
relief of the carved wood. At the very tip of the bow sits a small 
sword and stars insignia of Great Lord Astirian.

A large glass bowl filled with plantlife and #4water#2 housing #5a small, green frog#2 is here.#0~
   Within the confines of this large, deep bowl has been arranged 
what appears to be a miniature forest floor. Over a layer of 
dirt lies a soft carpet of moss, broken by a few spike-leafed 
plants. A large slab of rock, also covered in moss, has been 
propped up against one side, creating a sort of cavern beneath, 
camouflaged with more leafy green plants. Smaller rocks and 
chunks of wood are littered throughout the structure, and to 
another side there is a dish of clean water. Here and there, 
crickets can be seen wandering about. The inhabitant of this 
makeshift forest scene is #5a small, green frog with orange 
toes#0, but a good #6view#0 of the creature requires close 
examination, for its colouration causes it to occasionally blend 
with the plantlife provided for it. If you look closely, you can 
see the #6frog#0 much better.

is extremely light with dwarven runes etched carefully along
it's length and ending in a thinned, flat base.

reveals that this is in fact an elvish blade, with the sigils 
'Anglachel' inscribed on its blade. Stronger than any steel, 
this blade is made of black iron meteorite; its edges kept razor 
sharp and shine with a pale fire. It's hilt has been carefully 
wrapped in supple, black leather and provides both a comfortable 
grip, and a firm one.

   This skirt appears to be crafted from elemental fire, woven 
into a silken-looking fabric, soft to the touch if not for its 
blistering heat. It is ever shifting, dancing and flickering, 
and radiates a soft glow about itself. The full skirt, which 
sweeps the floor and sends sparks flying upward upon contact, is 
gathered at a wide band of tailored flame that is designed to sit 
low on the hips. The garment emits a soft crackling noise, and a 
haze lingers on all sides of it, a testiment to the calidity of 
the vestment.

A mithril-slatted warfan of #1pure flame#0 lies here, emitting a soft glow.~
   This weapon is as beautiful as it is functional. It is 
comprised of eight slats of mithril, each one foot in length, 
held together at the base by a sturdy peg, over which are 
stretched a taut length of fabric. This fabric is not ordinary, 
however, in that it appears to be elemental fire woven into a 
sturdy, silken material that still crackles and dances with the 
light of unharnessed flame. The weapon can be used for blocking 
and bludgeoning when closed, as well as provide a distraction and 
some cover for subterfuge when opened. It does not serve much 
use as a regular fan, in any case, for it is heavy and bears a 
blistering temperature, making it far too unbearable for mortal 
hands to manage.

   This statue seems to be made purely of diamond. It depicts a 
wingless, fierce looking dragon on all fours with its maw held 
wide open. One of the three pieces of this statue that isn't 
diamond, are the glittering rubies that rest in its mouth, each 
faceted masterfully and glimmer in any light. If one was to look 
properly at the statue, they would see that it has thousands of 
small black diamonds studded over its surface. Two large rubies 
symbolize this dragon's fiery eyes. This statue is beyond the 
skill and resources of mortal men.

   Forged of purest mithril in the heat of dragon fire, this 
chestplate is incredibly light for how very solid it is. The 
unadorned, fire-blackened mithril has been tailored to fit a 
specific form-- namely female, from the looks of it-- and extends 
only to the bottom of the ribcage, making maneuvering about in a 
flexible manner quite easy when worn.

   This thick gold armband coils like a snake around the wearer's 
upper arm. The armband has been designed to look like a long 
thin stick of rhubarb with leaves and all. Upon the surface in 
bright pink letters the words "Rhubarb's Property-you has been 
warned!" have been masterfully engraved.

A gold, heart charm bracelet is here.~
   This gold bracelet has been masterfully made. Upon first 
glance the metal looks shiny and very well polished. Though upon 
closer inspection, the image of a shadowy creature with and oddly 
shaped head can be seen. Its large horns protrude with their 
tips curling down alongside its face. Even the fiery red eyes 
can be seen as flames rise around it. Where the clasp meets a 
heart charm bracelet hangs with a simple engraving of 
"Valarauka's Pet"

A mithril-slatted warfan lies here, emitting a strange crackling sound.~
   This weapon is comprised of eight slats of mithril, each one 
foot in length, held together at the base by a sturdy peg. It 
can be used for blocking and bludgeoning in its current closed 
state, and it is heavy and bears a blistering temperature, making 
it far too unbearable for mortal hands to manage.

A dragon fountain arcs water gracefully through the air into a pool.~
   A marble and granite fountain of a dragon stands to full 
height with its wings towards its back, water flowing from its 
mouth and cascading into the pool at its base. The stone is so 
well crafted it looks real, and its gem-like eyes seem to follow 
those that dare to come near. Its arms and hands are open, as if 
waiting to strike, or pull someone protectively into its embrace. 
A plaque set into the pool reads "Beware foe; Welcome friend"

   A broad, flat head houses two large, orange eyes with black

the frog's flexible, extendable tongue. Its hind legs, which are 
streaked with blue, are disproportional with the muscle housed 
within, tapered with webbed feet, the orange toes of which end in 
little glistening balls. Its skin has a moist, sticky-looking 
sheen to it at all times.

   Within the confines of this large, deep bowl has been arranged 
what appears to be a miniature forest floor. Over a layer of 
dirt lies a soft carpet of moss, broken by a few spike-leafed 
plants. A large slab of rock, also covered in moss, has been 
propped up against one side, creating a sort of cavern beneath, 
camouflaged with more leafy green plants. Smaller rocks and 
chunks of wood are littered throughout the structure, and to 
another side there is a dish of clean water. Here and there, 
crickets can be seen wandering about.

   This leaf green skirt has been made out of mithril. The 
material is incredibly lightweight, and so thin that it is almost 
see through. Even in the faintest of lights this garment has a 
shimmery look to it. The skirt sits low on the wearer's hips and 
only goes down to just about an inch above the knees. Whenever 
the wearer moves, flashes of the upper legs are revealed through 
side slits that are not seen when standing still, which also 
serve to lessen any hindrance to movement.

   These pants are incredibly tight and form fitting, leaving 
very little to the imagination. They are buttoned closed with 
small mithril buttons, which glimmer in the light. The leather 
itself that makes these pants seems to have been made of dragon 
hide, with the beast's scales still intact on it, providing ample 
protection. They come down to the wearers ankles, molding to 
their skin. The pants themselves appear to be expertly made, 
providing both ample protection to the wearers lower half, as 
well as a fashionable, if rather bold, look.

writing, 'Taken fresh from the throat hole of Glaurung. Keep 
away from children, side affects may include: Nausea, vomiting, 
exhaustion, death. Only for external use, if swallowed, call 
poison control' Inside the vial itself, there is a bright pink 
liquid that looks to be slightly thick and rolls easily over the 
glass. At the top of the vial it is sealed with black wax, 
bearing the stamp of a wingless dragon.

and to it's lopsided antennae. The fine limbs and details of the 
moth are flat against the moth's fat body so they wont break. 
Tarnished and worn, the silver appears old but still retains some

   This exquisitely-crafted shortbow is made of the finest 
materials. The bow itself is made of the highest-quality yew 
wood. The wood is quite stout, having a strong natural 
resistance to bending. Rich brown leather, soft and supple, is 
wrapped around the middle of the bow, serving as a hand grip. At 
both ends the bow curves back on itself, and a taut bowstring 
made of braided linen is stretched between the ends. Worked the 
length of the bow are intricately intertwining vines. Flight 
arrows slip between the vines, each set of finely carved flights 
dusted with silver leaf. At the very tip of the bow sits a small 
sword and stars insignia of Great Lord Astirian.

head of a stag is carefully carved, twelve-tined antlers 
magnificent above a finely etched head. The lower limb is

leaf. An enscribed symbol of a sword and stars, the mark of

this item is the fact that the padded seat is adjoined, allowing 
the opportunity to rock back and forth or just be able to rest in 
comfort. The rounded head of the cradle raised slightly higher 
than the other sides, where the intricate carving of a fox curled 
around a longbow can be spotted, looking down upon its would-be 
occupant, ever watchful.

An exquisitely-crafted, white-oak reflex bow lies here.~
   This shortbow is of incredibly exquisite make, composed of the 
finest materials and formed by a master craftsman. It is 
composed of the highest-quality white oak, and uses dense horn 
and sinew in its construction, to form a solid and resilient 
composite form. It bends outward away from the wielder when 
unstrung, and as such, provides incredible draw weight, and would 
require a very strong user to operate properly. It bears thin 
strips of soft scarlet leather about the center of the bow, and 
the string is composed of tightly-braided linen, and seems to 
have been solidified with a lining of sinew. Its make is precise 
and masterful, and it would likely be a formidable and lethal 
weapon in the hands of a skilled user.

enclosed bookcase stands taller than most Men, allowing for many 
volumes and curios to be proudly stored and displayed within. 
Two doors, meticulously carved and detailed into the form of a 
large, leafy tree overlay two large panes of fine, sage green 
glass allow the owners collection to be locked away, via an 
expertly-wrought lock embedded within the woodwork, towards the 
middle of the trunk. On both sides of the case are large oaken 
posts which have been carved with an inward curve, serving both 
as further complementing the overall aesthetic and granting the 
piece further stability, making it almost impossible to move 
alone with ease. The entirety of this work has been smoothed and 
shined to enhance the overall look and feel.

smooth arch, the legs and outer edges of the curve are 
meticulously carved in numerous stylized roses; buds, blooms, 
leaves, and thorned stems, which are accentuated by the naturally 
reddish undertone of the wood. Although the wood is naturally 
weather resistant, its entire surface has been stained as further 
protection against the everyday exposure to the elements. While 
the design is sturdy, the many minor nuance of the bench shows a 
great deal of care and attention to detail and comfort, lending a 
slightly more delicate appearance.

a pair of silver bell earrings~
A pair of silver bells on wire lay here abandoned.~
   These two delicate earrings are comprised of silver bells upon 
silver wire, with fishhook-style clasps backed by a small silver 
clasp that can be twisted over fine threads etched into the 
metal, to keep the earrings from falling out. They dangle down 
to the wearer's jaw and jingle with even the slightest of 
movement.
