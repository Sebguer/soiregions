longknife SIMPLE_QUALITY slender iron METAL~
a slender, iron longknife~
An iron longknife with a slender blade lies here.~
   This weapon is about two feet in length, similar in 
construction to a shortsword. Unlike a sword, however, the blade 
is only sharpened on one edge, therefore making the weapon an 
oversized knife. Curving only slightly toward the tip, the blade 
is otherwise straight and forged of quality iron, non-edged faces 
smooth. The hilt is carved simply of rowan, with a crossguard to 
protect the hand in battle and a pommel to counterbalance the 
weight of the blade.

   Light and well-balanced, this weapon would work well as a

easily carriable. Its hilt is carved of dark maplewood and is 
expertly attached to the slender steel blade, which is edged on 
one side and tapers slightly toward the point.

A sheer white silk dancing skirt lays here.~
   Many yards of whisper-soft, filmy white silk chiffon are sewn
into this dancing-skirt. The skirt's flaring panels are gathered
to a contrasting waistband of heavier silk that hugs the hips,
buttoning on the side securely. Though sheer, there is more than
enough fabric gathered to the waistband that it is more than
adequate coverage. The lower hem of the skirt is neatly, narrowly
hemmed, reaching to just above the ankles.

A finely-crafted battlesword crafted of thick, dark iron lies here.~

and sturdy and the hilt is made of fine iron held in place by 
strong screws, with a pommel of heavy brass to counter-balance 
the blade.

An iron platemail gorget set with a fang lies here on the ground.~
   Fashioned from two sheets of metal, this gorget fits tightly 
about the neck, designed to ward off blows aimed at that crucial 
part of the body. The iron alloy is easily polished to hold a 
bright shine, and is tough enough to ward off all but the most 
critical of attacks. A strip of leather acts as padding for the 
interior of the gorget, and a series of holes punched in matching 
ends of the two separate pieces of metal allows the neckpiece to 
be fitted. A fang has been set into the metal of the gorget.

a tray filled with straggly marigold plants~
A wooden tray filled with straggly marigold plants sits here.~
   Rectangular in shape and fashioned from wood, this tray is 
filled with fertile soil and marigold plants. The basal leaves 
of the plants are spatula-shaped and stalked, while the stem 
leaves are lance-shaped and attached directly at the base. The 
straggly, dark-green leaves and stems of the plants are roughly 
hairy. The once yellow-orange flowerheads have shrivelled up, 
turned brown and gone to seed. Several clusters of curved brown 
seeds can be seen at the end of the dried stems, waiting to be 
collected.

A snakeskin satchel is laid aside here.~
   It is a well-made satchel crafted of snakeskin and lined in linen.
The skin is iridescent, each scale glossy, and while over time it will
go dull, especially if not cared for, now it is in excellent shape.
The dark lining is carefully sewn to protect the scales as much as 
possible. It closes with a buckle and strap, and slings over the shoulder.

An emerald pendant on a gold chain is coiled here.~
   A faceted emerald pendant dangles from a finely worked gold chain
necklace. The stone is a brilliant green, almost fiery at its heart,
with well-cut facets that show off its shine. It's of a good size,
well proportioned to be a pendant. The chain is rollo style, each
link worked exquisitely, with a clasp in back to hold it closed.
It's an elegant and striking piece of jewelry.

a mangy, severed paw~
The severed paw of some small animal has been discarded here.~
  The sleek forepaw of a rabbit or similar creature has been
severed cleanly at the wrist-joint and fashioned into this crude
fetish. Mottled grey-white fur sheds readily, though it appears
able to do so for some time. Curved, dim-grey nails terminate the
end of this hardened, arched foot. A short sleeve of fur extends
beyond the wrist to which a narrow leather strap is attached.

A healthy almond tree grows here.~
   This is a small many-branched tree. The bark is smooth and a 
dark purplish colour. The leaves are long and narrow attached to 
their twigs by long stalks. The leaves are green and remain so 
even during the autumn months prior to their abscission. Spring 
yields a wonderful flourish of bright white flowers, clustered 
for added impact. There are many stamens and the golden anthers 
complement the white petals. Growing from the tree are ovoid 
shaped grey-green fruits with a tough leathery skin and covered 
in dense hairs. During the autumn months this splts to reveal a 
whities inner surface.

detailing along its sides of mountain forests, the stylized scenes
deep and darkened in their recesses to bring out the detailing. One
side features a new range, craggy and "snow"-topped; the other features
an older, more rounded range, but both are thick with trees. Four
large onyx stones are set along the bracelet, to delineate each
scene; each stone is glossy-black and rounded, and each seems to draw
in the light that hits it. The pure black stones form an elegant and
striking contrast to the bright gold. The bracelet slides on over the
hand, and is more than thick enough to be worn by a man or woman.

a finely carved oak weapon-rack~
A finely-carved oak weapon-rack stands against the wall.~
   This large, heavy weapons-rack is made of fine oak, stained pale
and carved all over its surface with geometric designs that play
about its grain. The wood's flawless, and each join is crisp and
tight. The rack is set with a number of ornately-carved settings of
various sizes, intended to be used to store weapons from daggers to
halberds. The entire piece is man-sized, tall and substantial, and
elegant with all its little touches. Its craftsmanship is superb,
the work of a carpenter with experience.

midnight-blue, lion-embellished suede boots~
A pair of lion-embellished, midnight-blue suede boots are set here.~
   These supple boots are made of soft suede dyed a deep midnight blue.
They have padded soles and a very slight heel, and look like they were
made for comfort as well as style. On the outside of each boot, near
the calf-high top, is a silvery-grey medallion sewn securely, each
medallion tooled with the stylized image of a maned, fierce lion, the
feline features clear despite the medallion's palm size. Each lion
is depicted crouching as if to pounce, the haunches gathered like
coiled springs. The outer edges of the medallions are worked with
silvery thread. These are well-crafted boots, the work of a master,
snug and water-resistant, and comfortable enough to walk in.

knife SIMPLE_QUALITY skinning wide METAL iron~
a wide, iron skinning knife~
A wide, iron knife rest on the ground, neglected.~
   This knife's iron blade is somewhat wider than the norm and 
slightly curved. The lack of crossguard seems to indicate that 
this is more a tool than a weapon. The blade is very sharp and 
apparently well kept, with a design optimized for skinning. 
Leather has been wrapped around the hilt tightly, allowing for a 
close, manageable grasp while working with it.

a red-hot long iron brand~
A long iron brand lies here, glowing red hot.~
   The metal of this long brand glows red-hot, almost more orange 
than red. The only thing protecting the user's hand from certain 
severe burns is the length of the rod, and the handle wrapped in 
leather. It would be unwise to touch the heated end of this 
instrument.

along the stem of the pipe. The pipe is lit, and the bowl is 
lightly smoldering.
