a crude wide skinning knife~
a crude wide iron skinning knife lies here.~
   This wide-bladed knife is made of crude, black iron. With a 
handle built with rough wood screwed to the hilt, it sports a 
long fuller running from the middle of the blade to the handle, 
lacking a cross-guard. Apparently used for skinning animals, the 
iron appears rusted and the blade dulled, testimony to the lack 
of consideration that this tool seems to receive.

a long, curved knife~
A long, curved knife with an iron blade lies here.~
   The blade of this long knife is curved and forged with pitted 
iron. The edge was apparently made by filing it with some tool 
rather than sharpening, which yields it a somewhat serrated 
aspect. With a small copper guard, the hand is unprotected 
against an enemy strike. More of a tool than a combat weapon, 
the blade appears sturdy enough to cut through flesh.

a serrated, bone-hilted iron longsword~
A dark iron longsword with a serrated edge is set on the ground.~
   Five foot long and straight, this blade is fashioned of dark 
iron into a functional and harsh weapon. With a hilt of fastened 
bone, a crude cross guard and short quillons, this is a simple, 
crudely fashioned example of the orkish foundries. Besides the 
damage it would deal on itself, its maker serrated the edges, as 
to deliver a grievous, evil wound. This lends a horrific aspect 
to the blade, but clearly diminishes its overall endurance.

a wide-bladed, iron shortsword~
A sword with a wide blade of black iron lies discarded.~
   More akin to a shortsword than anything, this sword is made of 
thick, hammered iron, which has become dark and rusty. The blade 
is wider than the ones usually seen in this type of weapon, and 
ensures a long, gaping wound. Used for thrusts, the hilt is but 
a piece of wood bolted with screws. The hand is somewhat 
protected by a seemingly strong cross guard, fashioned from the 
blade itself. Engraved into the iron, the symbol of a fiery, 
lidless eye betrays the orkish origin of the weapon.

A sword with a curved blade of black iron has been left here.~
   Forged of simple iron, this weapon is long and functional, 
with a curving blade that allows its bearer to deliver fast 
slices to his enemies. Despite this, the edge appears dulled and 
hardly dangerous, forcing the wielder to rely more on strength 
than skill. A perpendicular strip of metal has been melted into 
the leather-wrapped hilt to serve it as a cross guard.

long heavy cuff made of tough leather and reinforced with iron 
connects to the iron parts of the gauntlets. There is little 
even in the black, harsh iron surface of the plates.

combination of edge, weight and skill of the owner. With a 
strong cross guard and secure wooden handle, the overall

   Heavy and almost as tall as a man, this two-handed sword could 
conceivably cut through the heaviest armour in the hands of a 
strong wielder. Forged from dark iron, it has been kept free of 
rust with care, its edge sharp enough to easily draw blood. The 
quillons are long and sturdy and the hilt is made of wood held in 
place by strong screws, with a pommel of heavy brass to 
counter-balance the blade. The symbol of a fiery, lidless eye is 
inset near the cross guard.

   With a thick blade and almost six foot long, this weapon is a 
fearsome one, designed to kill or maim easily. Of dark iron, the 
edge is sharp, but certainly the damage is caused from the 
strength of it's owner and the overall weight of the weapon. Set 
near the hilt is a strong cross guard, made of polished copper, 
that matches the dark leather wrapping the handle tightly. 
   On the pommel, a heavy medallion counterbalances the swing and 
depicts a fiery, lidless eye, betraying the origin of this blade.

the club to the owner's wrist.

crescent blade with a skilfully crafted empty space between the 
handle and the edge. The space lends the weapon a somewhat 
fragile appearance, but the weight and expertly fashioned edge 
quickly erases such idea as well as to make clear that the wounds 
given by this axe will be either fatal or grievous enough to maim 
an opponent. The handle is carved out of white birch with a long 
strip of leather wrapped tightly to it, securing the grip needed 
to use this weapon properly. Hanging from the end of the handle, 
a few leather strips hold small teeth and bones, brutal trophies 
from the victims of the axe.

The wood has darkened from use, and the light tinges of rust have

subtleties, this weapon is a savage example of the orcish war 
forges. Three thick and sharp spear heads have been forged 
together, made of black iron, lending this weapon a mace-like 
appearance due. However, the joining point of the blades is 
pointed and sharp and will surely make a devastating wound, 
combined with the wielder's strength and the small point of 
pressure. The shaft is very long and has been totally wrapped in 
black leather to ensure good grip.

   Heavily rusted and dirty, this weapon sports a heavy axe head 
with a spike on top and on the back, set on a crude pole of dark 
wood. Closer examination reveals a set of thin lettering written 
on the metal. Use and neglect has turned what may have been once 
a proud insignia or owner's motto into an undecipherable 
scribbling. The metal used is apparently steel, which has 
sustained misuse and lack of maintenance, dulling its original 
lustre and edge. The pole is apparently newer than the blade, 
which has been strongly fastened to it. Despite the sorry state, 
this weapon still can deal a devastating hit in the hands of a

without care or thought. Good for a scuff or a light hit, it 
might not stop heavy weapons or a skilled swordsman. However, it 
might turn an otherwise lethal wound into something manageable.

barbaric implement of war, probably crafted by some barely 
skilled armour smith. A red-dyed lidless eye can be seen amongst 
the dirt and filth matting this vest, revealing its origin.

vest studded leather crude LEATHER~
a crude studded-leather vest~
A vest crafted of bleached leather with iron studs lies crumpled on the ground.~
   The simple design of leather armour has been reinforced 
somewhat by the addition of several dozens of round iron studs 
which have been attached to the leather, leaving only small 
intervals without iron to protect. At shoulder height, a set of 
holes have been drilled and secured, apparently meant to attach 
sleeves to the vest. Providing fair protection from a stray blow 
that overcomes the shield or parry, the crude manufacture of this 
vest does not assure safety to the owner if a full force blow 
hits. It will surely spare from a fatal wound, but certainly 
will give way to a heavy-edge or blunt attack.

a pair of crude rawhide leggings~
A pair of leggings made out of rawhide are piled on the ground.~
   Nothing but a set of long pantaloons made of rawhide, this 
stiff piece of armour is meant to be worn over some kind of 
softer clothing, as the barely tanned hide will surely chaff and 
bother anyone using it. Providing with decent protection from 
the threats of wilderness travel, these leggings will surely 
buckle if pressed by a weapon. They may somehow lessen the 
damage inflicted, but nonetheless, despite their thick 
appearance, the safety provided will be fickle at best.

of brimstone. Old haradrim women are often seen washing clothes 
and gathering water for the kitchen table.

it together in the center and forms a halo around the rest of the

stray sword or axe blow aimed for the top of the head or the

   The long haft of this axe easily allows room for two hands to 
grasp the weapon, making any other usage seem awkward and clumsy. 
An iron head sits atop of the oak handle, a circular blade 
curving out from either side. While not extensively sharpened or 
prepared from any but the most mediocre quality iron, this 
battleaxe is still a fearsome weapon with the sheer weight and 
momentum it carries with its swing. A few dark-looking runes,
sigils of skulls and other symbols of Mordor, are set in the middle
of the axe's broad head.

has sharpened expertly to a near razor-fine edge. An elegant 
cross-guard made of artfully dulled bronze is set above the fine 
maplewood hilt, protecting the wielders hand and wrist from 
damage. Thin black leather thongs have been wrapped around the 
hilt, providing a secure, solid grip.

   Constructed of dark timber, this fair-sized raiding vessel 
likely belongs to one of the feared Corsairs of Umbar. Heavy, 
black sails still flow freely in the air despite numerous tatters 
and burn spots. The deck of the black raider has also been 
punctured in places. Emblazoned upon the sail is a single red 
dagger with the curling hilt poised to strike. A forecastle 
stands toward the back of the ship, the timber planking around it 
damaged, likely from a siege weapon in battle. The ship itself 
seems to sag unnaturally in the water, making it look as if it 
may have sprung a leak.

An elaborate Haradaic carpet colored in exotic colors lies upon the floor.~
   An elaborate intercourse of exotic, bright colors forms a 
delicate, overly detailed pattern spread over the surface of this 
large Haradaic carpet. There is a shaded golden spiral design in 
each corner, which flows into a complex network of smoothly 
intersecting vines. A delusive background image, colored in a 
mixture of heavy dark blue and a rich scarlet, depicts a pair of 
bear-like creatures wrestling each other. The frayed ends of the 
carpet are clasped with small ivory rings rimmed in polished 
gold. The fine silken strands, still glistening with the 
freshness of the dye are very appealing to the eye, and extremely 
soft to the touch. The carpet itself isn't overly thick or 
sturdy, suggesting that it is meant as more of a decorative piece 
than a doormat.

The edges are frayed, with each of the small bouquets of loose 
strings bounded by a small, polished ebony bead.

are varying interlocking patterns of shades of black and white, 
creating a mild dizzying effect. In the foreground, a long 
serpent twists and spirals across the entire carpet, with its 
head managing to have caught its own tail. The serpent's body 
gradually changes from a light $color at its head, to a dark 
$color at its tail.

of a vest, on which what seems to be several plates of metal have
been sandwiched between layers of leather. The plates have been
held together by angular bronze rivets set in a way to form a
geometrical pattern. The vest has been ingeniously worked to allow
a wearer ample flexibility of the arms and waist. A solid plate of
mirrored iron has been affixed on the upper chest area, offering
improved defense against blows aimed at the heart. Three bands
of worked iron make the pauldrons of this solid vest, offering
augmented safety for the shoulders, as well as allowing mobility for
combat.

armor, a series of rivets can be seen sticking up from beneath
the leather strips that cover the front of the vest, hinting at a

masterful protection to the shoulders from downward strikes. A
single mirrored plate has been attached to the left breast of
this unusual jerking in order to protect the heart from arrow
fire. And set on the chest are a pair of silver stars, bounded
at the lower left by a small, golden crescent moon.

   This spear's shaft, about five feet long, is ridged at 
periodical spots in a way that indicates bamboo as the base 
material rather than wood. It has been dyed a midnight black 
which contrasts sharply with the pure white of the ivory 
spearhead. This blade is quite long, just over a foot and a 
half. It appears to have been carved from the tusk of some great 
animal and has been sharpened to a very fine slashing edge and 
jabbing point.

weapon such as a scimitar or similar weapon, though it could be 
used for all manner of other blades as well. If fastened 
properly, it keeps the dangerous blade out of the way of careless 
movement, but still leaves it open to the elements. A small 
emblem has been etched into the front side, bearing a silver 
crescent moon encircled by a black snake.

dyed an even sand tone in hue. They lace up the front with 
strong leather cords, and belt-loops are stitched sturdily around 
the waistline. The cuffs are slit up until mid-calf, with laces 
strung through them that can be adjusted to a comfortable 
snugness. Small, decorative crescent moons have been branded 
into the leather around the edges of the cuffs, then dyed a soft 
silvery hue. Another silvery crescent moon appears on each of 
the leggings' thighs more like an emblem, encircled by a black 
snake.

a sturdy, sand-hued leather vest~
A sturdy leather vest dyed a sandy brown lies on the ground.~
   This vest is an example of fine craftsmanship, made of a 
supple, yet thickly protective leather dyed an even sand-brown 
tone. Unobtrusive loops around the arm-holes are designed to 
allow sleeves to be tied on, and the front of the vest laces 
snugly up the front, with a thinner leather backing behind the 
laces to provide modesty for female wearers. A crescent moon is 
branded onto the back, dyed a soft silvery hue with a black 
serpent encircling it.

A flowing, gauzy gown of $color cotton lies here.~
   This long gown is made of just-barely-opaque $color gauze
cotton, with fitted sleeves that flare from the elbow, a keyhole
neckline that can be buttoned or unbuttoned, and a floor-length
lower hem. It is fitted through the torso, flowing down from

edges not even hemmed aside from the neckline, with a decidedly
foreign look to it.

   This helm combines lightness with mild protection, made of 
sturdy sand-toned leather that has been lined on the inside with 
soft cotton to soak sweat and provide comfort and padding. It 
snugly covers the top of the head and most of the back, but 
leaves the face open. On the inside, a crescent moon encircled 
by a serpent has been clearly branded into the leather, marking 
it property of the Silvermoon armies of Haradwaith.

A pair of strappy sandals sit here, decorated with brightly colored beads.~
   These sandals are decidedly feminine in nature, soled with 
thin but sturdy, well-tanned brown leather. Several thin, 
criss-crossing leather straps allow the sandal to simply slide 
onto the foot. The straps are strung with brightly colorful 
beads, none of them exactly alike in pattern or color, and they 
almost completely hide the leather straps themselves. Attatched 
near the ankle are two soft leather ties, dyed bright red, that 
serve to wrap around the calf and secure the sandal.

and a silver buckle on the ankle-strap allows one to adjust the 
fitting to almost any foot.

wishes. It fastens down the front with large, bright glass

collar, and lower hems are decorated with similar beads, though 
they are much, much smaller in size, helping to weight the 
otherwise extremely light garment.

as a string on this shortbow is a piece of catgut, which is 
wrapped around each tip, causing the bow to curve slightly. The 
shortbow appears to be stout and skilfully made.

A pernicious cutlass with a sliver hilt is set here.~
   Measuring about three feet in length, this cutlass is of skilful 
craftsmanship. Its blade is perilously keen along its lower 
edge, and tapers to a sharp point, its surface polished to a high 
sheen. Its smooth basket hilt is fashioned of gleaming silver, 
sweeping elegantly out and around the leather-wrapped handle to 
protect the hand, joining again at the pommel. It is both light 
and well-balanced, and in the hands of an adept swordsman, this 
cutlass would deal out great damage.

A pair of dark bronze scalemail leggings lies here.~
   A myriad of sharp, diamond-shaped bronze scales have been 
fastened to the thick leather of these protective leggings. Both 
front and back of the leggings bear scales, though the knees are 
covered by a single, larger plate of bronze to allow some 
flexibility. The scales stop just above the calves, leaving room 
for the leather to be tucked into a pair of high boots.

   Heavy bronze plates have been neatly riveted together to

quilted leather. The only weakness in the entire piece is the 
back of the knee joint, where the exposed leather allows the knee

robe is so heavily embroidered in sweeping, fluid designs that 
its color is almost lost. It is worn open down the front, but 
can be caught by a belt. Its long sleeves flare to the wrist, 
while its lower hem hits about calf-length. A shawl collar, left 
plain except for delicate embroidery at its edge, circles the 
neck and all the way down the front. It is a dramatic, decidedly

   The long, glossy blade of this flamberge sword twists back and 
forth like a razor-edged, black steel serpent, ending in a thick 
tang that disappears into the crosspiece. The crosspiece is of 
twisted steel ending in a spike on the back, the front bending 
towards the pommel and spreading like a reptilian wing into a 
half-basket to provide protection for the hand. The cats-head 
pommel bears a small, red hand emblem and is black-glossed brass, 
providing an excellent counterbalance to the blade. This 
longsword is forged of the finest steel, and its edge is deadly 
keen.

A gem-studded bronze anklet lies here.~
   This anklet is more like a bronze cuff, made of two piece of
curved metal that clasp together at one end securely. It can be
adjusted to fit snugly. Set along its length in channel-set grooves
are many cabochon-polished semiprecious gemstones, such as carnelian,
sardonyx, turquoise, black onyx, agate, jasper, and others, set
without much of an eye for coordination. The largest stone is a
black onyx, polished to a mirror sheen and attached to a pendant
dangling closely from the anklet like a tag.

a screen of woven $finecolor linen and bamboo~
A two-part screen made of $finecolor linen and bamboo divides the room.~
   This two-part screen is connected by leather lacings and framed in
pale sprucewood. Strips of bamboo create an open weave through this

woven with $finecolor linen accented with all kinds of riotous colors,
creating a sort of woven checkerboard of wood and color. Light filters
through the cloth, given an impression of movement and shadow through
the barrier, but little else.

A three-part screen carved with a delicate star stands here.~
   Three panels, connected with bronze hinged fittings, framed in
cedar, the thin sandalwood sheets that comprise it have all been
carefully scrolled out with six-pointed stars and key designs. The
result leaves a sense of near-translucency, enough of the form remains
to block clear sight, but enough has been cut out to allow small bits
of what lays beyond to be perceived and hinted at. If draped with an
with an appropriately gauzy cloth, it would create a functionable
barrier through which only the sense of movement and shadow could be
detected by the passing of light through the cut designs.

scales, each boiled in wax to make it more durable. Boiled leather
elbow cups and layered leather pauldrons provide protection for the 
joints, and the brace of them are designed to be buckled to a cuirass

they are light-weight, comfortable, and provide considerably more
protection than leather sleeves alone.

in elegantly draping folds.

around the sides, covering only the sides of the bust and just cupping
enough up the front to give support and offer a small nod to modesty.
Thin, delicate straps reach up to tie behind the neck, and another set, 
just beneath the bust, mark the bottom hem of it and tie behind the back.
Sleek, tight-fitting and exceedingly revealing, this top reveals far
than it leaves to the imagination. It is dyed $color, with contrasting

A gossamer thin kamis, with a $finecolor silk yelek over it, lies pooled here.~
   Buttoned at the neck with a gold flower-carved bead, and falling
all the way to the ankle, this gossamer-thin silk chiffon kamis is 
made of whisper-soft pale fabric. Its sleeves, loose and slightly
bloused, terminate at the wrist in a stiff cuff of gold-embroidered
linen, heavy weight and curving up to a point on the top of the hand.
The embroidery is more rounded, flowing, and forms a blooming flower in
the middle of the stiff cuff.  It clings to the skin, soft and draping,
giving just a hint of what lies under it.  Covering this risque sheath
is a flowing, heavier-weight silk yelek, dyed $finecolor. Little more
than an open front and side vest on top, connected around the waist
into four unconnected pannels of the skirt-like lower half, it is
sleeveless and open down the front, the vest-like upper portion just
barely providing a degree of modesty for the bust. Made of a rich
$finecolor silk, it is embroidered in indigo, with an intricate flower
pattern. It falls in panels around the clinging skirt of the kamis. Each
panel is decorated with a delicate blue cutwork of flower blossoms,
matching in color the wispy kamis under it.

   This blouse is made of light, flowing silk dyed $finecolor,
with a deep v-neckline that dips quite low. Hardly modest, this
garment billows seductively with breezes and movement, with long
gathered sleeves that end in narrow cuffs. Tracing the soft edges
of the neckline and cuffs is pale silver embroidery, while the
small, nearly unnoticable stitches are clearly the work of a master
clothier. The lower hem is rolled and reaches mid-thigh.

An iron helm shaped like a wolf's head is set here.~
   This durable iron helmet is forged and worked into a wolf's head
form, the brow sweeping down into a nasal and shaped like a wolf's jaws,
set with wolf fangs.  The cheeks come forward, angling slightly to protect
part of the face and add a representation of the lower jaw, while the top
angles up and back with a ridge on each side to complete the look.  The
whole thing has been polished then burnished, giving its surface an almost
fur-like sheen.

A finely-made steel war-club has been set here.~
   This rather vicious looking weapon, around three and a half feet
in length, is made from steel and shaped somewhat like a club. Upon
its face are spikes, varying in size, from smaller studs closer to
the handle to large, protruding spikes at the top. The handle of this
weapon is made from maple hardwood, wrapped carefully in fine black
leather to allow for better grip, while the fine brass pommel is joined
to the bottom of the handle, giving the weapon some aesthetic beauty as
well as acting as a counter-weight for the large club-like haft.

rivets, holding in place a number of sturdy, rectangular metal plates.
Simple, durable and effective, they look like they would provide good
protection for the feet and calves, while still being lightweight and
comfortable. There is no room in them at all to hold anything, but the
protection they afford offsets the lack of storage.

A shining steel cuirass of articulated plate bands lies here.~
   This cuirass is made of a large, well polished steel mirror
plate, affixed to which is a graduated set of steel bands, curving
around the torso to affix to smaller plates under the arms. Bands
go, in turn, to another large plate at the back, creating a formidable,
light and flexible defense against any sort of attack. The bands are 
riveted to each other, layering vertically, each rivet setting through
an oblong hole in the one above it to allow them to move. The result
is comfortable articulation without loss of protection, like the tail
of a lobster. A set of buckles under the left arm allows it to be taken
on and off very easily. Buckles at the shoulders allow it to attach
to sleeves, giving seamless coverage, while the plates fall down below
the waist, to attach over leggings to leave no gaps in protection.
All in all, it is a powerful, comfortable suit of steel armor.

allow the rivets to slide a bit and letting the bands articulate without
creating gaps in the solid steel sheath of protection it offers. Strong
and light, this leg armor looks like it would provide exceptional
protection.

A black leather collar set with a silver wolf's head is set here.~
   Measuring about an inch in width, this delicate collar has been
made from soft and supple calf hide, richly sueded to ensure comfort.
Dyed deepest black, its edges have been over-stitched with black thread
to provide both reinforcement and a bit of decoration. The front is
set with a masterfully-fashioned silhouette of a wolf's head in 
silver. A small, highly-polished tigers-eye gemstone has been set
into the head, gleaming darkly like a sinister golden eye. The
collar clasps in the back by way of a dainty silver buckle whose
two ends narrow slightly. Overall, its purpose doesn't seem to be
either jewelry or protection, but rather to mark the wearer as a
slave in the possession of someone specific.

already garishly embroidered and ornamented overcoat.  Long sleeves
are split along the top all the way to the elbow and stiff with
embroidery and cutwork, falling down over the arms.  Open
down the front and split up the sides as well, the intricately-
patterned panels swirl and drape as the wearer moves. It is sewn of
white wool in neat stitches, in excellent workmanship.

a ghawazee coat of $color wool~
A ghawazee coat of $color wool is here, ornately embroidered.~
   This woman's overcoat is made of warm, thick wool and absolutely
slathered in swirling cutwork and intricately-designed embroidery
in fluid designs. Open at the throat and across the chest, a tight-
fitting choli scoops the breasts and adds contrasting color to the
already garishly embroidered and ornamented overcoat.  Long sleeves
are split along the top all the way to the elbow and stiff with
embroidery and cutwork, falling down over the arms.  Open
down the front and split up the sides as well, the intricately-
patterned panels swirl and drape as the wearer moves. It is sewn of
$color wool in neat stitches, in excellent workmanship.

An embroidered beledi of fine, white linen is set here.~
   It is a long dress with open, draping sleeves that are tight
at the shoulder but taper open to the cuffs, which are loose enough

flaring at the bottom to make it swirl as the wearer walks.
It is sewn of fine white linen, and makes a graceful silhouette
that emphasizes the curves without revealing much.

An iron-headed arbir with an ash haft is set here.~
   This five foot long pole-arm has a broad, single-edged head like
a halberd, with a long red-painted groove running up it to help
the wielder determine where the cutting edge is.  A double-edged
spike protrudes from the top, and a flanged butt-spike helps counter
the weight of the head and gives the wielder something to strike with
against an opponent at close range.

   It is a thirty inch long, eight inch wide ceramic cylinder made
of white clay and engraved with black geometric designs. It has been
carefully inlaid with mother of pearl. The head is made of goat-skin

widening out at the bottom to be the same width as the head. It is
designed to be held off the ground, either between the legs or under
one arm, with the tone varying considerably by how close to the rim the
head of drum is struck.

   This stand is roughly man-shaped and made of fine maple.
A center pole with two inverted "V" shapes to simulate arms

and efficient. It can easily support a full or half suit of 
armor, and has been affixed with short stands on either side.
One is a rectangle, leaning towards the center, to mount a
shield on, the other is an inverted "L", from which a sword-belt
can be hung and with a fitted spot for placing a spear.

   This small box is carefully and delicately carved with floral designs,
twisting over and through its surface, giving small glimpses of what
lies within it. The soft scent of the fragrant wood clings to the box
as well, the blond finish lending the little box a very feminine air.
Set with brass fittings and an ornate little locking clasp on the front, 
it seems like a beautiful choice for holding a lady's valuables jewelry.
Inside it has compartments lined in soft fabric, some obviously meant
for rings, some for longer pieces.

The half-mask bears no eyehold, revealing nothing of the features beneath.

An exotic, bronze-chased war-horn is laid here.~
   This impressively constructed horn is adorned with a bronze mouthpiece
that is carved and filigreed in a style instantly recognizable as Eastern,
possibly Haradaic, to anybody vaguely familiar with those cultures. The
horn itself is pale ivory in color with dark-brown streaks, and is glossy
with lacquer. It curves and expands slightly all the way to its hollow
end, which is itself rimmed in matching filigreed, carved bronze. Its
shoulder-strap is woven of strips of cinnamon- and emerald-green leather
in a repeating design chased in metallic gold and bronze. If blown, the
horn issues a high-pitched, exotic-sounding tone that grows in intensity
from nearly-too-low-to-perceive to a deafening sound.

   #6Slaving, buying and selling:#0 

The NPCs here are not interested in buying PC slaves; you'll have 
to find a buyer amongst PCs, or train them yourselves. 

Certain types of NPCs can be sold here at the Slavers. To test 
it, simply type "sell slave". If it works for the slave type, it 
works. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Don't petition up asking for 
special cases of slaves to be sold for you; they won't. 

Four types of NPCs can be bought here; goblin and human house 
servants which will automatically flee from combat if engaged, 
making them useless, and orc and human bodyguards. These are 
randomly generated mobiles conditioned to be loyal to your PC, 
and offered for convience's sake instead of waiting for an admin 
to make a custom NPC for your character. If you still want or 
need a custom NPC, send an email to staff+morgul@middle-earth.us, 
the asking prices being 750 for a household NPC, and 2000 for a 
bodyguard NPC.

   However, some of it is intelligible, and reads as thus - Type
'request food' and 'request clothes' to stay fed and clothed
during your stay in the jailhouse. For those wishing to leave,
be advised that if you're in this room, you made someone very upset
ICly, and nobody is allowed even to visit you in here until that
someone has seen to you. This is a room for people who have committed
very serious crimes, not a regular jail cell.
 
Please email staff(at)middle-earth.us to make contact with whoever
put you here to arrange for RP times, or else you can hobbitmail
whoever put you here if you know his/her name. Please be sure to
include your account name and PC name with all correspondence to staff.
 
   For now, enjoy the rich adventure of sitting in the *special*
jail cell.
 
   Pleases be advised that being imprisoned, particularly in Mordor,
may involve torture or other objectionable roleplay. As is stated in
our game policies, located at:
 
http://www.middle-earth.us/index.php?display=policies#objectionable
 
if you do not wish for such roleplay to proceed, please
requestfor it to stop via OOC, and the enforcer that is
administering it will stop. Any violations of this will be
punished most severely.

a heavy black silk overcoat~
A heavy overcoat of black silk is laid here.~
   Layers of fine, ebony silk have been cut and stitched to form
this heavy, straight-cut overcoat. Reaching to the mid-thigh, this
warm garment is made with both practicality and fashion in mind,
with thick sleeves that graze the hands of the wearer. Deep, 
linen-lined pockets are sewn onto the front so that they drape
over the thighs, and dark, jet-black obsidian buttons run upwards
from hem to throat, to a plain standing collar, enclosing the
overcoat snugly about the wearer. The tailored cut emphasizes the
wearer's shoulders and waist; on an athletic frame, the garment 
accentuates the body's musculature.

a form-fitting grey wool overcoat~
A grey woolen overcoat lies here.~
   Stitched of fine, charcoal-grey wool, the severe cut of this overcoat
reforms the body of the wearer into sharp lines and angles, eliminating
any softness in their form. A narrow, folded collar extends down to the
breastbone, and a set of small, onyx buttons run up the front, holding
the material together with the aid of a strip of fine, black leather that
cinches about the waist. Smaller onyx buttons close the plain cuffs, 
keeping them unwrinkled and stiff.

unadorned and each perfectly cast.

a thick, engraved battle-sword~
A thick, engraved battle-sword with a heavy wooden pommel lies here.~
   With a thick blade and almost six foot long, this weapon is a 
fearsome one, designed to kill or maim easily. Of dark iron, the 
edge is sharp, but certainly the damage is caused from the 
strength of it's owner and the overall weight of the weapon. Set 
near the hilt is a strong cross guard, made of polished copper, 
that matches the dark leather wrapping the handle tightly. 
   On the pommel, a heavy medallion counterbalances the swing and 
its former depiction has been replaced by a white tree of gondor.

Plain, efficient metal shoulder pauldrons are riveted into the

arm, protecting the sides. A fourth plate, as large as the front 
one, is attached around the back, riveted into the hauberk and 
set among the iron scales. The combonation, while heavy, is a 
bit lighter than plate itself and provides a remarkable amount of 
protection. The breathability of the ventilated leather and 
movement of the scales makes it far more comfortable to wear.

a steel-bladed goddara with a bronze hilt~
A fine, bronze-hilted goddara with a long steel blade is here~
   The three foot length of this blade is nearly three inches 
wide from tang to just before the tip, where it tapers roundly to 
a slashing point. The end of the blade curves a bit and is 
double-edged, allowing for some thrusting, but only the top 
quarter of the back of the blade is sharpened, the rest left wide 
to provide more support for the brutal slashing style this sword 
is best at. A quarter-basket hilt with a bronze bar curves over 
the grip to the pommel, where a red tassel hangs, ornamenting 
this fine weapon. The basket itself is engraved lightly, the 
blade unornamented save for having been polished to a mirror 
shine. The edge is well honed and with the thick support and 
wide fuller, allows for brutal cutting force.

is fashion from a series of thick brass hoops, overlapping and
moving in a somewhat jerky fashion. Far from a piece of fine

piece of brass lets it cover one's shoulder.

   Linked together by two tough leather straps, these pauldrons 
are designed to sit on both of one's shoulders, warding off 
blows. Yet, the flaring curved and jagged spike that faces out

not weapons of war, but tools of spectacle. Judging by their 
somewhat battered and dented nature, they are certainly well 
used, not matter what their purpose.

a series of straps running along the lower half and allowing it

of many a savage blow.

   Made of solid steel and laquered a glossy black, this formidable
breastplate is cut all in angular lines. A diamond-edged pattern of
a muscular human chest and abdomen akin the to gender of its wearer
covers the front, save where a lightning bolt is etched in bright,
silvery nickle. Two sharp-edged pauldrons protect the shoulders 
and a pair of half-inch wide, four inch high crests come from just
above the breast to just above the shoulder-blade, front to back, 
to keep blows from skidding off the pauldrons towards the neck.
The edges are all fluted out to deflect blows away from the joints
and allow for a wider range of movement and edged in shining nickle.
It is of exemplary design, obviously created by a smith of great
skill.  The inside is padded with leather and quilting and it 
attaches under the left side with three nickle-plated bronze buckles.

of a dozen orcs in heavy armour, or at least look like it, the 
stout wooden frames of some dark, strong wood that seems 
resistant to whatever either the elements or any single humanoid 
could throw at them. Reachng rather high, they rest here in the 
ground at a slightly slanted angle, their sturdiness increased by 
the pair of long iron spikes at one end that has been driven deep 
into the ground.

farmhouse razed blackened shell OTHER~
a razed farmhouse~
The blackened shell of a razed farmhouse looms here.~
   Untamed grass grows freely about this portion of the northern 
reaches of Ithilien, yet the picturesque countryside is ruined by 
the charred shell of a large farmhouse that juts out, the 
blackened stone base mostly intact, a short growth of fire 
ravaged wood reaching a few dismal feet into the air. Odds and 
ends of farming equipment litter the soot and ash ingrained stone 
floor, from crisped pieces of leather to old scythe heads twisted 
by the fire that tore through the farmhouse. In all directions 
the fields of Ithilien run.

a farmhouse painted a drab $color~
A farmhouse painted a drab $color rises above the Ithilien here.~
   Constructed from a stone foundation and a wooden exterior, 
this double-storey farmhouse rises high into the air, the heavily 
barred shutters and stout door testament to the troubles and 
perils faced by dwellings such as this in the lands of Ithilien. 
An ancient, flaking coat of $color paint covers the wooden planks 
of the farmhouse, yet while the outward appearances of the 
building may have be left to the elements the structure looks 
rather sturdy.

   This large square of silk has been dyed a rich azure in 
colour, the outer edges of the bandana double stitched with a 
gentle thread of blue a shade darker. The centre of the bandana 
has been decorated with a large, sinuous serpent, mouth agape in 
a snarl rendered in intricate embroidery of silver and gold 
coloured thread. Sleek limbs are outstretched, talons artfully 
depicted in the two colours against the darker silk as the long, 
serpentine body of the dragon curls and twists, occupying much ro 
om on the bandana.

to be placed right over the face of the wearer with holes for both eyes
and mouth, the latter large enough to allow the user to eat and drink
while wearing it. A black silk cord runs behind the wearer's head to
secure the mask snugly to their face.

a row bloodied stakes arrayed before a number of cages~
A row of bloodied stakes, many bearing heads upon them or raven-picked skulls upon them, run down one side of the path through the Arena Square here, a number of cages suspended from stout wooden poles hanging behind them.~
   Long shafts of dark wood jut out from the dirt ground here, 
many topped with the heads of those caught by the Black Watch in 
violating the Witchking's Law, others ominously clean and blank 
for the moment. No small amount of the heads are now reduced to 
yellowed skulls, picked clean by the flock of predatory birds 
that hops from fresh head to fresh head, picking and tearing away 
at the rotting flesh. Behind the semi-circle of heads stands a 
number of cages, mewling, crippled forms both human and goblin in 
appearance bound within them, suspended off the ground. Frail 
legs and arms dangle through the heavy iron bars of the bloodied 
cages, accompanied by the occasional call for help or mercy as 
passing denizens in the Arena Square stop on infrequently to poke 
and tease those trapped inside.

   What was once a fine sculpted fountain of stone has been 
reduced to a large cracked circle of rock, black water pooling 
amidst the many chips and fractres from some underground seam, 
overflowing during rainfall and spreading out onto the dark 
ground of the Arena Square. In general, the majority of denizens 
gathered beneath the shadow of the Arena give it wide berth, the 
pieces of rock that reach out from the putrid sludge covered in a 
foul-smelling mold.

Arena Square, the many stooped, cloaked and discrete figures 
murmuring all sorts of wild, outlandish manner of tales amongst 
themselves, watching warily any that try to insinuate theirselves 
into the conversations. Yet, the odd figure can be seen to deal 
with the secretive rumour mongers, trading in blacks for scraps 
of rumours or stories of the more plausible bent.

A small, saw-toothed brass key lies here.~
   This is a small brass key, not more than a few inches in 
length. It has a small beaten and flattened section on the 
non-head end with a thin hole drilled through it, allowing for it 
to be held and put on a keyring. The key's teeth are joined 
together on a hanging head, and look rather like saw blades, 
being angled oddly.

An uncured hide collar has been dropped here.~
   A collar made of several small animal furs, uncured and still 
giving off an odor of decay. Bits of rabbit fur, beaver hide, 
and various small animal skins have been crudely stitched 
together with sinew and strips of the hide used to bind it around 
the neck. While infested with fleas and giving off a malignant 
odor, it seems like it would provide a reasonable degree of 
protection.

A black-bladed warsword with silver crossguards lies here.~
   Measuring six feet from tip to pommel, this slender blade has 
been forged with the greatest of skill and care. Forged of steel 
coloured jet black, an intricate scene of battle has been 
engraved roaming down the blade, featuring a stone fort at the 
tip and a horde of orcs led by a crest-helmed figure at the base 
of it. Sharpened at both edges to a razor fineness, the warsword 
is perfectly balanced where the blade meets the hilt, two silver 
crossguards extending out half a foot from each side of the 
sword. The end of the weapon is topped with a weighty silver 
pommel, the handle in between dark wood wrapped in black leather.

The dark grey rock is engraved with a series of geometric patterns that run
along the back and sides, up and down the legs and across the armrests. The
seat is fairly low to the ground, the stubby legs seemingly built that way
rather than damaged. Several small nicks and scars are visible on the surface
of the chair, but none that would be considered disfiguring.

it, depicting grizzled, bearded faces, are cracked and worn, but 
it is still possible to see that great care and skill went into 
their creation. The table itself stands fairly low to the

agents rubbed into the metal bring out the detail, making them look
from another whole age.

consisting of extensive tengwar, and many other symbols. It has 
been highly polished, and bears very few marks or dents.

beautiful, grim cuirass is formed of two pieces, meant to enclose 
entirely about the torso. A series of holes about the upper rim 
are meant to attach to a gorget and the two plates are held 
together by numerous black leather straps and buckles, meeting 
together to leave nothing but the smallest seam. Embossed upon 
the front of the darkened, shadowy steel in black is a fell 
beast, its massive wings spreading out to the sides and its 
terrible head reared back, maw opened to reveals rows of vicious 
teeth. Surrounding the creature on all sides are countless faces 
of men, women and children, each alike only in the expressions of 
pain and torment they hold, lips curled away from teeth and 
mouths wide in frozen screams.

iron-maiden maiden iron ornate huge PEUSTICE METAL~
a huge, ornate iron maiden~
Propped up against a wall, an iron maiden with an ornately-wrought image is here.~
   Around eight and a half foot tall, three feet wide, and an 
equal distance deep, this Iron Maiden could accommodate quite a 
large victim. Made of a solid black iron, it has been carved to 
take the general likeliness of a woman, her cold, unmoving eyes, 
open wide in an expression of frozen terror the only part of her 
features that belies anything but pristine serenity. The chest 
of the iron-maiden opens up in two sperate halves, the inside of 
which houses the fitting for the many long, sharp spikes, fully 
adjustable and moveable. One half can be opened up while the 
victim is still impaled on the other half, allowing for secure 
viewing of the subject. When closed, it is entirely soundproof 
and lets in no light, enclosing the victim in their own private 
agony.

A stained, flare-sleeved dress of fine linen lies here.~
   This elegant, long-skirted dress made of luxuriously fine 
linen which flows in natural, gentle undulations from the hips. 
The bodice hugs the bust and waist, creating a modest neckline, 
and features a line of exquisite silver buttons down the back. 
The garment's fitted sleeves flare deeply below the elbow and 
reach the wearer's wrists.
   The gown was once pristine white, but now is stained with
dirt and sweat that no washing could remove; it is obvious that
it has been worn for hard work and daily wear for some time.

an expertly-crafted, serpent-hilted scimitar~
An expertly-crafted, serpent-hilted scimitar is here, its fine blade reflecting light brightly.~
   Made of fine-quality steel, this robust blade shows excellent 
durability. It possesses an extremely fine edge, that has been 
expertly honed to perfection. A deep, though fine groove leads 
through the blade from its cross guard to tip along the sleek and 
continuous curve of the scimitar. The groove widens fractionally 
as the blade grows wider and the curve takes an upward route to 
the fine point, the edge however continuing along a short curve 
in the widened section of the blade. The cross guard made of 
quality light-weight iron with the depiction of a serpent 
twisting around it. The hilt is wrapped in supple leather, 
ensuring a good grip. Overall the sword is well balanced, and 
its sleek form shows that if in the hands of a skilled user could 
be a very dangerous weapon.

a cruel, crescent-bladed halberd of dark iron~
A cruel, crescent-blade of dark iron lies here affixed to an oak pole.~
   The blade of this weapon has been crudely forged from dark 
iron. Its edge is not smooth but jagged, giving it a serrated 
edge. Roughly crescent in shape, this dangerous blade curves 
down to where it rivets into a thick oaken shaft. Both ends of 
the oak has been capped in similarly dark iron, the butt blunt 
while the tip tapers out into a long needle-pointed spike. What 
wood that remains visible was been stained near black with sweat, 
blood, and any of the other byproducts of battle.

A crudely-sewn, rat-hide mask lies here crumpled.~
   This gruesome mask is made entirely from parts of a rat. The 
majority of the mask is made from the hides of an assortment of 
large, flea-ridden rats. It is sewn together roughly and messily 
by a long, waxed thread, and the heads of the skin are at the 
bottom, where one sticks its head in. Around the head is sewn 
three tails of rats, each overlapping each other slightly for a 
morbid flair of decoration. The eye holes are just jagged holes, 
made with a crude piercing weapon. There is no mouth or nose 
holes, but the base of the mask is large enough for air to get 
in, depending on the size of the wearers head.

strapping on the sides with thick buckles. Dark iron plates, 
roughly beaten into wide strips, have been rivetted in place to 
add protection, but the worksmanship is quick. The plates rattle 
when worn, scraping against each other and making a generally 
irritating racket.

the cost of some protection.

metal runs mitten-like from the back of the hand to the tips of 
the fingers, allowing a grasping motion but little else. They 
strap securely at the wrists with buckles.

at the expense of some protection.

A long slit is cut for vision, and a series of holes punched 
around the nose and mouth for ventilation.

#9A notice to new players is here. Read it by typing 'look sign'.~
   If this is your first time in Minas Morgul, you are highly 
suggested to spend roughly half of your starting money in the 
following rooms, buying your character a suit of armours and a 
trusty weapon or two. Minas Morgul is a rough and violent place, 
and people that enter the city without arms or armour are 
presumed by the denizens there to not only be an easy target, but 
an easy target with plenty of money. Thus, taking the time to 
get suited up head to toe in leathers and with a sword strapped 
across your back is not only an excellent way to ward off the 
more desperate attacks, but also advertise you may not be packing 
all that much money after all.

a sigiled steel halberd~
A steel halberd is here, sigils covering part of the shaft.~
   This halberd has been forged from high-quality steel, seeming 
to be well-made. There is a large almost axelike head to it with 
a curved slope, on the top is a long spike, the back holds a long 
hook with a sharpened edge perfect for pulling shields back or 
dismounting a mounted opponent. The edges have been beaten so 
that it would only take a little sharpening to keep a good edge 
on it. The haft is around ten feet long made from sturdy oak, 
the top fourth seems to still be black. Upon the blackened 
section deeply carved upon it are numerous sigils, though what if 
any meaning they have is far from visible, and they seem to lack 
even the most basic of pattern or style to them. There is also a 
small carving of a wolf upon it.

and would repel rain if required to. A crude burlap strap has 
been attached to one side, several holes punched down its length, 
and on the other side of the blanket a flimsy iron buckle has 
been attached. The strap is obviously intended to be secured 
about the underside of a mount, and the blanket used either 
underneath a saddle or in place of a saddle entirely.

   This crude mask is made of thin, hammered iron. Speckled with 
small patches of rust and darkened areas, due to the low quality 
of the crafter and of the metal, this can, nevertheless serve 
fittingly to hide the face of the bearer. A pair of simple holes 
have been made to fit the eyes and a larger one below allows one 
to speak and breathe. A pair of crude leather laces permit this 
to be strapped to the face, although this would be only for 
masking the identity of the bearer, not a protection in combat.

This creates a diagonal line in the front and back of the skirt. 
In the back the skirt forms tightly to the buttocks and reveals 
almost all the thigh. The bottom hem is dyed differently than 
the rest of the skirt, it matches the thread and is dyed a strong 
gold. At the top there is a small slit about three inches long 
and is down up by a bronze button. This revealing silk skirt 
doesnt do very good job of protecting ones legs but is made as 
small and tight as possible to emphasize a womans form.

a leather saddle, decorated with skulls hanging by leather cords~
A leather saddle, decorated with skulls hanging by leather cords lies here.~
   This saddle is of crude but effective design, made to fit over 
a warg's back and bear a rider upon it. It has been crafted from 
ordinary, dark-red-dyed leather stretched over a wooden frame 
that has been shaped to take in account the warg and rider. 
Yellowed skulls decorate the sides of the saddle and hang from 
the saddle-horn, which has been wrapped by a coil of hemp rope.

   This thin $finecolor silk veil covers the wearer's face from 
just below the eyes to well below the length of the throat. 
Though the material is thin and light, it leaves little of the 
face visible save a the eyes and lends a mystique to what lies 
beneath it's silky elegance. It is held in place by a long silk 
tie on either side which ties behind the head and is worn over a 
veil and beneath a hijab.

shaped with style and comfort in mind. Made of elegant, 
flawlessly dyed velvet stitched effortlessly to a soft hide

that reaches up the boot to end in soft linen trim, they reach to 
the calf and conform to the leg slightly. On the top of these

scarf is knotted at each end. Easily tied about the upper arm, 
face or to bundle up one's hair, this piece of linen has been 
crudely painted with a black-hued skull and crossbones. Blazoned 
across the center of the scarf, the jolly roger is clearly 
visible regardless of how it is worn. In some places the color 
is starting to fade and the cloth is lined with several small 
cuts and nicks, hinting at many years of use.

threading through the membrane around the smoothly painted wood. A skull

The curved blade of this weapon is about three feet long and flares out towards its sharp tip. Streaks of rust, blood, and scars mar its surface and is covered with a mottled patina. A simple brass hand guard replaces the cross guard and pommel to protect the wielder's grip on its cord-wrapped hilt, the guard also lined with a few scars. Despite its derelict state, its edge is scoured to a keen edge. Its balance and heft lends to hacking and slashing instead of thrusting.

falling to close and tighten together at the mid-abdomen with 
laces. Along the V neckline, sharp fangs have been sewn onto the 
leather, giving it an odd sort of style.

of the cap upon the inside, warg fur has been attached for added 
warmth, a bit of the fur peeking out from underneath.

a raven-painted, iron-studded roundshield~
A large, roundshield covered in iron studs lies here, a white raven painted across it.~
   Dark wooden planks have been bound together and cut to form 
this large, round shield. Over the surface of the wood a leather 
hide has been stretched, painted onto it a stark white raven over 
an older, faded image nearly unnoticeable beneath the fresh 
paint. All over the rounded wooden surface iron studs have been 
punched through the leather, a pair of leather straps on the back 
allowing a place to grasp this shield.

helm rotted ghoulish warg-head CRAPPY_UNIQUE_HELM_BOGDUSH LEATHER~
a rotted, ghoulish warg-head helm~
A rotted, ghoulish warg head lies here, fashioned into a crude helmet.~
   The thickness of this beastly animal head is absolutely 
massive. The humongous jaw has been dislocated and opened wide, 
pointed iron studs pounded into the side to hold it agape. The 
eyes gleam lifelessly, staring out in a beady, fiery gaze. The 
fur is hard, dyed a blood-red, bristle and gluey, a strong, 
putrid smell wafting from the hair, intense enough to burn 
nostrils. Where the snout once was, two large holes have been 
carved out, giving a broad view of the outside for the user. 
Inside the head, the flesh has been tendered flat, the skin a 
pale bleach, riveted with rusting studs, securing long strips of 
iron to offer more protection that the bone skull doesn't. 
Overall, this head is fierce, ghoulish and would appear to offer 
somewhat sufficient protection to the head of the wearer.

helm arena_unique GOOD-Quality orc-faced orc-head leather helmet black LEATHER~
an orc faced leather helm~
A leather helmet, shaped with orc's features~
   This helm is shaped as the head of a jet black skinned orc, 
and it has been tanned and fashioned from bone with skill so that 
someone could wear it over their head, concealing their features, 
as a leather helmet. The eyes have been cut out to allow for the 
wearer's vision. The faceplate is of iron, bone and leather, 
twisted and decorated into the deformed features of an angered 
orc. It has an extra flap at the back to cover the neck. The 
flap at the back, and the helms top are covered in long strands 
of grimy, twisted hair to give further resemblance to an orc, the 
hair itself appearing to original to the vile creature.

an altered shoulder patch bearing a crudely-painted skull~
An altered patch of leather lies here, a crude skull painted on one side.~
   Mottled brown, this patch of leather has a dirty-grey skull 
crudely painted on its surface. A worn thong of hide is threaded 
through, allowing it to be tied to an arm. In the corner of the 
patch, to one side of the skull, a blowfly has been sketched 
hastily and with little skill.

clear bottle ship intricately detailed GLASS WOOD~
a detailed miniature ship within a clear bottle~
A clear bottle sits here with an intricately made ship inside of it.~
   Made of clear glass this bottle has been carefully made, one 
side of it flat so the bottle won't roll. Attached within the 
bottle by small amounts of blue glass rests a small ship. When 
looking closely you can see the great care which was used to make 
this ship. Miniature oars, ropes and even a dingy complete this 
work of art. The mast stands high, sails billowing slighly as if 
they were catching the wind. One might wonder how the small ship 
fit inside of the bottle as he hole is smaller than the ship and 
sails together. A cork is stuck in the end, sealing the ship 
inside of the bottle.

shirt NUMENOREAN $finecolor silk tailored high collared TEXTILE~
a tailored, high-collared shirt of $finecolor silk~
A tailored shirt of $finecolor silk lies here.~
   Stitched from fine, $finecolor silk, this unembroidered shirt 
is of obviously high quality. The raised, circular collar has 
been tailored to closely encircle the throat, with its edges 
meeting almost seamlessly where small obsidian buttons trail up 
from mid-chest. Cut to fit the wearer's form, the sleeves are 
contoured to accommodate the swells and dips of bicep and 
forearm, while they widen slightly at the plain, unadorned cuff. 
From torso to waist, the shirt tapers inward slightly with the 
hem reaching to the middle of the hip of the wearer.

a small iron key~
A small iron key lies here.~
   Made of beaten iron, this small iron key has a short length. 
So short, in fact that the teeth which would appear otherwise 
normal seem overly long. It is undecorated, with a thick ring 
opposite the teeth to allow it to be twisted, as well as attached 
to a keyring.
