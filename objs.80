A twenty-yard bolt of fine, lustrous cotton lies here.~
   This cotton fabric is made of superior quality with a tight, 
even weave. The surface of the fabric is lustrous and sublimely 
soft, each fiber used in its making having been spun thin. Left 
its natural color, it's a very pale shade of ivory, enough to be 
mistaken for white when not compared side by side. The twenty 
yards of cloth have been rolled up for easy storage.

A pile of $color airy cotton pools on the floor.~
   Several layers of airy fabric comprise the swirling form of 
this delicate skirt. Sweeping wide about the wearer's legs, the 
$color cotton is also slightly sheer and would compromise one's 
modesty if not for the extra tiers that stagger along the hem in 
an artful fashion. Contrasting embroidery decorates along the 
hem in dainty scrolling detail, embellished here and there by 
beading that helps to add weight to the voluminous, gauzy folds 
as it whispers and floats about the wearer's ankles.

optimal flexibility. Upon the upper arm, dark, flaring steel 
protects the outer portion of the appendage, while the underside 
of the arm is lined with mail. A serpentine engraving snakes

the leg aptly, secured by dark leather straps over a backing of 
light mail. The crest of the lower plate, at the wearers knees 
flanges out, not hindering movement at the joint but still 
allowing protection at most angles. In between the segment 
protecting the thigh and the segment protecting the calf and 
shin, supple, midnight-hued leather is replaced, allowing 
unimpeded movement. Upon all the components, an elongated, 
snaking engraving has been carefully set, flanked by carefully 
etched crescent moons.

a gracefully curving silver key~
A gracefully curving silver key lies on the floor.~
   This is a clean, smoothly polished key, made from a silver 
metal. Its gracefully curved shape seems to have been an attempt 
to resemble the unfurling of a long veil or scarf, knotting at 
the top to form the loop for a keyring.

   The base of this fountain is wide and square, filling a good 
deal of the center of the souk under the provided shade. The 
edge is thick enough to allow for seating around the shallow 
basin, and the water within is cool and clean. Small, 
rectangular blue and green tiles line the bottom of the basin, 
even up to the angled square pedestal that rises from the water. 
From each side of the pedestal, water pours from several 
delicately arching streams out into the basin. More for 
decorative purposes, the water is still clean enough to drink 
from.

A blue water lily made of parchment is crumpled up here.~
   This likeness of a blue water lily is exquisitely made. Small 
snips of delicate parchment have been connected together to form 
the curling petals of this river flower, variations in the color

yellow in the center holds the entire creation together, a bit of 
green-painted string hanging down to fasten it to something.

A tangled mess of sweetly fragrant, blue water lilies blooms on the water.~
   Sending its sweetly fragrant aroma into the surrounding area, 
verdant pads and river water set the backdrop to the plethora of

A small bronze key lies here, etched with the image of an eye.~
   Cast of bronze, this small key is made in a relatively 
nondescript shape. A loop at the end creates a handle and a few 
basic tines cap the tip. The only detail of note is the small 
etching made near the handle, that of a single, wide eye.

   Simple in make, this key has been cast from bronze. A loop on 
the end serves as a handle and the tines stand straight, showing

as if to differentiate it from others. Curving lines swirl 
around the image of a triangle and a staring eye, set at 
different points upon the shaft.

A deep, simply elegant, white stone cistern is set slightly in the ground.~
   Looking as though it was build right where it stands, this 
cistern is deep enough to hold a fair amount of water and serves 
almost as a miniature well. Part of it is sunk into the ground, 
while the portion above ground is made of carefully smoothed, 
pure white stone bricks, mortared with equally white clay in 
between. The top-most edge has been decoratively carved with 
simple whirling vines, occasionally broken by a desert flower.

the branches, often food for birds before they can mature and

A keyring made of tempered steel and gold-leaf has been abandoned here.~
   This gargantuan ring of steel is clearly intended to hold 
keys, although only for one who would need to tote several dozens 
of them. A testament to the metalsmith who forged it, what seems 
to be a long, sturdy circlet of steel has been tempered to afford 
great durability and strength, and then decorated with 
applications of gold leaf to mark many segments. Attention to 
the way the gold has been set shows that the golden marks are 
intended as some sort of intricate record keeping, so the owner 
can quickly go through the keys to find a specific one.

A deadly-looking dagger has been rammed to the hilt in the bar's surface.~
   Jammed irrevocably into the scarred surface of the bar, the 
hilt of this dagger leans slightly to the side, suggesting a 
curved blade. Barely any of the blade's metal is visible, yet 
what can be seen is covered with darkened nicks and scratches 
from battles past. The wooden hilt of the dagger has been 
wrapped with layers of linen, each tattered color spattered with 
darkened stains akin to dried blood. A collection of lengthy 
strands of dark brown hair have been wound about the cross-guard, 
the ends crudely hacked off and bound with a black, linen tie.

A squat, stone-rimmed grate sits off to the side of the path.~
   Formed to the side of the main walking areas, a squat, stone 
rim marks the narrow opening in the ground that slips down deep

covers the mouth, attached by hinges to the brick which enables

smell rises from within it, along with a soft rushing sound of

a delicate, blue wine flute~
A delicate, watery blue wine flute lays here, etched with ripples.~
   This delicate wineglass is shaped tall and narrow, colored a 
faint watery blue shade with a fragile-looking stem that flares 
up into a fluted bowl. Not as large as it could have been, it is 
obviously meant to be used for drinks one would sip in smaller 
quantities. Near the rim of the glass, three rippling lines 
encircle it, a shade darker so as to stand out.

A rippled-etched, glass tankard lays here, tinted a watery blue.~
   Sturdy despite being made of glass, this tankard has a thick 
wall and a wide base. A water blue handle, colored like the rest 
of the glass, extends from the side and proves a comfortable grip 
for most hands. Not very large as tankards go, it can still hold 
a decent amount of liquid. Close to the brim, three lines of 
ripples have been etched, tinted a shade darker than the rest of 
the glass.

   Short and delicately formed, this watery blue glass looks 
close to a tiny water glass. The base is weighted, holding a few 
visible air bubbles, and the rim is a thin edge. Etched close to 
the brim, three fine lines of ripples have been made and tinted a 
shade darker than the rest of the glass.

A shallow porcelain bowl lays here, tinted watery blue.~
   This wide bowl is made of beautifully glazed porcelain, 
colored a watery blue. It is fairly shallow, the lip rising up 
and ending abruptly without any unnecessary ledge around it. 
Near the rim, both inside and out, three rippled lines stand out 
with a shade of darker blue. When empty, one would be able to 
see the delicate shape of a water lily at the inside bottom.

   This key is made of highly smoothed, ivory bone. Part of it 
appears to be crooked, except the angle is set in such a way to 
suggest a deliberation in its shaping. Careful, shallow etching 
has been formed over much of the surface, displaying a chaotic 
array of swirling waves or smoke.

a stable foundation. Near the rim, both inside and out, three 
rippled lines stand out with a shade of darker blue. When empty, 
the figure of a water lily on the inside bottom can be seen.

an ancient, weathered coin pendant~
A small, weathered coin lies here, attached to a bronze chain.~
   Slightly smaller than an inch in diameter, the edges of this 
coin are chipped in places, though it still maintains a 
distinctly round shape. Clearly ancient in origin, many of the 
ornate details upon this bronze coin have been weathered away 
with time. Upon one side of the coin is the profile of a face, a 
sharp nose and turban suggesting the figure is a male. The other 
side of the coin seems far more preserved, bearing the image of a 
caravan of camels resting within an oasis of palm trees. Words 
wrapping along the outside of the coin have been the victim of 
the chipped edges and are illegible. A hole has been bored into 
the top of the coin, through which a loop of bronze has been 
attached, a thin chain threaded through the hoop to turn it into 
a necklace.

   This exotic weapon is composed of an elaborate, cobra-shaped 
bronze hilt connected to a strong steel blade that widens as it 
nears its tip, where it curves upwards into a point. A groove on 
one side of the scimitar is designed to decrease the weapon's 
weight and make it more manageable in battle. The hilt is 
wrapped in a thin piece of black-dyed leather, doing nothing to 
detract from the detail of the cobra that wraps around the 
handle.

an intimate, hexagonal bath framed in $color~
A hexagonal bath is filled with steaming water, framed by $color tiles.~
   The inside of this bath is tiled with cobalt blue tiles, 
giving the hot water a dark blue color that obscures much 
underneath in dark reflections. Most of the small pool is sunk 
into the ground, leaving only a small, six-inch lip above, tiled 
in $color. With enough space to fit only three bodies 
comfortably, a narrow ledge curves three of the angled sides of 
the hexagon, forming both a step and a place to sit. However, 
the water is just shallow enough to immerse half a full-grown man 
if he is standing.

A large bathing pool fills much of the room, centered by a low fountain.~
   Filling much of the room, wispy tendrils of steam rise from 
the heated water within the pool. The cobalt blue tiles cast 
dark reflections on the bottom of the bath, the light bending and 
reflecting dimly, which offers some measure of modesty. While 
the edges of the pool are flush with the ground, a step trails 
around the entirety of the bath, offering a place to sit 
underneath the water's surface, which offers the chance to 
submerse oneself up to the neck in warm, relaxing water. In the 
center of the pool, a lily-shaped fountain rises from a lily pad, 
bubbling with clean, renewed hot water.

a rusty-looking iron key~
An iron key has been left here, having a ruddy rust color.~
   This key has an aged appearance at first glance, the metal 
being a ruddy color and its surface bearing an uneven surface. 
However, upon closer inspection, what seems to be rust and decay 
is actually the combined result of tinting and texturing, the 
other of signs of rusting being devoid. Whether this is by 
design or accident, it is unclear.

creating the slight detail of feathered wings, the tips of which 
have been tinted a pale violet. The figurine is perched on an 
ecru tinted glass branch that has been fashioned to stand 
sturdily on its own, but with a realistic touch. A delicately 
detailed, three-petal flower, tinted violet with a minute, yellow 
stamen sits curved on a little stem that is clasped in the 
songbird's little beak.

   Hanging for a fine silver chain, this hawk talisman has spread 
its wings wide, head slightly turned to the side. It is more a 
silhouette of the creature, free from any excessive detailing or 
scrollwork aside from its feathers and the outline of its beak. 
A single small moonstone represents the creature's eye and 
glistens with ease catching and reflecting any light near it. 
Small sigils have been engraved artistically onto the back of the 
talisman, requiring further inspection to discern their content.

   Designed to fit snugly about the upper arm in the style of a 
broad cuff, this solid piece is beautifully and intricately 
engraved with a flowing design. Depicting turbulent waves in a 
vast ocean, as well as painstakingly detailed little ships within 
the turmoil, the gleaming silver from which it is crafted draws 
and reflects light from it's surroundings, adding depth and 
catching the eye. A well concealed hinge mirrors a sturdy clasp 
which secures the band to it's wearer in a vaguely dominant 
manner, suggesting it to be a gift of possession as well as 
adoration.

A viciously barbed shield of blackened steel is set carefully here~
   Menacing in it's sheer size and design alone, this immense 
shield is clearly crafted by a Master of the trade. Sleek, dully 
gleaming blackened steel is expertly formed into the typical 
pointed 'V', aside from the upper left corner. This has been 
unusually cut away in a rounded crescent, both to lessen the 
weight and allow further opportunity to inflict grievous damage 
upon an opponent. The only indulgent touch, unless one counts 
the vicious barbs that accentuate the shield's surface, is an 
empty socket within the shield's centre. The the artwork clearly 
tribal in nature. All told, the piece would easily protect it's 
bearer from shoulder to thigh, a pair of thick ebony leather 
straps allowing for a secure hold within the slight curvature of 
it's spine.

the writing on it is neatly scripted however and, as can read by 
any city official, explains how this document is necessary to 
make a work request in the construction office in Fahad'Jafari. 
It also goes to caution that approval of plans be obtained before 
making the official work request as the permit will not be 
reimbursed if the manager will proceed with the request.

that part open to the thighs, revealing what lies beneath.

a diaphanous, $finecolor silk veil~
A delicate rectangle of $finecolor chiffon has been left here.~
   The very nature of the chiffon silk used to make this 
delicate, $finecolor veil renders it translucent, obscuring the 
wearer's features only partially. A vaguely rectangular shape, 
it is made to be worn over or about the face, its shape allowing 
various styles of display. It is simply fashioned with nearly 
invisible stitches along the hem and a trim of modest scrolling 
embroidery, easily missed upon first glance.

A fine pair of sirwall pants lies here, made of $finecolor silk.~
   Loose-fitting and comfortable, these pants begin to taper 
slightly as they near the ankle. Cut to accentuate the muscles 
of the calves, they can be worn with any style of footwear with 
dashing effect. Fashioned of light-weight $finecolor silk, they 
are obviously meant to be paired with a longer shirt over it, 
fastening simply and neatly at the waist with plain bronze 
buttons.

A richly soft, $finecolor silk gomlek lies here.~
   This $finecolor shirt is made from light-weight silk, making 
it richly soft and comfortable to wear. The neckline encircles 
the wearer's neck closely and splits down the chest. Elaborate 
scrolling embroidery in complimenting colored thread follows the 
seams of the neckline, ending on the chest in an angular point. 
The loose sleeves fall to the wrists, adorned with similar 
embroidery. Likewise, the lower hemline bears needlework as it 
falls just past the mid-thigh.

   With a high, stiff collar of gold-trimmed damask ribbon and an 
ankle-length hem, this kamis would appear to attempt modesty if 
not for the gossamer thin fabric that comprises this garment. 
The pale, nearly white silken chiffon clings to the skin in full, 
airy folds, soft and draping over every curve, giving just a hint 
of what lies under it. The sleeves are loose with a slight 
gather at the shoulders for definition, ending at the wrists in 
stiff cuffs trimmed with the same ribbon as that at the neck.

It is large enough to fully wrap around a normal man, the thick, 
bushy mane wrapping around the neck of the wearer. The inside of 
the cloak has been lined with supple, fine linen, sewn with tiny 
stitches to not disturb the beauty of the golden fur. Along the 
coarse inside of the cloak, a soft band of silk have been sewn to 
protect the wearer's neck from chafing. Silver clasps have been 
sewn to both sides of the cloak, clasping it together with thick, 
looped silver thread.

Luxurious silk linens and bedspreads cover the mattress, accented 
by matching, decorative pillows of differing shapes, sizes, and

head from a center point overhead, able to be drawn around the 
whole of the bed.

lion. The edges have been trimmed carefully and the pelt is

opened in an eternal snarl. A long, dark-brown mane frames the 
vicious head of the dead beast but where it ends golden-brown, 
thick fur takes over to cover the entire rug all the way out to 
the paws. The tip of the long tail, however, still has long tuft 
of dark-brown fur.

snuggly around the calf and ankle, the inside lined with finest 
silk to make sure they provide comfort and luxury.

from the semblance of a bushy mane to the definitively large 
front paws as the animal remains in its perpetual crouching

A silken pair of low, $finecolor salwar is folded neatly here.~
   Worn perilously low at the hips of the wearer, these 
salwar-style pants are decorated by a gauzy sash stitched to the 
waistband. Small, musical bells have been fixed to the sash, 
which ties at the side and jingles against the thigh. The pants 
are made of $finecolor medium weight silk, soft and smooth 
against the skin, making it a pleasure to wear. With slash-style 
seams down the sides, the loose, billowing legs reveal teasing 
shows of flesh underneath at six-inch intervals down to the 
narrowly cuffed ankle. And while these look best with slippers 
or sandals, the slits have been designed in such a way that the 
salwar remains flattering even when tucked into boots.

strap hugs the back, keeping the entire top together with a

   Made of lustrous, medium weight silk, this $finecolor choli 
follows the shape of the body closely, its lower hem ending just 
a little under the bust. The pear-shaped neckline scoops low on 
the chest, but without revealing too much before the straps curve 
in towards the neck and opens wide along the back, leaving only 
what is necessary to keep the garment on securely. Small cap 
sleeves bear a decorative accent of three draping strands of 
beads and tiny, musical bells that jingle against the wearer's 
skin. Similar belled strands create a scalloped border along the 
bottom most hem, brushing against the bared midriff.

larger leaf, its stem curled to form a hole or a keyring. The 
creamy white of the ivory has been stained with verdant green 
only at the top.

A gleaming, uncoiled whip made of steel lies here.~
   From the bronze hilt, to the gleaming steel strands, this 
urumi is made with near perfect craftsmanship. Several flexible, 
steel strands protrude from the bronzed hilt, close-knit near the 
base, and coming apart from each other at the other end. The 
steel gleams in the light, and despite it's beauty, is made for 
one thing only, to flay its victims. In the hands of a masterful 
user, this weapon could be instantly deadly, the steel whip able 
to slice through nearly any metal, or wrap about a limb or 
object. All in all, this urumi is nearly seven feet long, from 
hilt to tip, the gleaming steel whips nearly six and a half by 
themselves.

an ash recurved shortbow with intricate ivory inlay~
an recurved shortbow made of ash and inlaid intricately with ivory has been left here.~
   This masterfully crafted ash shortbow is inlaid with ivory. 
The grip has been covered with supple leather, designed to be the 
body of a lion, its ivory-maned head serving as the the arrow 
rest. Oddly, the lion appears to have numerous tails, undulating 
in intricate curls and spirals as it spreads outward to the limbs 
of the bow. The bowstring is finely strung sinew, giving off no 
sound whatsoever whenever an arrow is released.

   What this piece lacks in subtlety, it more than makes up for 
in the quality of it's craftsmanship alone. Surely weighty, what 
was once a band of richly gleaming gold is now scattered and 
raised with the multitude of tiny, glittering jewel chips that 
adorn it. Ranging from seductive ruby to fathomless jet, 
swooning emerald to serene lapis, it seems every hue of the 
rainbow has been ensnared upon upon this single small item of 
jewelry, leaving it both dazzling and confusing to the beholder's 
eye. At it's peak, the ring's ostentatious decoration rises a 
good half inch from the finger of it's bearer, it's facets 
dizzying as they dance with the light. The massive emerald, 
excessively sized and precisely cut to a beryl crowns this fine 
piece.

A knot shaped pendant made of polished silver fashioned with an aquamarine gem attached to a fine black silk cord is here.~
   A fine black cord is set through a hole on the back of this 
silver pendant so that it will fall just below the neckline of 
the wearer. The pendant itself is small, no more than two inches 
at most. It is shaped like a knot tied around an aquamarine gem 
with the ends of the ends of the silver-cast string falling down 
below the gem. The aquamarine gem is fairly small but not tiny. 
The size and color of the gem contrast well with its unique 
silver setting. A round cut causes the gem to cast colors in all 
directions when held to the light.

a roaring-lion full-helm of lustrous bronze and steel~
A roaring-lion full-helm of lustrous bronze and steel sits here on the ground.~
   This lustrous full-helmet looks to be me made of a high grade 
of steel predominantly. It has been pounded and shaped into the 
likeness of a roaring lion, intricate detail showing face, jaw, 
and teeth. Instead of where the eyes would be, holes have been 
chiseled out to give the wearer a means of seeing. The flamish 
mane of the lion head helm has been cast from bronze in a bent, 
flowing and bumpy pattern to give the impression of the great 
mane of a male lion. Riveted onto the top, it completes the 
image of the roaring lion. The inside of the helm has been 
padded with leather panels and again further with cotton to 
provide better comfort for the wearer.

A leather khabata capped with bronze lies here.~
   This weapon is constructed mainly of a semi-flexible, 
cylindrical leather rod, about a foot in length. Whilst the 
leather is hard to the touch and solid in structure it gives just 
enough bend to provide more force when swung. The end of the 
inch-and-a-half thick rod has been capped in bronze, the thick 
gleaming metal riveted strongly to the leather. An elaborate 
knot design has been worked into the bronze, and neither a 
beginning nor an end to the engraved knot-work can be found. A 
leather loop has been attached to the leather handle, so one 
might be able to hang this weapon from a belt.

does not allow for any flexibility in its swing the khabata looks 
to still be able to do some damage. A leather thong decorated 
with large, cat-like claws has been attached to the handle.

length, one side sharpened to a razor-keen edge. The blade 
curves with this sharpened edge on the inside of the bend, so one 
would have to grip the ivory handle in an overhand manner to use 
the knife effectively. The hilt is just large enough to wrap one 
hand around and has been engraved with a scarab, darkened with 
red dye, on either side. A bronze pommel, shaped like a large 
cat-like claw, has been attached to the hilt to balance the 
weapon.

has been wrapped in supple, tanned leather, allowing the user a

the edge is kept on the inside of the bend, so one would have to

shape of the blade suggests it could be swung very quickly and 
accurately.

   In the shape of a miniature scythe this light, stabbing weapon 
is made up of a mahogany handle and a curving iron blade that has 
been sharpened to a fine tip. The handle has been wrapped in 
red-dyed leather to provide more grip, tassels falling from this. 
The tassels have been decorated with large, cat-like claws and 
sharp predatory teeth. The blade has been barbed where it meets 
the handle and one gets the impression that a blade could be 
trapped by this in a parry. A pommel fashioned from bronze into 
a sphere adorns the end of the handle.

   Resembling a mini-scythe this light weapon consists of a dark 
hardwood handle and a curving steel blade sharpened to a vicious 
tip, connected at right angles by sturdy bronze rivets. The 
blade has been barbed continuously upon its inside edge, likely 
to create a more brutal wound. The handle has been fashioned of 
polished white ivory, small bronze studs circling its top and 
bottom. Leather tassels fall from a knot-engraved bronze pommel, 
died red and bearing onyx beads. The join of blade to handle 
seems to have been crafted with the trapping of an attacker's 
blade in mind.

   Three steel blades protrude from each of these katar's, 
leading down into strong, bronze handles. Each handle has a 
bronze cross-bar imbedded into them, the outer pieces continuing 
on to end near the wrist, allowing better defense and protection 
of the hand. The outer blades of the katar's are angled away 
from the straightened middle blade, but all are honed to a 
razor-sharp point. These well-balanced katar's are as effective 
as they are beautiful, the craftsmanship unmatched. Etched into 
the bronze handles and leading up into the steel blades are 
intricate tribal designs.

the fashion typical to this manner of weapon. This polished 
steel blade, the inside edge sharpened to a keen edge, has a 
shallow groove hollowed along its slightly curving length, likely 
to lighten the weapon. The blade joins to a silver-trimmed 
bronze hilt without a hand-guard though the pommel curves back up 
toward the blade in the shape of a cat-like claw. This weapon 
seems to have been crafted by a skilled metalworker, intricate 
knot designs worked in silver upon the darkened bronze hilt.

   Crafted like a typical yatagan the slender blade of this 
weapon curves toward a sharp point, roughly three feet in length. 
The inside edge of this gradual curve has been sharpened with 
function in mind, as the whole weapon seems to have been. The 
blade bears a shallow groove along its length, and the bone hilt 
has been wrapped in dark leather to improve the grip. It would 
seem that this weapon is meant for use in a single hand though 
one might be able to fit a hand and a half on the sturdy hilt. A 
pommel in the shape of diamond has been fastened to the hilt to 
act as a counterweight.

looks to be nearly two foot in length. The top of this 
kassara'azma has been rounded off, a large stud of bronze 
crowning the smooth craftsmanship. Following down from this stud 
many more bronze rivets spiral down and around the circumference 
of this club-like weapon until they reach a six-inch area near 
the bottom of the kassara'azma, where leather has been wrapped 
neatly to form a sturdy grip. The weapon looks heavy, but not 
heavy enough to warrant the use of two hands.

A twin-bladed rumha lies here, its steel blades gleaming.~
   This weapon has been constructed of burnished steel wrought 
into a heavy five-foot shaft and wrapped in sand-hued leather. 
From tip to base of this pole leather tassels have been left to 
dangle loosely, some died scarlet red, all of them sporting an 
assortment of animal parts; from large cat-like claws to 
viciously serrated teeth. The head of the shaft bears a pair of 
crescent-moon-shaped blades which meet at a wickedly sharp point, 
the leather-wrapped shaft stopping in the centre of the space 
created by the curving blades. Whilst the blades themselves are 
sharpened to a fine edge one gets the impression that this weapon 
would best be used in a spear-like manner. A lion's claw has 
been etched in bronze onto one of the blades.

A jewel-encrusted, steel-bladed pata is lying here.~
   The steel blade of this pata is barely three feet in length, 
but what it lacks in length, it makes up with precision and 
sharpness. Both edges of the blade are sharpened to a keen edge, 
tapering into an extremely acute tip. The blade is slightly 
thicker at the bottom, which leads into a full metal gauntlet, 
lined with padded leather. The gauntlet engulfs the entire hand 
and wrist, allowing better defense, and solid thrusting power. 
The gauntlet itself is conical in shape, and is encrusted with a 
jeweled scorpion on one side, and a jeweled serpent on the other.

a serrated, single-edged khanda~
A single-edged khanda with a serrated blade is lying here.~
   From the hilt of bronze, to the singled-edged blade of steel, 
this khanda is masterfully designed for killing. The unpolished 
blade is nearly four feet in length, the killing edge sharpened 
into a hundred dagger-like points. The top of the blade is 
squared, and the back-end is unsharpened, mainly used for 
defensive. The hilt of the blade is also unpolished, and is made 
of thick bronze, the handle wrapped with supple black leather to 
provide better grip. This khanda is made for one thing and one 
thing only, to rip open its victims.

   Made of gauzy, translucent cotton, this skirt falls in ample 
folds down to the wearer's ankles. An extra layer of cotton

thigh and leg. Each loose panel have been hemmed with a 
lettuce-edging effect, and all along the bottom hem, delicate 
clusters of golden bronze bells which tinkle against each other 
to a melodious result.

a lustrous, etched scimitar of steel~
A lustrous, etched scimitar of steel is here.~
   The hilt of this elegant scimitar, is shorter than normal, and 
made of hard oak. The oak is wrapped in the finest leather, and 
offers the user a very strong grip on the blade. A gleaming, 
silver pommel is affixed to the hilt, perfectly balancing the 
blade and offering superior protection to the hand of the user. 
Along part of the pommel, and extending up the blade, is a 
perfectly etched lioness, crouched low to the ground, it's body 
stretched and sleek. Even moreso up the lustrous blade, on the 
other side, are more engravings. Two, perfectly etched lion cubs 
stand at the feet of another sleek, elegant lioness, pawing at 
each other playfully. The craftsmanship of this blade is nearly 
unmatched, and although elegant, the blade is sharpened to a 
razor keen edge, and could be extremely deadly in the hands of an 
experienced user.

cuirass exquisite bronze steel plate pXash cJaarid qLaecla METAL~
an exquisite bronze and steel plate cuirass~
Gleaming here on the ground is an exquisite bronze and steel plate cuirass.~
   This cuirass is composed of two large bronze plates, one in 
front and one in the back. The front plate has been pounded into 
a shape depicting the musculature of a lion's chest. Further 
etching on the plate has given it a slightly wavy and imperfect 
surface, resulting in the impression of it being furry like a 
lion as well. Steel bands wrap around the sides to smaller 
plates under the arms and then further on around to the back 
plate. These smaller plates have raised grooves on them in the 
shape of a creature's ribs. This bronze plate is also unique in 
design as it has been pounded and shaped to resemble the muscles 
and, in the center, a ridge representing the backbone of a 
creature. A bumpy raised and lowered pattern at the top with 
lines etched in indicates the bottom of a lion's mane. 
Functionally, the raised part of this plate allows for the wearer 
to have full movement while wearing a large sized helm on their 
head. The whole piece is riveted together in such a way to allow 
some movement, or lee-way in the piece so as to give the wearer 
incredible coverage while not overly restricting movement. A set 
of buckles around the left underarm allow it to be taken on and 
off with relative ease and further buckles around the shoulders 
would indicate the ability to attach sleeves or pauldrons. In 
essence, this armor is as much a piece of art as a tool of war 
and is clearly the work of a master.

a gold-pinstriped, sleeveless shirt of pitch black silk~
A gold-pinstriped, sleeveless shirt made of pitch black silk lies here.~
   Tailored to fit a masculine figure closely, this shirt has 
been made of medium-weight silk. The hem along the shoulders 
ends without sleeves at a complimenting width, leading to a short 
standing collar and deep v-neckline. Obsidian buttons have been 
affixed to black silk cords, knotted and corresponding to 
buttonholes along the chest. Fine gold-threaded pinstripes have 
been carefully worked along the length of the tunic, ending at a 
gold hemline that ends a few inches short of the knees. Even 
with complimenting side-vents along the side, this shirt would 
tuck into a pair of pants rather smartly.

a tailored, pitch black coat with golden embroidery~
A tailored, pitch black coat with golden embroidery lies here.~
   Tailored and trim-fitting, this coat has been dyed an utterly 
pitch black in color. Heavy silk proves a sturdy medium for its 
stand-up collar of several inches and off-centered overlap, where 
the coat closes by way of buttons hidden beneath. As the coat 
falls to the wearer's knees, it gradually falls open from 
hip-height as though coaxed by gravity. Black and gold threads 
weave together to create an understated, embroidered design along 
the collar and overlapping side, depicting a vague, fiery motif. 
A similar design follows the cuffs of the coat, but only in 
black, causing the embroidery to be easily overlooked.

   A simple rectangle of lightweight silk forms the shape of this 
litham. Covering from ear to ear and secured by black silk 
cords, it shields the lower half of the wearer's face, bridge of 
the nose to well below the chin. It has been dyed pitch black 
and bears elaborate embroidery depicting fiery tongues of fire 
consuming the lower half. Threads of red, yellow, and orange 
intermingle to catch the full spectrum of flames, intermingled 
with gold strands which catch the light at the right angles.

A platinum ring with exquisite blue diamonds inlaid into it is here.~
   A gleaming, platinum wedding band is masterfully forged, and 
etched with fine designs of long, wavy-stemmed roses with thorns 
attached. Atop this ring, in the center, the main jewel is a 
large, exquisite blue diamond, glistening out in every direction 
when hit by a strong light source. All about the large stone, 
are tiny little white ones, but of exquisite quality just the 
same. The smaller diamonds form to make a pattern, starting 
thick near the base stone, and thinning out into a single point, 
ultimately making a filled in V shape. The quality and 
craftsmanship of this ring is unmatched, obviously done with care 
and desire.

A dusky, serrated scimitar with an ivory hilt is here.~
   The steel of this blade is of the finest quality, and has been 
stained by smoke purposely. The curve of the blade is little 
less than the shape of a crescent moon, but unlike most blades of 
this kind, the edge has been formed into fairly large sawlike 
teeth, and has been honed to the finest edge possible. The smoky 
steel blade is affixed firmly to a hilt of the strongest ivory, 
and has been wrapped in fine silk of the same color. The pommel 
is made of the same steel as the blade, and curves down to 
provide superior protection for the hand of the user. All in 
all, the craftsmanship of this blade is exceptional, and the 
blade itself looks to be extremely capable even in the hands of a 
novice.

A single-bladed war-axe is here, with a leather-wrapped haft.~
   A viciously sharp, single crescent blade sits as the head of 
this axe. Obviously crafted for the ability to rend flesh rather 
than wood, the blade offers a broad cutting edge with a low 
ridging of serration along the bottom most edge that ceases after 
a few inches. The haft is crafted from a seasoned heart-wood, 
with grooves carved out for firm placement of the fingers. 
Spiralling up the haft is a knotted cord provided to cease grip 
from slipping during it's usage. Near the bottom of the haft, is 
a slightly curved spike of unpolished bronze, balancing out the 
weight of the axe as well as providing an alternate means of 
dealing a death blow.

seemingly random fashion to break up the form of the one draped

seem to need regular care to not flake away or fall into

these gloves provide good protection from the elements of the 
plains and desert, but need to be provided for, lest they dry up

small protrusions at the heel and toes hardly noticable.

a finely tailored overcoat of $finecolor silk~
A finely tailored $finecolor coat lays here, the silk neatly pressed.~
   This overcoat has been meticulously fashioned for a tailored 
fit, fitting the wearer's form closely with straight, trim seams. 
The silk used is of a heavyweight grade, given a wash of 
$finecolor dye. From a thick stand-up collar, two rows of black, 
obsidian buttons run along the length of the chest, able to be 
left widely unbuttoned and folded open or fastened snug for a 
more formal look. The sleeves end in roomy, wide cuffs, which 
fold over to reveal a complimenting black trim. The garment 
falls past the waist in stately folds to the calves, a hidden 
pleat at the back allows a dramatic sweep when walking.

craftsmanship of this simple iron crown is incredible. Forged 
from silver, darkening agents have been worked into the wide, 
flat band to give it a smoky appearance, doubly emphasized by 
considerable age. Archaic runes have been carefully etched into 
the metal, serving as the headbands only embellishment.

An aged, rune-etched iron warsword is set here.~
   Forged of dark iron, this ancient war-sword stands at nearly 
five feet in total length. Its keen edge shows signs of having 
been attentively resharpened a multitude of times through the 
centuries, yet it still remains wickedly edged, utterly lacking 
in nicks or other flaws. The sword is utilitarian in design, 
from the leather-wrapped hilt and straight roped crossguard to 
the blade itself, it lacks any sort of decoration save one along 
the blades flat a series of runes have been etched into the dark 
metal, their archaic designs standing out brightly in some form 
of strange green ink.

An archaic, battered iron helm is set carefully aside.~
   Still showing several smaller scars and dents not yet fully 
hammered out from some previous encounter, this archaic helmet 
has clearly seen a lifetime of use. Despite the wear, it remains 
fully functional, the aged iron frame well oiled and maintained. 
That frame is forged in a simple barbute design, conical and 
slightly ridged at the top to help shed blows, its protective 
material encircling the head and face save for a T shaped gap at 
the front. Above the face-gap runs a horizontal ridge, almost as 
though some thin band or decoration were missing, lost to the 
ravages of time.

A battered iron bevor is set here.~
   Aged and oiled iron come together to form a darkly colored 
piece of protective armor. Forged by the attentive hand of a 
master, this bevor guards the neck, throat and upper chest of the 
one who wears it, hooks neatly linking it together with other 
pieces of the suit. Its dark surface is scratched in numerous 
places, signs of both age and hard use through that age, yet at 
other times the scratches seem almost as intended decoration. 
One such scratch positioned below the throat is clearly an 
etching, though its unusual runic form makes it difficult to 
immediately pick out from the rest.

   Borne of three overlapping lobster-like sections riveted to 
one another for ease of movement, this iron cuirass maintains its 
state despite the numerous dents that tell tale of countless 
battles and past repairs. A parted layer of overlapping flaps 
hangs down over the thighs to help blend flawlessly into 
leggings, while similar layered pauldrons hang from the 
shoulders. The main front plate is heavily adorned with etched 
artistic flourishes and scrollwork, though close inspection 
reveals a number of archaic runes among the decoration.

left with little of their former glory. Scratches and age have 
shed much of the artistic scrollwork that covered their plated 
sides, while sword strokes have added newer engravings of their 
own. Still, the dark iron metal remains oiled and well cared 
for, the articulated joint still providing a full range of 
motion, the scratched plates a fine ward against blows.

   Form and function blend seamlessly together to have formed a 
beautiful, if old, pair of war gauntlets. Formed of articulated 
plates to provide a free range of motion, these gauntlets provide 
excellent protection against blows of all sorts, yet it is the 
runic scrollwork marking them, and the claws that make them stand 
out. Simple and brutally effective, a pair of wickedly curved 
talons rise a short way from the knuckles, providing a remarkably 
effective deterrent to ones desire to grapple with the wearer.

holster criss crossed dual bow pKorisanth qLaecla LEATHER~
a criss-crossed dual bow-holster with side bags~
A criss-crossed, dual bow-holster with side pouches lies here.~
   This exquisitely made bow holster is uniquely made to hold a 
longbow and a shortbow in independent sleeves that crisscross in 
the middle. The sleeves are finely stitched together such that 
the mouths of each sleeve are level, each sporting its own cap 
attached to the sleeve by a thin cord of leather. The longbow 
sleeve is dyed a deep-indigo color whereas the shortbow holster 
is colored a wine-red. Each sleeve is decorated with deep green 
ivy designs, a color matched both caps. Sewn to the back of the 
sleeves away from the wearer is a large quiver with two 
compartments. The outside of this quiver a mix of deep-indigo 
and wine-red, split down the middle matching the upper parts of 
the sleeves. The quiver also sports fine black ivy designs. 
This holster has a thick supple leather strap, long enough to be 
worn over the shoulder or even across the back. Straps are 
attached to the holsters so that they can be secured closer 
together for shoulder wear. Because the holster is made of fine 
supple leather it is lighter than one might expect.

   Well made, hardened leather, dyed $finecolor has been shaped

creating patterns of tribal design all over the hauberk. 
Imbedded firmly into the leather are unpolished, bronze studs of

A talwar sword is here, the pommel spiked and the edge keen.~
   From the acute point of the arced blade, down to the sharpened 
spike on the end of it's pommel, is iron of the finest quality. 
The iron is colored a smoky grey, and is completely unpolished, 
capturing nearly all light that comes in touch with it. The 
blade itself is sharpened to an extremely fine edge, dulling up 
just slightly before it comes to secure itself into the disc 
shaped hilt. A curved knucklebow extends down from the 
crossguard, and is made of the same quality and color iron as the 
rest of the sword. The short, sharpened spike on the end of the 
pommel is pierced, and a leather cord has been laced through to 
tie to the users wrist.

rope-like band. Simplistic in design, yet crafted with the 
utmost care, the curve of the ring is smooth, its unbroken form a 
perfect circle. A single diamond has been set into the face of 
the ring, held in place by a delicately crafted setting, ensuring 
the safety of the precious stone. A masterful cut brings out the 
inner brilliance of the stone with numerous needle-like facets, 
catching and refracting any light that hits it and causing the 
stone to shine and glimmer. Two medium sized pearls have been 
set around the clear diamond.

by clusters of tiny, silver beaded jasmine blossoms, have been

   This key has an aged appearance at first glance, the metal

However, upon closer inspection, what seems to be rust and decay

other of signs of rusting being devoid. Whether this is by 
design or accident, it is unclear.

silken mattress inside for a sleeping babe, the entire piece is 
crowned by a spiraling arch of ivory from which an airy 
$finecolor canopy drapes, spilling over the cradle.

types of swords. A striking cobra is embroidered on the front.

   This helm is of a conical shape, tapering from the protective 
panels enclosing the head towards a stylized bronze tip which has 
been fashioned into the shape of a striking cobra's head. The 
rest of the helm appears to be made of burnished steel, though 
most of this is covered in sand-hued linen, wrapping in loose 
folds from top to bottom, a hook-and-eye piece connecting the 
fabric across the face of the helm. Across this face-piece a 
cobra's head has been dyed in black, the fangs bared.

a wide platinum band with jade and pearl inlay~
A wide band made of platinum is here, a pearl and jade inlay seen easily with the light.~
   Centered around this gleaming wide platinum band, is a dark 
jade inlay, smooth to the touch, and about one quarter of the 
width of the band. The jade itself is of a singular, dark shade, 
and speaks of it's excellent quality. On either side of the 
jade, a thinner band of white pearl inlay can be seen, a small 
band of the platinum base showing inbetween the two different 
stones. The jade shines in a subdued fashion, due to the dark 
coloring of it, whereas the creamy-white pearls gleam with just a 
hint of light touching their base. The inlay of the pearl 
sections seem to have been made of hundreds of different pearl 
shavings, affixed together perfectly and smoothed to a proper 
sheen. Overall this piece speaks of care and precision, and its 
masterful quality is easy to see. Elegant, yet simple in design, 
the size and weight of this ring hint that it is to be worn by a 
man.

bulbous end has been set with a tiny fire-opal, the color 
splaying across its surface a brilliant contrast to the lustre of 
the pendant. All of this detail and care has been worked into 
the small, two-inch length of the pendant. A delicate gold chain 
has been linked to the feather through the end of its stem.

A gold sword pendant lies here, attached to a delicate chain."~
   This gold pendant has been expertly crafted into the shape of 
a curving sword, looking very similar to a scimitar, the blade 
broadening as it curves away from the hilt. The blade of the 
sword has been worked with such skill that even the fuller 
running from the hilt to the tip of the blade can be seen, as can 
the detail of wrapping about the handle, complete with a tiny 
fire-opal pommel. Though these features are easily identifiable 
due to the skill of the detail in this piece, the pendant is no 
larger than two inches in length. A fine, delicate gold chain 
runs through the twirling crossguard of the pendant, attaching to 
itself with a simple clasp.

fletchings etched to look like feathers. The head has been 
crafted from a small fire-opal, the color splaying across its 
surface a brilliant contrast to the lustre of the gold. The

holds easily with a simple clasp.

with a rich, silvery brocade. It is entirely made up of an 
extremely long rectangle of silk that wraps several times in 
delicate pleats around its wearer's waist and falls into a full, 
floor-length skirt. The loose end can be swept across the front 
of the torso from the waist and draped either over one shoulder 
or over the head or face, and bears an elaborate brocade design 
that reaches from its edge and gradually tapers off into smaller 
silver embellishments that cover the remainder of the garment. 
It can be worn with or without a choli, the wearer's back, side, 
and shoulder exposed where the wrap's free end does not cover.

A steel-bladed pata lies here, its hilt trimmed with gold.~
   This weapon is made of high-quality steel, the flat, 
double-edged blade tapering to a vicious point, water-like 
ripples flowing down the steel. Through the centre of this blade 
runs a shallow fuller, reducing the overall weight of the weapon, 
though it does not run to the tip of the pata. The hilt has been 
constructed so that it covers the whole hand, adding protection 
such as a gauntlet might as it wraps over the fingers, right to 
the beginning of the wielder's wrist. The highly-polished guard 
has been etched in gold, with apparent finesse, to depict a lion 
rearing up on its hind feet, clawing with its front limbs. The 
top and bottom of the hilt have also been trimmed in gold, the 
top trimming extending an inch along the blade's fuller in a 
swirling pattern. Though the blade is sharp on both sides the 
weight of the weapon and its needle-like point suggest it is a 
stabbing weapon.
