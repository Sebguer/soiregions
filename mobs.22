Eradan BATTALION battalion grim-countenanced black-haired man~
a grim-countenanced, black-haired man~
A black-haired man with a grim countenance stands here warily.~
   Grey-flecked black hair frames the dark visage of this 
middle-aged man, closey-cropped atop his head, and roughly shaven 
about his jaw and lips. His complexion is fair, but riddled with 
marks of war, a red scar adorning the right of his face from ear 
to chin. His cloudy grey eyes lie beneath the hard ridge of his 
brow, shadowed in their sockets, adding to the gravity of his 
features. His build is one of lean muscle; his height, 
impressive.

Lent WestFold broad shouldered square chinned man BATT_PAYMASTER~
a broad, square-chinned man~
A broad-shouldered man with a square chin stands here.~
   Broad of shoulder and stout of frame, this man holds himself 
to a ridged posture. His dark brown hair is kept short, neat, 
and relatively clean. His face is kept neatly shaven, his 
prominent chin giving way to a heavily muscled neck. He has a 
long scar running across his face, crossing his left eye, the 
pupil white. His remaining eye, a light green hue, seems to be 
permanently squinting. A long roping scar mars his left arm, and 
he is missing half of his index finger on the same arm. His 
other arm isn't better off, a large chunk of the flesh missing 
from the forearm. Despite his apparent injures, he holds himself 
upright, a determined look upon his face.

A grey, long-whiskered cat with white paws is here.~
   Long, fluffy fur hangs down from this female cat's lean body, 
making her appear larger than she actually is. Her undercoat is 
colored a dark grey while a lighter shade stripes color here and 
there along her body. A path of white wends its way from her 
face down the length of her stomach and also covers her paws. 
Her large eyes are a light blue circled by a band of gold and 
just beneath them is a small, pinkish nose framed by long, white 
whiskers.

the rotting corpse of a dark-blond-haired, green-eyed man~
a dark-blond, green-eyed man, his form rotting away, is here.~
   Standing tall and proud once more, this abomination was once a 
man but has succumbed to the weight of time. Dull green eyes 
peer out from a rotted face, where holes in the pale white skin 
allow the maggots to squirm in and out. A few whisps of moldy 
blond hair still cling to the creature's scalp, draping down to 
it's shoulders. There is a hollow look to it's features, it's 
mouth usually open and it's jaw hanging.

the rotting corpse of a salt-and-pepper haired, blue eyed man~
The rotting corpse of a tall, salt-and-pepper haired man stands here.~
The pungent smell of death clings to this figure, once a man 
of great height. His face is the color of a chalky white, and a 
long gash runs deeply from his forehead down to the base of his 
neck. Unkept, dry hair barely seems to be able to stay on his 
head, the majority long since gone white though a few short black 
strands are scattered throughout. Bright blue eyes observe the 
world, a certain hollowness very much detectable.

The decomposing form of a stalwart, dark-haired man lingers near.~
   This abomination, once a male human, has slowly succumbed to 
the passing of time. His entire body is covered in maggots, 
dirt, and grime, and what's left of his skin has turned a deathly 
white. Strong sinew can be seen underneath his skin, and black 
moldy hair hangs from his scalp. Light green eyes look out at 
the world, hollow and dull.

   Of fair skin and grey eyes, this young man features have the 
nobility of an heritage of old. Of elegant posture, he is rather 
spry, lacking any bulging muscles. His hands seems agile and 
free of any scars. His light-grey eyes have a compassionate, 
intelligent gleam, and he seems to smile more than frown.

An austere, stark-white mare stands here vigilantly~
   Sleek, muscular and beautiful, this mare has a strong and 
graceful demeanor. Brilliant sapphire-blue eyes look 
intelligently about, their long dark lashes flickering 
occasionally. A flashing, silvery-white mane flows from her 
neck, silken and straight, and the rest of her coat is a glossy 
snow-white to match. She stands proudly, her conformation 
indicative of a steed built for both beauty as well as strength 
and speed in warfare.

a sour-faced, pale-skinned lad~
A sour-faced, pale-skinned lad attends to the stables reluctantly.~
   This lad has seen too few summers outdoors and too many 
muccking out stables. His pale skin does nothing to add to the 
sour expression on his face and the muttered grumblings of 
complaint emitted from his thin lips. Pale blue eyes and a shock 
of ginger hair gives him a surprised expression, although the 
stooped frown of his shoulders belies his height and emerging 
muscles.

A coal-feathered, intelligent-eyed falcon glides upon the air here.~
   This falcon's feathers are a fine, glossy coal-black color, 
small slivers of grey accentuating the dark color. Long wings 
connect to the body of this bird, its underside a light greyish 
color, coming to a sharply curved beak. Above its beak rest two 
deep black, intelligent-looking eyes, constantly darting. It is 
truly a majestic bird, in fine shape.

a tall, plump raven-haired man with charcoal-eyes~
A tall, plump raven-haired man with charcoal-eyes stands here.~
Tall and slightly overweight, this man is an imposing presence. Well
coifed raven-hair frames a chubby face with ruddy cheeks. Charcoal eyes
peer out from either side of a rather large nose. He appears to be
fairly well muscled beneath his bulk, but does not appear to be one
who partakes in rigorous physical activity on a regular basis.

Thunderfoot Thunderhoof fiesty silver-coated coal-maned stallion POFEORUN UNIQUE~
a fiesty, silver-coated, coal-maned stallion~
A fiesty, silver-coated, coal-maned stallion stands here, stamping the ground now and then.~
This Graehim stallion stands tall, just a little over 
eighteen hands in height. Powerful muscles ripple under 
silver hair which shines in the right light. Contrasting 
the color of this stallion's hair is a long flowing 
charcoal black mane and tail. He has a broad chest and 
strong shoulders and flanks hinting at a sturdy stride. 
Long powerful legs come down to thick coal colored 
fetlocks protecting his lower leg. Thick black hooves 
which look to be potentially dangerous stick out below 
the shaggy fetlock hair. Deep intelligence shines in this 
horses large black eyes. This stallion could not be 
mistaken for anything other than a warhorse even by the 
most untrained of eyes.

a white-haired old gaffer~
A white-haired old gaffer is here.~
This old man's white hair hangs in wisps down to his face. He appears
rather stern, with a slightly distant set of grey eyes. His sharp nose
hangs over thin lips, small wisps jutting from his chin, possibly the
remains of a beard. His body is frail with old age, hands trembling,
and his legs are skeletally thin like the rest of his body. Sad eyes
gaze out, wisely surveying the world.

a new mobile~
(null)~
   Stern and unyielding, this member of Minas Tirith's elite 
Citadel Guard wears a constant mask of dour emotions, if any 
emotions at all. They bear an unsurpassed scrutiny towards all 
who pass, never relenting for a moment in their constant watch of 
Minas Tirith. Their hands are never far from their weapons, and 
they rarely speak, if they make any noise whatsoever.

   This old veteran bears the scars of many battles at the side 
of the soldiers of Lord Eradan. Protecting the entrance into

man bears the air of a sergeant in his manners of speaking and 
ordering those around him.

A transparent being with a beard is here walking around aimlessly.~
   This being has an average build for a gondorian human. 
However, when looking at it the background behind him is still in 
view. The beard that dangles from what would seem to be a face 
is grey in color, like the rest of the body. When this being 
walks, no footsteps can be heard.

A black-haired man with deep, platinum-grey eyes stands here, intently watching.~
   A tall man of slender build exhibits a quiet confidence in 
most of his actions. His astute eyes are of a deep platinum-grey 
that peer out from under a moderate brow. His face is kept clean 
shaven with its features pleasant and smooth, and symmetrical. 
His head is crowned with a thick mane of pitch-black hair that 
parts so as to flow down over his ears to just touching his 
shoulders. His shoulders are broad and sit atop a torso that 
tapers nicely to a trim waist. His legs and arms are long and 
lithe, and complement his height and build perfectly. His light 
skin is slightly tanned and unblemished. His overall appearance 
one of being well cared for.

bodies are scratched and covered in sores. The child's face is 
deformed, bulging lumps of bone protruding from their chins and 
temples.

a thorn-armed, black-veined, eyeless human~
A thorn-armed, black-veined, eyeless human sniffs the air here.~
   This humanoid has pale skin and is naked. Their face is a 
flat lid of white skin writing with throbbing black veins, no 
eyes or mouth or ears over the white bald head, but with small 
tufts of black crow feathers sticking out in places around 
snoutish nostrils. They move with awkward long steps, their 
limbs broken and twisted, some with feet turned backwards or 
hands bent back into their arms. However, each has a long 
razor-sharp thorn extending three feet from their elbows where 
arms and hands should be. Their bones poke through their skin 
but no blood can be seen and no pulse is beating on their bare 
chests except for where black veins wrap around them and give off 
a glistening beat. It sniffs the air, seeking something out.

a huge pulsing fleshy ball with an enormous maw gaping~
A bloodied, fleshy ball as large as a house with an enormous gaping maw.~
   Imagine a large ball of flesh as large as a house, then add a 
gaping toothless mouth. It sits heavily in the much and 
excrement, pulsing, dark red veins pulsating as the whole ball 
tremors with every beat of its corrupted heart. The stench it 
gives out is revolting and within its maws strange shapes can be 
seen moving. This mammoth creature is truly an abomination. 
   Surrounding it are lashing fleshy thin tentacles, covered in 
barbs and sweepign the area close to it.
