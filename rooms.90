A Narrow Hallway~
   This hallway is rather short and narrow, leading from the 
archway south a small ways only to provide access to a 
plain-looking door to the east as well as one to the north. The 
walls have been freshly-painted a light peach in color and a 
small lamp has been affixed to the wall to provide a constant, 
dim light.

   The four walls of this modest bedroom have been 
freshly-painted a peachy hue. The hardwood planks which make up 
the floor are somewhat worn yet still sturdy. Occupying the 
western wall is a sizable window curtained by ivory linens while 
to the south, a door leads out into the narrow hallway. A hook 
has been set into the wall, allowing for a lantern or lamp to be 
hung.

   Mildly-worn hardwood planks make of the floor of this small 
bedroom, the walls freshly-painted a peachy hue. It is plain in 
design but capable of bearing a few pieces of furniture. It has 
no window, instead relying upon a lantern set upon the wall to 
provide lighting in this comfortable room.
