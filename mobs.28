a bald-headed, braided-beard man~
A bald-headed, braided-beard man stands here.~
   Towering over most men, this man's broad shoulders and thick 
neck define his entire build as one of corded, sinewy muscle 
tissue. His head is shaven completely bald and kept free of any 
hair growth; in contrast to his face which bears a well-groomed, 
blonde beard that is kept in a pair of thick braids. His flesh 
although a fair milky tone has a warm rosy hue that borders just 
under the surface of his cheeks and hands. His cobalt eyes are 
shadowed and seem smaller then normal under the pronounced bone 
structure of his browline and the pair of thick blonde eyebrows. 
His thick corded legs, most often, make his gait seem clumsy and 
slow.
