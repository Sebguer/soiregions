greatsword gigantic rusted PROFICIENT METAL TROLL~
a gigantic, rusted greatsword~
A gigantic, greatsword has been left here, rust over the blade~
   Too large to be gripped by the likes of a normal man, this 
greatsword is a titanic specimen of its kind, nearly eight feet 
tall in total. Its mammoth blade appears battered, rusty and of 
poor quality, yet its slightly dull blade still seems as though 
it would easily be capable of cleaving a man in two, were it 
wielded by a hand strong enough to lift it.

torc necklace serpent DUNLENDING METAL wire twisted-wire silver iron~
a twisted-wire, serpent headed torc~
a twisted-wire, serpent headed torc has been cast aside~
   This circular torc is made of thick silver and iron wire that 
has been spun to form the body of the piece. It is meant to sit 
around the base of the neck, with its opening facing front, a gap 
between the ends. Due to its construction, it can be easily 
stretched open and closed without stressing the metal too much. 
It widens toward its back, tapering to either end. Each end is 
widened slightly to accommodate the stylistic form of a serpents 
head.

A pair of light, night-black leather shoes lay here forgotten.~
Considerable talent has gone into the making of these shoes. A
subtle work of leather, these fine shoes are dyed a night black with
a dark finish to prevent any light reflecting from them. The tops
and sides are hard and durable, but starting from the point of the
foot and continuing to the heel of the foot along the bottom of the
shoe the leather has been reinforced by what seems to be velvet,
giving the wearer a silent stop on any surface. Small grooves have
been made in the velvet to provide grip, and the shoe itself is
snug.

a brilliantly shining pair of steel platemail leggings glint in the presence of light.~
   Forged by the hands of a master, these leggings are composed 
of steel and fashioned into the form of platemail. Bearing a 
high shine, they glint brilliantly in the presence of light and 
possess the air of being extremely durable against any form of 
attack. Bearing no form of mark or symbol, these leggings are 
rather spartan, lacking all form of aesthetics, but they are 
absolutely superior at allowing the wearer a stout defense.

knee of the wearer. Glistening in contrast to the black leather,

difference. Although masterfully crafted, the sabatons do lack
ornamentation, being composed simply of unengraved steel.

a beautifully-crafted, articulated steel breastplate~
A beautifully-crafted, articulated steel breastplate has been left here.~
   Burnished to a reflective sheen, this breastplate looks to 
have been constructed with both a mastery of the craft and a love 
of the piece. Of two pieces, the chest and abdominal plates 
overlap and are hinged seamlessly to flex with the needs of the 
wearer. They have been crafted to resemble the taut muscles 
housed underneath. The edges are rounded at the neck and arms 
for comfort. Pauldrons, attached by stout leather straps, are 
shaped in the form of fiercely roaring dragon heads and protect 
the wearer's shoulders. Stretching across the back are a series 
of leather straps that carefully balance the weight of the piece.
