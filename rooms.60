A Cramped Archway and Tunnel~
   A narrow stone archway gives way to tunnel, the stone roughly 
hewed leaving its surfaces rough and jagged. The floor, rough but 
so jagged slopes gently downward and leads towards the south. A few, 
thick cobwebs hang from the walls close to the southern end of the 
passge. A slight feeling of apprehension hanging in the stale air.

A Cobwebbed Tunnel at an Arched Dead End~
   Thick cobwebs line this roughly hewed tunnel, its walls and 
ceiling jagged and threatening. The floor, just slightly smoother 
than the rest of the surfaces slopes upwards ever so slightly 
towards the north. A stone archway, sealed with an odd collection 
of yellowed skulls and mortar, lies to the south. The many eyeless 
skulls gazing forever outward, casting an ominious tension in the 
stale air of the tunnel.

A Torchlit Underground Tunnel at an Arch~
   Large steps, leading towards the south and sharply down have 
been savagely cut in the stone here, thick cobwebs clinging to 
the walls as the passage descends. A stone archway leads to the 
north, flickering torches set in stone scones, burning on either 
side. The walls of rough and jaged stone, a contrast of shadow 
and a dull orange light. The stone floor is covered with an odd 
collection of yellowed skulls and broken bits of aged mortar.

orange glow from up the stairs highlighting the numerous nooks
and crannies created by the rough surfaces of the tunnel. Sections

At a Sigil-Inscribed Door at the End of a Sloping Underground Passage~
   The slope of this balmy underground passage meets a door in 
the rocky face to the south, a myriad of complex and twisting 
sigils engraved upon it. Torches sputter eternally in their 
sconces, casting a dull orange light over the passage and lending 
the sigils a fiery glow. Above the door at each side sit a pair 
of sentinel gargoyles - one leers with twisted lips and fearsome 
eyes to the passage that stretches above and the other with 
numerous piercings and spiked ears watches the ground at the 
door.

A Vaulted, Torchlit Foyer Stretching East to West~
   This shadowy foyer is wide, stretching from east to west for 
some distance - at either end black curtains are enveloped in 
darkness. The high crimson vaults of the room are barely visible 
but sloping support pillars are illuminated by sombre orange 
torches that flicker eternally in their sconces. The floor is 
well polished and the area immaculate and austere, lending the 
myriad of sigils inscribed over nearly every surface an 
impressive display. Besides echoed footsteps through these dark 
chambers, the place is quiet and the atmosphere almost balmy. 
   An archway gives leave to a pillared chamber to the south, 
structured around an immense abyss in the ground.

A Thin Tunnel Through the Wet Rock~
   This joining room is thin, cut from the black rock of the 
earth. A musty smell lingers in the air and drips can be heard 
beyond hollow gaps of the jacked rock walls, their surface almost 
slimy with algae. Like a veil, a black curtain is drawn across 
the western side of the passage, a heavy stone door to the east.

An Obsidian Pillared Chamber Around a Gaping Abyss in the Floor~
   Two hemispherical alcoves partner this elaborate circular 
chamber to the east and west, the walls and floor covered almost 
at every inch with engraved black sigils. Smooth obsidian 
pillars hold the domed roof with resilience, decorated themselves 
with glaring gargoyles that watch in an almost animate way over 
the chamber. Opening up in the centre is a gaping abyss, no 
barriers to restrict access. The abyss begins to slope away with 
the south portion of the chamber and a wide bridge gives way. 
   A cramped stairwell hewn from the rock winds a path onto a 
landing in the abyss below.

   Hewn into a nearly circular cavern far beneath the surface, 
this common area is cast mostly in shadow, lit only by candles 
whose dull orange flicker isnt ample. The cavernous room is 
musty and moss and slimy algae grow in places along the dark 
black walls. The room is sectioned into two parts by a natural 
jagged pillar of rock that thrusts through the floor and merges 
with the shadowy ceiling. Some drab furniture has been scattered 
around the room, even some rock tiers being used as benches. A 
symbol mimicking the shape of a scythe has been engraved on the 
western plank door.

with the dull black of the rock. The tunnel here comes to an end 
and a heavy stone door has been made in the eastern wall.

A Wide Obsidian Bridge Over an Abyss~
   Supported by its wide span and its short lenth, this finely 
crafted bridge hangs above the maw of a perfectly dark abyss. 
Besides the glossy obsidian masonry of the bridge, naught else 
can be viewed over the edge or up into the air, no ceiling or 
bottom in sight. The walls extend in a concave fashion from the 
beginning of the sides of the bridge and quickly blend into the 
pitch murk. This oppressive darkness has been modestly countered 
by the setting up of slow burning torches every few feet, on 
alternate sides. The flames weave and flicker as wind from the 
surface whirls inside the tunnels - the light playing across the 
bridge's smooth exterior and revealing tantalising glimpses of a 
prestigious number of sigils and symbols. These normally 
invisible ciphers shimmer independently to non-marked obsidian 
even if no trace of carving is visible. The sheer number of 
them, the majority fierce characters composed of thick lines, 
hint at the incredible amount of work that has gone into the 
construction of this indefatigable bridge.

A Wide Obsidian Bridge Over an Abyss~
   Supported by its wide span and its short lenth, this finely 
crafted bridge hangs above the maw of a perfectly dark abyss. 
Besides the glossy obsidian masonry of the bridge, naught else 
can be viewed over the edge or up into the air, no ceiling or 
bottom in sight. Ever so very gradually, this half of the bridge 
begins to ascend towards the heavy imposing double doors at its 
highest end. The network of torches, the alternating torch to 
light one's way every few feet, has its gap increase along with 
the slope. This steadily reduces the brightness of the light as 
the distance to the double doors lessens, while two large 
braziers, one off to each side of the outward opening doors, burn 
like beacons in the chill winds of the abyss. In furious 
patterns, which strangely enough become more and more obvious in 
the encroaching darkness of the bridge, are rows upon rows of 
scattered sigils and symbols, some designs bordering on stylised 
versions of ritual murder or the terrors which lurk beyond the 
light. These images reflect dully in contrast to the well 
polished obsidian worked bridge's surface.

A Majestic Obsidian Room Etched with Sigils~
   While modest, this domed chamber makes up in majesty what it 
lacks in size - a myriad of sigils have been etched over nearly 
every inch of the walls, floor and vaulted dome ceiling. 
Miniature alcoves have been hewn into the rock of this 
subterranean room where candles illuminate the shadowy area in an 
orange glow. The sigils, while ranging vastly in size, shape and 
depth, are arranged in columns as if there was a natural order to 
them. Central to the chamber is a slender obelisk hewn from 
obsidian and polished fiercely; it rises right up to the very 
centre of the domed ceiling and over its surface too are etched a 
myriad of sigils.A draught blows nearly constantly through the 
balmy underground here, the candles creating dancing shadows over 
the crimson vaults and pillars of the room.

A Stone Landing Around a Chasm~
   A subterranean draft blows through the gaping chasm that opens 
out in the rock of the earth to the south, making torches sputter 
in their sconces and cast shadows on the walls. The landing is 
somewhat precarious, given its proximity to the edge of the abyss 
around which this tier of rock is built. The surrounding walls 
of black rock are mostly flat and circumnavigate the vast drafty 
hole. A complex myriad of sigils has been etched nearly over 
every inch of the surroundings, in neat lines and columns. A 
number of doors and archways have been built into the rock.

   This subterranean chamber has been hewn from the black rock 
underneath Tur Edendor into a circular opening and several 
individual alcoves. In each hemispherical alcove at least two 
rock shelves have been carved in tiers as well as a circular 
hollow in the wall to store items. Bleary torches sit in their 
sconces sputtering to lend the sombre and deadly quiet place an 
orangey red glow. The ceiling has been vaulted with a rich red 
wood in a complex lattice though it is only rarely visible in the 
dark upper shadows of this musty chamber. A solid door has been 
made from the black rock of the chamber in the western wall.

   Opening up off the side of the landing is a formidable abyss, 
one holding firm against the underground winds washing over it. 
The landing itself is a modest track cut from movement around the 
centre pit and provides access to the lattice of thresholds and 
arches that make up the outer walls. The rock has been cut away 
smoothly, leaving no sharp edges or abrupt cracks on the 
walkspace. Lit by a supporting set of torches, a matrix of 
arcane sigils are flickeringly visible in the smoke choked 
brightness of the slow burning wood. These symbols, skillfully 
worn into the very rock itself, run in planned rows and columns, 
covering every inch that reflects in the subterranean landscape.

Stone Landing at the Mercy Of A Deep Abyss~
   Around the outside of the abyss in the centre of this 
subterranean chamber is this very landing, a landing that emerges 
from the surrounding rock wall as a precisely cut, if perhaps 
thin, method of travelling to the relevant door or atrium hewn 
also into the rockface. Given sconces, torches have been set up 
and maintained to provide the necessary light for safe travel 
along the landing but in the shifting gusts of wind from within 
the abyss, their flames hack and wheeze their way through the

exempt - the area is covered in these reflective marks.

made to restrict access to the chasm that opens up like a gaping 
mouth, a draft constantly making itself present to flicker the

A Precarious Landing Circling the Abyss~
   Although built with solid grounding from the rockface, this 
landing that circles around as a bridge to carry one across the 
circumference of the abyss is a little too thin to be perfectly 
safe and requires constant vigilance of the edge at all times, 
lest you have a death wish. Oily torches have been placed in 
scones every few paces in order to light the way - they do that 
just fine, but they also reveal the extreme multitudes of runes 
and sigils drawn onto every exposed surface that catches the 
light. These images are arranged in careful pattern, many 
containing stylised people committing acts such as murder or 
skinning.

arches that make up the outer walls. The rock has been cut away 
smoothly, leaving no sharp edges or abrupt cracks on the 
walkspace. Lit by a supporting set of torches, a matrix of 
arcane sigils are flickeringly visible in the smoke choked 
brightness of the slow burning wood. These symbols, skillfully 
worn into the very rock itself, run in planned rows and columns, 
covering every inch that reflects in the subterranean landscape.

Landing Before A Large Marked Door~
   A subterranean draft blows through the gaping chasm that opens 
out in the rock of the earth to the south, making torches sputter 
in their sconces and cast shadows on the walls. The landing is 
somewhat precarious, given its proximity to the edge of the abyss 
around which this tier of rock is built. The surrounding walls 
of black rock are mostly flat and circumnavigate the vast drafty 
hole. A complex myriad of sigils has been etched nearly over 
every inch of the surroundings, in neat lines and columns. A 
number of doors and archways have been built into the rock, the 
most impressive being a heavy wooden door, locked tight, and 
marked by the firm symbol of a bisected triangle.

Rock Landing Leading Around a Deep Pit~
   A wide bridge looms over the abyss far above the stone landing 
here, blocking out much vision of the hewn rock ceiling far even 
above that. Around this thin landing there has been no effort 
made to restrict access to the chasm that opens up like a gaping 
mouth, a draft constantly making itself present to flicker the 
dull orange torchlight in dancing shadows. The black rock walls 
are etched in neat columns and lines with complex and awkward 
sigils as well as the doors that are built into the surrounding 
walls.

A Modest Library~
   Cut straight out of the surrounding rock, this room is 
obviously a library for its number of shelves and tables. How 
good of a library is up for debate - its collection of books is 
austere and the majority of the shelf space is empty. The 
majority of its current contents are all older books, beginning 
to fall apart under the strain of their yellowing age. Posted up 
on the wall, directly opposite the heavy wooden door, is a fine 
portrait of a solidly-muscled, grim-faced man, either side 
highlighted by a dim candle to draw attention towards it.

At the Bottom of a Shaft Climbing to the Surface~
   Small dips in the floor are the recipient of the steady slimy 
drips of water that has wound its way through dirt and stone 
alike to collect in this tunnel. Above you, a shaft pulls away 
to the surface but unfortunately, the walls have been cruelly 
worn smooth and thus any escape attempt has been rendered 
impossible. A tunnel opens up northwards, the perceptive will 
note that the air becomes ever chillier as one approaches it.

A Winding Turn Infested with Glowing Mushrooms~
   The floor begins to gradually climb and the air filled with an 
overpowering chill as you continue through the tunnel. Your eyes 
begin to adjust as the ambient light level increases, a 
blanketing wave of purple glowing little mushrooms cover the 
walls and ceiling. Their skin is transparent, the glow coming 
from within each stalk and cap and judging from the dry and 
shrivelled husks littering the ground beneath the walls, it is 
not an effect that lasts long when detached from their fungal 
peers. The tunnel twists eastward now, into darkness.

The Tunnel Sloping Upwards~
   A strong purple glow is visible to the west and a strong blue 
one to the east, but across this stretch of tunnel, there is no 
ambient light to speak of. It is sloped upwards, towards the 
blue light, and is a fair trek as the rocks underfoot are 
slippery and loose. This, as well as the little rivers of water 
that run down it, any movement up the gradient would thus need to 
be slow and precise if there's to be any chance of surmounting 
the climb. It is deathly cold here, painfully even, and the echo 
of dripping water is a constant.

End of Tunnel~
   Coming to a head here, the tunnel rounds off as the sides 
close in. Worn smooth by hand, its surface is covered in a 
wealth of well drawn symbols that easily mirror light if any is 
present. The floor is quite damp, with water apparently leaking 
from miniscule cracks in the ceiling and trailing down the walls 
to run wild and free down the slope westwards. In the middle of 
the wall blocking movement east is a slight impression in the 
stonework, cut roughly into the otherwise perfectly worked stone.

A Hazardous Rock Shoot Through the Earth~
   A hazardous rock shoot plummets down into the earth here, a 
strange and awkward atmosphere engulfing the surroundings. Harsh 
winds whip through the area, whistling loudly as they coarse up 
and down this staircase hewn from black rock. The stairs are 
awkwardly hewn and obviously barely used judging by the loose 
rubble. Light wont do you any good here.

An Intersection of Slimy Rock Tunnels Through the Earth~
   This narrow rock tunnel is thin, cut from the black of the 
earth. A musty smell lingers in the air and drips can be heard 
beyond hollow gaps of the jacked rock walls, their surface almost 
slimy with algae. To the east is a simple plank door engraved 
with a symbol that mimics a scythe in design.

A Low Earthen Room with Plank Supports~
   This small room seems to have been cut mostly from soft earth 
and soil though it is supported with wooden slats and planks to 
quite a degree, covering most of the wall and floor areas - the 
musty smell gives away the earthen surroundings. One or two 
candles have been set in hollows in the wall but for the most 
part, this underground room is enveloped in darkness. In the far 
eastern corner of the room a ladder leads up to a square-shaped 
board.

A Dark, Cramped Pit in the Earth~
   This pit has a distinctly earthy musk and water drips from the 
high points to stagnant puddles on the cold floor. There is 
little to be seen except rock and earthen walls and small opening 
in the ceiling that is covered with an iron-barred door. Insects 
make their home in cracks and holes in the walls and crawl 
frequently across the floor.

A Shadowy Room Carved from Black Rock~
   This modest room comes across as quite dingy with little light 
from a handful of candles making shadows dance on the black rock 
walls. It is roughly rectangular shaped and there has been 
little effort to make the jagged walls decorative in any way at 
all. Cobwebs cling in small curtains to the darker corners of 
the room. There is a constant calm, sombre feeling that 
dominates this subterranean chamber far beneath the surface yet a 
cold breeze often whistles under the door.
