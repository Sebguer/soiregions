Base Room for Falco's Docks~
   In this zone there'll be a number of docks for Falco's Captain
Auger to prance around in followed by his pack of floozies.
I suppose we could let some other people come to them as well.

A Wide Boardwalk By A Limestone Watchtower~
   This sturdy dock is wide, and made from strong dark wood, 
clearly weathered by time, but still firm. To the south lay the 
waters of the River Sirith, as they lap gently at the posts 
holding up the boardwalk in the dock inlet. Across the narrow 
waters, one hundred feet to the south, the other half of the dock 
is visible. Piles of crates fill up parts of the dock, 
surrounded by groups of sailors and dock workers. To the north 
the dock is hemmed in by large warehouses, old and weathered, and 
the limestone crumbled in places. 
   The dock continues to the east, while to the west past three 
high watchtowers and the city wall, lies the River Sirith.

A Wide Boardwalk Stretches East and West~
   Made from hundreds of long, dark stained planks of wood, this 
boardwalk is around fifty feet in width, from the water to the 
limestone warehouses which border all around the docks. It 
stretches over a hundred feet to the east and west, filled day 
and night with sailors and dock workers from the trading vessels 
which are moored everywhere. The dark waters several feet lower 
than the boardwalk reach a hundred feet southwards, to the other 
half of the docks, and to the east the inlet is joined by more 
sturdy boardwalk. In the distance to the east, the inlet waters 
meet with the River Sirith, passing by great watchtowers of 
smooth limestone.

A Sharp Turn In The Study Wooden Docks~
   The sturdy wooden boardwalk turns at a right angle here, 
stretching a long way to the west, though it is hard to see how 
far due to the huge number of sailors and dock workers who bustle 
about the docks at all times of the day, shifting crates of goods 
back and forth from the warehouses which line the dock. Towering 
above the warehouses to the east, the top of three high water 
towers is visible, their surfaces smooth and strong, made from 
white rock, though their ancient splendor is diminished by the 
crumbling of the rock at the top of the towers. Many boats and a 
smaller number of larger vessels lay bobbing in the waters, 
moored at the docks as some vessels attempt to maneuver through 
the organized chaos, out of the dock inlet, and into the waters 
of the River Sirith to the east. 
   To the north, between two weathered, limestone warehouses, a 
large, ornate arch stretches between them and to the north 
stretches a wide road.

A Wide Boardwalk At The End Of The Dock Inlet ~
   The boardwalk stretches nearly a hundred feet from the 
northern and southern corner, and to the east the waters of the 
inlet which the dock is built around it visible, stretching 
around three hundred feet before it meets the mouth of the River 
Sirith, flowing into the great River Anduin. Piles of sodden, 
infested ropes lay coiled upon the docks by thick black mooring 
posts. Several groups of dock workers and sailors stand around 
at all times of the day, talking loudly, or handling crates of 
goods from the ships and boats moored at the docks. 
   Immediately at the eastern edge of the boardwalk, it is lined 
by high, limestone warehouses, while to the north and south the 
dock turns at a right angle, continuing west.

A Sharp Turn In The Study Wooden Docks~
   The dark, weathered boardwalk turns at a right angle, heading 
northward and westward. The dock is bustling all times of the 
day, with sailors and dock workers shifting crates into the 
nearby limestone warehouses which surround the dock to the east 
and south. In the corner is a small gap between the warehouses 
where they meet. Along the waters edge on the wooden boardwalk 
there are an even spread of black metal posts, some with boats 
moored to them. The metal of these posts is chipped and 
weathered in places, though they still remain sturdy. The docks 
are raised several feet from the waters surface, which is dark 
and laps gently from the movements of trading vessels in the 
alcove into the island.

The Wide Boardwalk Continues East and West~
   The wide, sturdy boardwalk continues to the east and west, 
always busy with traders and sailors moving crates of goods into 
the high warehouses which line the docks to the south. The docks 
are an inlet into the island, situated between the mouths of the 
River Sirith, and the Great River Anduin itself. The dark, oaken 
boardwalk is over forty feet from the water to the warehouses, 
and it stretches over a hundred feet east and west. Many small 
trading vessels are moored at the docks, and fewer large ships 
between these. 
   All around the docks are signs of ancient greatness, from the 
lofty warehouses, to the high watcher towers visible to the east, 
smooth and strong, but crumbling and weathered at the top.

A Wide Boardwalk Ends By A Limestone Watchtower~
   This sturdy dock is wide, and made from strong dark wood, 
clearly weathered by time, but still firm. To the north is the 
waters of the River Sirith in the dock inlet, lapping at the 
posts which hold up the boardwalk. In the water there is 
constantly the movement of ships and boats, loading and unloading 
goods to trade. Piles of crates fill up parts of the dock, 
surrounded by groups of sailors and dock workers. To the south 
the dock is hemmed in by large warehouses, old and weathered, and 
the limestone crumbled in places. 
   The dock continues to the east, while to the west rise two low 
walls, leading to a small courtyard at the foot of a high 
watchtower, crafted from white limestone by the stone workers of 
old. It is adjoined to two more similar towers by a high wall, 
crenellated and strong, but weathered and old. Past these lies 
the River Sirith.

Rath Minsir At The Gates To The Docks~
   Rath Minsir, the river road, runs north east along the island, 
parallel to the city wall. Emerging from the docks to the south 
from between two lofty limestone warehouses, and under a great 
arch, carved with a scene of a great ship with many white sails, 
it continues far into the distance, twisting a little which 
prevents seeing a great distance. One end of the scene upon the 
arch has become weathered and cracked in places. The large gate 
forged from dark steel remains strong, swinging freely upon its 
great hinges. 
   Either side of the road are many small buildings built from 
light coloured blocks of stone, there doors unlocked day and 
night to the traders and merchants who constantly throng the 
streets.

Rath Minsir Turns South And East Past Many Buildings~
   The road here is wide, traversed constantly by merchants and 
sailors, and horses pulling carts loaded with goods. The floor 
has been made from chunks of irregular shaped stone, laid in ages 
past by talented masons, the fragments fit together to create a 
smooth surface. Though from years of travelling and a lack of 
masons skilled enough to repair, the road has become uneven in 
places, with chunks missing and sticking out at odd angles. The 
shops and building which are crammed along side the road are 
mainly crafted from lumps of limestone, though the odd one made 
with timber and darker stone are visible. 
   The road here turns a little, though it remains in the general 
course of following the high city wall which is visible to the 
west above the roofs of the buildings.

Wide, Twisting Rath Minsir Heading North East~
   The wide stone road, made from large chunks and fragments of 
off-white stone, continues in a north east direction, following 
the massive stone wall which is always visible above the top of 
the buildings to the west. Here, the road twists, heading 
slightly inland, though after a few hundred yards it twists back 
a little more. At the center of this drag of the road it widens, 
and a small number of market stalls are set up either side of the 
road, visited by the constant sailors and traders moving their 
goods up and down Rath Minsir. 
   This clearly ancient road shows signs of much deterioration 
and decay, but the once great splendor is still shown by the 
smoothness of the road, despite the odd out of place slab.

Rath Minsir Heading North East Parallel With The City Wall~
   The wide stone path is here become quite broken and in need of 
repair. Many of the small chunks laid to form the path have 
become upturned or shattered, and from the ever increasing gaps 
between the chunks grows straggly weeds and grass. The path 
however still holds a great many traders, travelling northward to 
the market, or southward to the docks. Horses pulling carts 
stacked with crates also rattle along the road. The building on 
either side of the road thin out here, leaving the great city 
wall to the west clearly visible. 
   The road twists and turns slightly as it weaves its way past 
the buildings, heading north-east, and south-west. To the east 
lies a tavern, sound echoing out of it at all hours of the day.

A Wide Junction In Rath Minsir~
   Here the ancient Rath Minsir, crafted from thousands of small 
fragments of randomly shaped rocks, laid to form a perfectly flat 
and smooth surface, meets with a road heading eastward across the 
island. Small buildings crafted from stone and with flat roofs 
are spread lightly at the sides of the road. The high, 
crenellated white stone wall is visible to the west, resting 
between the River Sirith, and the triangular island which 
Pelargir is situated upon. 
   To the north east, the road continues, twisting slightly, but 
heading generally towards the large market square. Southwards, 
the docks stretch out over the River.

A Narrow Cobbled Path Before a Watchtower~
   A limestone wall no higher than a tall man rises either side 
of this path which can hold three abreast. The floor has been 
layed with hundreds of small chunks of white stone of every 
shape, laid to somehow fit perfectly together with an even gap 
between each chunk. However, time has had the better of the path 
and wall, as it shows signs of moss and mould growing all over it 
all, and along the edges it has become cracked and broken, in 
some places showing the mud below. 
   The path is not any longer than twenty yards, leading to a 
small courtyard to the west, and the start of a bustling 
boardwalk eastward.

crumbling wall. At the western end rises a short set of steps to 
the solid oaken door of a watchtower. This tower is off-white in 
colour, high and proud. Visible at the very top, between the 
crenellations is a flag, waving lightly in any gust of wind. 
Behind the low wall, and the high watertower is visible a much 
higher wall, linking this tower to two more of similar stature.

The Stone Paved Rath Minsir By The City Wall~
   Heading in the general direction of north-east and south-west,
following the direction of the city wall to the west, Rath Minsir
twists and turns quickly at all points of its course, weaving
between buildings and houses. At this point however, the stone
crafted path twists right next to the city wall, following at the
foot of it for a few hundred yards. The wall is crafted from
huge rectangular chunks of off-white stone, towering high above
the heads of the many traders who travel this road. At the foot
of the wall it sticks out in a small ledge, providing a place
to sit with the midday sun upon ones face.

   To the south-west, Rath Minsir follows the course of the city 
wall tightly, twisting to the side slightly at times. However, 
at this point in the off-white stone path, it curves slowly 
eastward, the number of buildings at the road side becoming very 
large, as the compact stone shops vie for trade from the many 
passers by. The road, though wide and strong is old. Grass is 
visible, growing from between the cracks of the randomly shaped 
rock fragments, and some of them are cracked and loose. 
   To the east, between two large stone buildings, the road
emerges in a large, bustling market square.

The Corner of the Market Square~
   The market square is as busy here as anywhere else. Tents, 
booths and stalls have been set up all about the area, creating a 
maze of paths on the hexagonal slabbed floor, blackened with age. 
The market stretches out to the south and east, while northwards 
is the city wall, angling north-east to meet with the opposite 
wall at a huge watchtower. The constant bustle of the market 
area is offset by the general feeling of age throughout the area; 
from the great masonry of ancient days which is no crumbled and 
covered in vines, to the hawkers and merchants shouting about 
their wares, this market is extremely varied, presenting a 
typical image of this city.

to the north. There rises a massive watchtower, built from white
rock which has not taken well to time. A low wall surrounds the 
tower, and an archway with an iron gate is set in the wall, 
providing access from the market place. The market itself is
constantly bustling with hundreds of traders, hawkers and 
merchants at their small stalls which have been erected on the
old, hexagonal slabbed floor, dark with age.

The Corner of a Great Marketplace~
   This large market square is constantly filled, day and night, 
with peddlers and merchants of all shapes, sizes and origins. 
Shouting their wares from behind many a hastily erected stall, 
there always seems to be some sort of argument going on about the 
quality or price of a certain good. The city wall rises to the 
north-east, heading diagonally, north-west to south-east. The 
ancient, moss infested wall meets with another diagonal wall to 
the north, with a great watchtower at the point of intersection. 
   The hexagonal flagstone floor is in many places cracked and 
broken, revealing the hard packed dirt beneath. The market 
continues to the south and west.

bustling entrance to the large market square of Pelargir 
stretches north and south a short distance, and slightly further 
to the east. The stone paved path which makes up most of the 
rest of the city is forsaken here for larger, hexagonal slabs, 
which have become blackened and dirtied by many years of carts 
and peddlers moving about. Some slabs are missing, or broken, 
leaving potholes and the dirt visible underfoot. 
   All around are market stalls set up, filled with exotic goods 
brought in by ship and boat. Many peddlers hawk their wares 
loudly, creating a noisy atmosphere constantly.

   The center of Pelargir's market square is the busiest part of
the whole city. People of many hue of skin gather here to buy or
sell goods at the booths, stalls and tents which have been erected
everywhere upon the coppery coloured flagstones. Age has had a bad
effect upon the stones however, marring them mostly dark, and many 
are cracked or broken, revealing the hard packed dirt underneath.
   In the very center the booths, stalls and tents come to an
abrupt halt and there rises three great statues which seem to
command respect.

A Bustling Market~
   At this eastern entrance to the Pelargir Market Square, the 
road which slopes off to the south-west meets with the hexagonal 
flagstones of the market. They are blackened and cracked from 
age, and from the constant movement of carts pulled by mules, 
carrying boxes and boxes filled with various exotic goods to be 
placed on the many stalls and tents erected seemingly randomly 
throughout the square. 
   There is no clear path between the tents, instead one has to 
snake their way through the hustle and bustle of the many people 
constantly gathered here, and try not to get lost in the maze of 
booths and stalls.

square, filled with people of many different skin colours,

Underwater in a Deep, Murky Pool~
   Here in the pit of the tunnels, a pool of dark, rancid water 
has formed in the dug-out area below. Pillars carved with 
angular runes and blocks of stone carved with similar runes hint 
that this was not always full of water. The sound of steady 
dripping echoes off the walls, though the source is not visible.

The End of a Dark Tunnel in an Underground Lake~
   A dark tunnel ends here at the edge of an underground lake of 
murky water. A tunnel continues to the north, the only other way 
is down into the dark water. Along the sides of the wide tunnel 
thick pillars of stone have been erected to support it. The lake 
itself is still in only the way that such subterannean places can 
be, not a ripple or other source of movement visible within it.

Skirting the Edge of an Underground Lake~
   The damp tunnel snakes around a corner here, ending at the 
edge of murky water. The path widens near the edge of the water, 
a large symbol engraved in the rock upon the ground. The carved 
path takes any trespassers here directly against the water's 
edge, where it laps at the stone a mere six or seven inches from 
the feet of the travelers. Along the western way, the lake 
curves, gently cupping the stone flooring. The western floor 
seems to slide over a higher portion of rock and seems to be only 
some two or three inches deep.

   The tunnel angles sharply here from south to west, the rock 
itself carved away with sharp precision. The wall sconces and 
brackets continue on in their regular interval, with little to 
mark this underground corner as unique. Those of sharp senses, 
however, would pick up a faint moisture in the air towards the 
western way, a wettening.

   The tunnel continues its twisting, winding path through the 
stone, still cut with a sharp attention to cruel, hard corners 
and the strange, odd designs still thrown in at seemingly random 
intervals. Steps throughout this item-less area echo 
resoundingly, with any bold enough to wear armor sending a mass 
of echoes moving up and down the stone.

stone.

A Gentle Turn in the Tunnel~
   Rather than a hard, abrupt turn as most of these tunnels seem 
to sport, this change in direction is more of a gradual, patient 
sort. In this part of the tunnels, the only decoration upon the 
walls being the iron wall sconces and brackets to hold dark, 
fuel-less torches. Despite the stillness of the air and general 
silence, the odd echo of a falling stone or drip of water is 
still audible through the labrynth.

A Straight Course Through a Dark Tunnel~
   The dimensions of this straight course through the dark stone 
is prim and proper, as if whoever had carved such a pathway had 
been the owner of a perfection's eye for detail. The floor and 
walls are smooth, their joining sharp rather than dulled or 
curved, showing the signs of the high level of care put into the 
proper carving. In almost complete silence, the tunnel 
straightens on from north to south.

   While this tunnel seems to hold a generally straigh southernly 
course, a curve of the northern way is dimly visible through the 
bad illumination of the area. The stone walls themselves show a 
bit of a loss of smoothness and perfection here, a few jutting 
pieces presenting a fingerslength away from the wall to cast odd, 
frightening shadows onto the floor.

   The tunnel here holds a deadend to the east, as if the 
original plans had been lain to expand in that direction. The 
dent in the eastern wall is only some two or three feet in length 
before it straightens into its fully fleshed-out south-to-west 
path. Save that two or three feet long mistake, the rest of the 
walls are smooth and cut with skill.

A Sharp Curve in a Dark Tunnel~
   This curve is formed with an abruptness that is almost 
startling, due to the narrowness of the tunnels. They are, 
perhaps, wide enough for a pair of men to walk abreast wthin 
without getting overly comfortable with eachother. Along the 
base of the southern wall there seems to be some sort of insignia 
that's been scrawled into the stone, its style looping and 
strange.

   Large columns line the walls of the area, intricately carved 
with runes and other symbols. Four tunnel-like extensions 
surround it, each leading in a different direction into the dark 
gloom. An extremely narrow tunnel winds westward, and one only 
slightly larger runs towards the east. Those to the north and 
south appear to be of average size. Every sound echoes, from the 
crunch of rock underneath, to the sound of any voices that might 
speak within.

at one end, with old, dusty candles surrounding it. Runes line 
the walls and the columns set within. The remnants of a firepit 
stand within the center of the room, lined with smooth stones. A 
faint series of cracks and lines mar the floor of this room, as 
if struck by some large blow.

A Cramped Crossing of Tunnels~
   In this small, cramped area, tunnels cross, one leading north 
to south, and the other from west to east. Each appears to be 
narrow, leading into an almost tangible darkness; anything beyond 
is impossible to see from this point. The sound of rocks and 
hardened dirt underfoot are painfully audible in the silence of 
the tunnels. Deep within the caves, the only light is that which 
is brought in from the outside, though empty sconces along the 
walls hint that light was once provided from within.

the confines of this small area. The walls are inexplicably 
moist, condensation gathering where runes have been etched into 
them. Occasionally, a splinter of bone is visible amidst the 
pebbles and dirt of the floor. A single empty sconce in good 
condition has been secured to the eastern section of this area.

considerably into an area set off to the west, where the 
concentration of the pieces of bone increases. Sconces in nearly

be found within, scattered along the ground. Runes have been 
etched into the walls, lining their surfaces with careful 
precision. Along the floor are darker areas, and the smell of 
old blood hangs in the air. Several well-cared-for sconces have 
been set at precise, even distances from each other, along the 
circular walls.

south, an intersection of tunnels is immediately visible. As 
footsteps echo against the walls, the rustling of clothing and 
armor join the sounds, creating an eerie cacophony of mingling 
noises. Brackets clearly designed to hold torches have been

into an even section of ground. The walls are narrow, and moist 
to the touch. Brackets holding burned-out torches are set at 
regular intervals along the walls.

marble, etched with a series of runes across the base. Atop it

Unlike most others in the complex, these appear to still be

A Square Training Area~
   This area, like the rest of the compound, has been dug out of 
the dark stone with a precise, prim skill, the corners of the 
room clearly defined. In the middle of the room, a sparring ring 
has been erected, the mat slightly raised from the cold stone of 
the floor in addition to being roped off. Signs of disuse, 
however are obvious, from the thick layer of dust to the rusted 
quality of any of the metal currently seen.

   This narrow hallway is surrounded on either side by stone,

of oak to the west. Intricate sconces of metal have been set at 
even intervals along these walls, providing light for those who 
would pass through when new torches are alit within them.

Large Sleeping Quarters~
   The walls and floor of this large room are made of stone, cool 
to the touch and haphazardly covered with rugs. Instead of 
simple bunks, however, the beds neatly lined up from one edge of 
the room to the other are of intricate build and fine coverings. 
Though it is currently dark, brackets secured to the walls devoid 
of torches, when all are full, it seems to be well-lit. A single 
door leads into a narrow hallway to the east.

The Healer's Garden~
   The floor of this airy, spacious clinic is made of 
closely-fitted white marble slabs, the stone and masonry walls 
finely finished and bearing a pristine, snow-white color. The 
outside garden, and the overall quietness and pulchritude of this 
Clinic reflects the gondorian tradition for healing, with this 
being a smaller , yet richly-appointed, version of the Houses of 
Healing in the Sixth Circle. A row of large beds are set on the 
eastern wall , where those bearing illness or injury are tended 
or rest, with the aid of the fresh, invigorating smell of garden 
outside, and the skillful help of the Master Healer. No 
chirurgeon's table is evident in place, the most complex 
procedures possibly taking place behind closed doors, as not to 
disturb the convalescents. 
   The door that stand to the north is open at all times, and 
allows light to filter through the day, aided by a wide, clear 
glass window to its side, while large, glass-paned lamps can be 
lit at night. A small door, finely burnished and made out of 
black willow stand south, offering entrance to the back of the 
Clinic.

of the resident Healer. A wide, operating table stands behind a 
discreet white linen curtain, the stone cover kept spotless when 
not in use. 
   The door that stands to the south is kept open at almost all 
times, allowing light to enter through the day, aided by a wide,

The Chirurgery Room~
   The floor of this pristine, clean room is made of fine, white
marble that almost mirrors anyone standing on it. The walls
have also been painted white, and are made of large blocks
of granite. A large stone basin stands to the east, under a
wide window, fed constantly by a pure flow of water coming
from an elaborate iron faucet. Near the tall roof, a wide 
glass window takes on the sun through most of the day, 
lighting the room clearly. In the exact center of the floor, 
a wide table, with a stone top, sits solidly, lighted by a 
large skylight. Fine lamps are set on the walls, lit at night,
setting the place in a constant, persistent light needed
for the chirurgeons to work.
   A beautifully door made of black willow stands to the 
north allowing entrance to the main room of the clinic,
while a white door allows further passage to the 
back of the clinic to the west.

   This well-appointed, wide dormitory serves as a rest and study
room for whichever person learns under the attending Master
of the Clinic. Airy, thanks to fine glass windows to the north 
and south walls, the place is quiet and sports the same, 
mirror-like white marble of the other rooms. White-washed
walls of sturdy masonry support a long shelf full of aging
tomes, a wide repository of medical knowledge. Two large,
comfortable beds and a long table allow the occupants to
rest, study or relax with ease. Glass lamps are set on the walls
to keep the place well-lit at night. A fine door made of 
white-willow wood stands east, leading to the chirurgery room.

Moving Through A Narrow Schism~
   This area is only wide enough for one man to walk abreast, 
seemingly utter natural in its formation rather than having been 
touched by the hand of man. There is no floor to speak of, as 
the bowed, harshly-angled walls come to a point, making walking 
through this area awkward to say the least. For all intents and 
purposes, it looks as if this area was simply created whenever 
some schism forced the section of the wall to separate.

   This area, perhaps some ten feet by ten feet, looks to have 
little worth note--the ground is still roughly hewn to be 
flatish, despite its roughness. The walls are of grey-black 
stone that, rather than being touched by any tool of man, look to 
have been sheared away from its counterpart on the other side of 
the room through natural means. A small pile of feces, its scent 
having long ago been stolen by the ages, sits in one corner.

distinguishing feature of this cavern, however, are the massive 
blood spatters that cover an entire corner. They have aged to 
the point where they are dried and hold that unique black-brown 
of thickly dried blood.

way narrows down to only allow one man to walk abreast this area 
here has been opened by the force of the explosion, walls, 
ceiling, and floor all blasted. Black scorch marks lay heavy

   The smooth, accurate architecture of the underground cave 
system continues here in a set of cleanly-cut stairs, some 
handful of steps in all, that lead slightly southwards. The 
fingerlength deep water spills over them and, judging from the 
smoothed nature of the stairs' edges, has been for some time, 
dulling the acuteness of their stonework. The smoothly-cut 
hallway itself continues south, water perhaps a hand deep now.

rapidly over the ankles of any travelers here, moving westwards 
now in the dark tunnel.

   The middle of this long stairwell, which stretches both down

twenty-five feet above its landing on the southern end, the sound 
of trickling water filling the area and echoing through the 
surrounding passageways as the liquid rushes down the long length 
of stairs. The integrity and sharpness of each stairs' angle has 
been eroded by what seems to be a good deal of time since the 
water began to run over it. The northern stairs, however, show 
none of this wear and tear, each angle still acute and sharp as 
it rises upwards.

Surrounding a Vast, Bottomless Hole~
   The set of stairs that enter from the northern way is the only 
viable entrance into this rather large room, its dimensions some 
fifteen by twenty feet. The entirety of the walls, floor, and 
ceiling have been painstakingly enruned, the harsh symbols 
leaving a vague aura of distaste present in any good-aligned 
person. In the center of the room, there appears to be some kind 
of circular altar, its center missing in a perfectly circular 
fashion. As the water rises and rises to the perhaps four-foot 
tall top of the altar, it slowly spills down into the hole in a 
never-ending stream. Disturbingly, no sound of splash is heard 
as the water pours silently into the abyss.

this area seem remarkable, the same iron wall sconces here as in

water can be heard from the southern darkness.

   A cleared area of ground surrounds this white washed 
structure. Horizontal logs form the walls of the structure. At 
the corners the logs have been notched to allow the logs 
interlock with one another. The notches and roughly even log 
size combine to make minimal chinks between the pieces of lumber, 
but the chinks that do exist have been packed with clay or some 
material. There is a single, odd sized door on the northern side 
of the building which requires navigating a relatively base and 
low door frame. The roof is composed of birch shingles.

A Rustic Hall~
   This rectangular room is fairly large. The floor is made of 
hard packed dirt, and the walls are of unfinished wood. The 
bottom most logs appear to be hickory while birch and pine form 
the rest. Over all, the room is fairly rustic and simple with 
minimal efforts made of creating a comfortable living space. The 
lack of windows, flooring, and anything other than the 
utilitarian necessities of walls and a roof make it a fairly 
dismal abode. A bit more effort seems to have gone into one 
corner than the rest where hide hangings serve to screen it from 
the rest of the room. A ladder in the center of the western wall 
leads up.

Inside a Hide Partitioned Area~
   This hide hemmed in area is big enough for, perhaps, a couple 
of close together bunks. Hides line the walls and are strung up 
to provide some privacy from the rest of the room. While not as 
secluded as a separate room, the bearskin partitions are slightly 
better than nothing.

A Loft~
   This loft is floored with roughly hewn pine logs which have 
been split in two. The logs have been generally placed with 
about an inch of space between each other, extending from the 
middle to the front of the building. Not exactly a spacious 
place, the low, slanting roof serves to make it feel even more 
confined. The rafters are composed of more pine logs while pine 
lumber covered by birch shingles serves as a mostly functional 
roof. Light and smoke travel through the holes at each end of 
the building, just under the eaves.

A Storage Closet~
   This utility closet has been set up with shelves for the 
simple storage of pantry foods and other items. This portion of 
the building has been built of the same stone floor and 
whitewashed masonry walls as the rest of the clinic. There are 
no windows and the only exit is to the east that leads back to 
the kitchen.

A Large Cellar~
   The temperature in this room is usually rather cool. Like the 
rest of the clinic, it posesses the same stone floor and 
whitewashed walls. The cellar looks like it stretches underneath 
the entire clinic, making it a rather large room. Rows of 
shelving and racks can be seen along the walls. Some of them 
hold various tools. By the look of it, the room has been set up 
with different workstations. Some areas have workbenches while 
one area to the very end looks closed off from the rest of the 
cellar. That area holds a sturdy, grey marble table as well as a 
tray with several rather sharp objects. There is a very sterile 
feel, but often a fresh smell that comes from that area. Through 
the wooden timber ceiling of the cellar the faint sound of voices 
can sometimes be made out. Set in the northwest corner is a 
small staircase leading out.

A Large Walkin Closet~
   Furnished elegantly with stained oak pannels lining the walls, 
this spacious closet can easily hold racks of clothing as well as 
abundant space for two people to easily change. Under foot long 
streches of hardwood flooring lie, polished and varnished to a 
near mirror sheen. Around the room itself, turned wood rods 
allow masses of clothes be to hung. A trio of glass lamps hang 
from the ceiling bathing this room in a warm glow.
