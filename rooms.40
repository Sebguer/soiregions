Outside the Gates of Moria~
   In the face of the mountain is a yawning gateway, flanked by 
two broken doors, that leads into the shadow-filled halls within. 
So deep is the blackness there that it is difficult to 
distinguish the space beneath the stone arch as a passageway or a 
wall of pure obsidian. Facing the southeast since its formation 
ages past, the portal looks back to the dale that stretches away 
to the south, over rolling foothills and a regal lake not a 
league hence. Outside the gates is a spacious stone plateau, 
smooth despite the untold years of exposure to the elements. 
Leading up to it is a grand stair, spanning over two-hundred feet 
in height, that begins on the ground at the mountain's roots so 
far below.

plateau stairs ground~
The ground here is remarkably flat, and all carved from the solid
rock of the mountain.  A few cracks and fisssures stretch across
it occasionally, but no other signs of wear can be seen.  Stairs
stretch downward to the east, all uniform in size and at least a
hundred feet wide.

doors gates~
These two massive doors are made of solid stone, and are at
minimum fifty feet high and twenty-five feet in breadth.  They
hang ajar and tilted, their hinges long broken as they lay back
against the mountain, now a part of the natural environment
as much as anything else.  Covering the doors are countless
runes and carvings, most of squat, bearded figures carrying
axes or hammers.  The scenes vary, with some of the figures
mining, some battling with numerous creatures, and some shaking
hands with elves and men.  The largest symbol on the doors here
is that of a hammer and anvil, surmounted by seven stars.  Time
and the elements have worn on these doors, and in many places,
moss and lichen grows freely.

Try as you might, you just can't make out what the speck at the

Snow glistens on the mountain peak far above.  Against the white

Within the Blackness at a Set of Gates~
   Locked within the blackness of the First Hall, this immense 
chamber is far beyond measure by any means. To the east lies a 
set of gates that stand broken from their hinges. Within this 
chamber is a blackness that might only be broken by fire that is 
drawn from a torch or brazier. Carved into an artistic form, 
pillars of mammoth size stand about this area and lead to a roof 
which hides in the blackness of above.

Within a Great Hall of Khazad-Dum~
   Being in the midst of a Great Hall, this path is the center 
road that leads directly east and west through the First Hall of 
Khazad-Dum. This road of smoothed stone is open and empty, 
giving an amplitude of space. To the north and south of this 
grand road are a pair of stone pillars that have been 
artistically carven to bear the image of a rising vine that 
travels from the base of the monolithic pillars into a place 
unseen as they move into the darkness that obscures the roof of 
this hall.

Following a Road Through the First Great Hall~
   Leading through the ruins of the First Hall of Khazad-Dum, now
little more than an ancient and decrepit remains of glories past,
this broad and seemingly unending road makes its way east towards
the gate while continuing westward into the engulfing abyss that
moves deeper into the dilapidated remnants of the dwarven ruins.
Residing in a place that is far beyond sight and veiled by the
blackness of eternal night, somewhere a roof looms above the
unoccupied space that is the First Hall.

only a space open and unobscured by building or structure, the 
floor of this vast area is a flat surface that runs off in all 
directions save to the west, where an immense wall stands stern 
and proud as it journeys into the darkness that veils the far 
away roof. To the east of here stand to monolithic pillars that 
reach from their solid bases that bolt into the face of the floor 
to the ceiling that is concealed by the blackness.

east, the path travels towards a gate that lies far out of 
eyesight. Here, the road funnels into a corridor that is given a 
roof that is more confined than the vast openness of the 
unbounded Great Hall, and yet, much traffic might have once 
flowed through here when this ancient ruin was yet alive and 
flourishing.

course of this bridge. 
   To the east, the bridge leads towards a plaza before a stair

path that spans the length of a great chasm, joins the two far 
ends that border this bridge together. The chasm below cuts from 
the north to the south, all kept under a roof of stone that looms 
high above this place as an unseen roof of immense size. Raised 
above this abyss that is deep beyond measure, the stalwart stone 
formation seems capable of bearing a great weight despite being

connects the eastern and western sections of the Halls of Durin.

   Broad and capacious, this ancient road of great size makes its 
way through the eternal night of the subterrenean world of the 
Second Hall of Khazad-Dum. Far above head, a ceiling hides in 
the pitch black of the darkness. In all directions, the Great 
Hall continues on, filled with darkness and going for a distance 
that is far longer than anyone's capability of sight. This road 
is smooth despite the fact that it now leads through the ruins of 
an ancient dwarven city.

broad and leads from east to west, either end of this trail 
spanning far beyond sight as the way continues seemingly forever

until it vanishes into the darkness that veils the distant roof.

   Lying to the east is a ledge that drops off into an abyss of 
black that travels further into the earth to an unknown place of 
total darkness. Moving westward from the chasm, the chamber is a 
vast and capacious hollow that has been cut from the stone of the 
mountain to form a portion of the Second Great Hall of 
Khazad-dum. With infinite black surrounding this place on all 
sides, it is not possible to determine how far this chamber 
continues on, but it is certain that this place is locked under a 
roof formed by the mountain although it cannot be seen because of 
its lofty place above this chamber.

   Of an incredible size that is unrestrained by any form of 
barricade, this portion of the Second Hall is a massive hollow 
that has been carved from the stone of the mountain in days of 
the ancient years now long gone. On either side of this immense 
chamber is a stone pillar of monolithic size that rises from its

Running on forward in any direction, the floor of this chamber is 
a planar surface of stone, worn well by its many long years of 
use.

In the Darkness of the Underground~
   Locked beneath the surface of a mountain, this place is of an 
incredibly immense design that is incomprehensible. Built in the 
long ages that have now passed, this once great hall has begun to 
show signs of ruination and decay. Although yet sturdy and 
holding fast against the slow wearing of time, one might easily 
perceive that this place has begun to feel the effects of its 
lengthy neglect and disuse.

In a Monolithic Cave~
   All about this place lingers an all-consuming darkness that 
looms over this place. Incapable of being dispelled, the rare 
appearance of light might temporarily displace the darkness that 
fills this cavern buried well below the surface of a tall range 
of mountains. To the south of this place, the rock that creates 
the base of one of the many mountains that are members of the 
range creates a large wall that forms the barricade which will 
prevent any travel further south from this place.

    Branching from the Second Hall, this long tunnel proceeds 
forth in a vast archway that would easily allow the passage of 
a great flow of people to travel through the smooth, grey stone 
from which the passageway has been hewn.  From the ceiling hangs 
several ancient lanterns of a oft burnt and blackened iron; the 
chains which support these lanterns are thick and rusted, 
obviously showing a great many years of disuse.

An Arched Passageway~
   Moving through the cold, grey stone, this large passageway is 
cut into the form of high arch that gives ample space to any 
passers-by. Hewn through the stone by an ancient skill, the 
walls and semi-circular ceiling possess a smooth surface that one 
might gently glide there hand over to feel it is devoid of jagged 
bumps or mars. 
   This hallway was once fed light by lanterns that hang from the 
ceiling, but these oft-used lanterns no longer feed a steady glow 
to the area.

Along a Capacious Corridor~
   This capacious tunnel is a broad pathway with a high ceiling 
that affords an ample amount of space for a heavy flow of traffic 
to proceed along. However, this corridor is dwarfed when 
compared to the grand chamber which opens to the west of this 
place. Once well-carved and crafted by the work of masters, this 
tunnel is a work of art that is both functionable and 
fashionable. Now, the fashion of the tunnel has begun to fade, 
however, leaving the tunnel to perform its functions through the 
long, dark years.

A Narrow Off-Shoot of the Main Road~
   Narrow in build, this small pathway springs from the wide 
passageway lying to the south.  This path quite clearly once 
catered to frequent travellers, but today, it lies in disuse; 
left to sit motionless in time with only a pair of fire-marred 
lanterns to mark what used to be as it terminates in a broken 
door still clinging to the hinges of the stone frame.  The door 
was once a wooden wonder covered in intricate desgins, but no 
longer is such the case.

Upon a Street of Massive Size~
   Traveling through the eternal darkness that is ever present in 
this subterranean world of ruin, a trail leads, once a street of 
great proportions, from east to west. This road appears to 
travel infinitely in either direction, its great length making 
its furthest ends lie far beyond any hope of sight. Upon either 
side of this road is a massive stone pillar that leads from its 
stalwart base in the floor to unseen heights that are concealed 
within the darkness that shrouds the roof of this place.

   The road, formed in the ancient years, now lies in a state of

longer receives the attention it did in the ancient years gone 
by. The street is of immense size and its length is immeasurable 
in the darkness of the Great Hall. Upon either side of this 
grand road is a single pillar of monolithic size that juts from 
the ground and proceeds to the hidden heights above.

Moving Through the Great Hall~
   Leading through the eternal darkness that reigns over this 
place, the grand road that once played host to the hordes that 
lived in the once magnificent Halls of Khazad-Dum is now a path 
that merely leads through a land of ruin and desolation. Out of 
the memory of most, the well-worn pathway is now untended and 
without proper maintenance. Standing sentinel upon either side 
of this worn course is a pillar of stone. To what heights the 
pillars lead is imperceivable due to the fact they are shrouded 
by the blackness of this subterranean world.

center of the absolutely expansive chamber that is consumed with 
the pitch black of a moonless night. Always does the same 
darkness linger over this place. Unbroken and undisturbed due to

   Stretching along far more distance than any might perceive

Carved to bear decorations of an elegant and elaborate sort, to 
the north and south are a pair of pillars. Serving both function 
and fashion, the pillar extends from the base of the floor to the 
heights of the ceiling concealed far above this place.

blackness of a void lingers here that seldom is dispelled. Once 
filled with hordes of residents, this grand chamber was once kept 
lighted and was beautiful to look upon. Now, the grandeur of 
this place has long faded, and only the darkness resides within 
these ancient ruins.

it is near to impossible to see any form or shape of the walls 
that lie hidden within the caliginous veil that obscures them. 
To the north of this place, a road of sizable measure runs, 
stretching east and west through the darkness. In all 
directions, mammoth pillars rise up from the floor, leading from 
their bases, embedded deep within the floor, to their unseen 
peaks that are obscured where the ceiling is suspended, hidden 
within the opaque wall of shadow.

that lacks the grand crowds that once filled this place.

Those that brought ornamentation to this place are no more. It 
is a place of shadow, past glories drained from the ruins that 
now stand deep below the surface of the mountain.

but to the north, the tunnel arrives at what appears to be a set

place has begun to decay; now being more of a functionable place 
without its lost glories to decorate its walls.

   Opening up to the west, this corridor proceeds towards a set 
of stairwells that lead either up or down through the grey stone 
that inhabits this section of the mountain's underground. East 
continues the corridor in much of its current state. Neither 
altering in the look of the grey stone walls nor erring in the 
direction of its course.

Upon a Grand Stair Ascending Through the Stone~
   Leading upward at a sharply bent angle, this place is hooked 
to lead southward along its landing or westward as it makes an 
ascent along the stone stair. Bordered and secured by the grey 
walls of stone, this place is an accomodating rest, being of a 
level and flat plane along the ascending course.

A Landing Between Two of Khazad-dum's Deeps~
   Filled with the darkness that infects all areas of this 
subterranean ruin, this landing along the long stairwell resides 
here in the stone with no more than the dark to fill its grand 
course. Being of ample size, the course could easily allow the 
many bypassers that once populated this ruin to travel along this 
course.

this landing sits at the foot of yet another set of stairs that 
ascends through the grey stone. To the north continues the 
landing that comes to the top of the stairwell leading downward 
from this place. All about, the grey walls possess the artistic 
markings that decorate much of the course along this stairwell.

Upon a Spacious Landing of Stone~
   Branching off in three directions, the path to the north is a 
continuation of the platform of stone that serves as a landing 
for this lengthy stairwell as it ascends and descends the stone. 
To the east, the long, dark corridor leads into one of the many 
Deeps of the ancient ruins of Khazad-Dum. To the west, the stair 
leads downward, traveling further towards the mountain's heart.

Upon a Path Leading Through the Dark-filled Tunnel~
   Straight and untwisted in its course, this tunnel leads along 
the cardinal directions of east and west without fail. Eastward, 
the path proceeds further down a passageway that is very similar 
to this course. Here, the walls are of grey stone, covered in 
runes and images that are of an artistic nature. The floor is a 
flat and smooth path, wide enough for a great host to travel. 
Above lingers a ceiling of the same homogenous, grey stone. 
Westward the course changes, becoming more suited to the style of 
that of a landing before a stair.

its final landing. The course now levels and moves either to the 
east or west. To the east, the tunnel has been carved and 
crafted to be a place of fair design, much as this portion of the 
tunnel is. To the west, the course steadily grows more to be of 
a scabrous nature, hewn and carved into a rugged pathway.

A Dark Corridor Leading Through Grey Stone~
   Affording an amplitude of space, this tunnel would permit for 
many individuals to pass through this corridor without causing 
crowding in the slightest. Not only offering a great width, the 
tunnel allows for a great height that would not hinder any from 
traveling through this place. The grey stone that lines this 
corridor creates a dark-filled passageway of great size and is 
made to be smooth and flush.

the grasp of the mountain's rock, this Hall is always held by an 
eternal night, kept forever in darkness as the many great fires 
that once burned here are no more. Now, the beauty and decor 
that did ornament this place are gone, and all that is left is 
the vast emptiness.

the border of this place may not be seen, but instead, pillars of 
stone lie in view, bordering either side of this road that leads 
east and west through this place. Once covered in much 
decoration, the images that were carved into the stone have begun 
to fade, leaving the pillars with naught but their functionality.

size. Formed and carved into the stone by the care of masters, 
this pathway has been worn into its current form to be a street 
providing easy travel through an area of accomodating size. The 
course is lined by pillars that bear the faintest carvings that 
slowly fade to become no longer existent. All about this place 
is the darkness, created by this grand road being locked within a 
chamber that is below the surface of a great mountain.

stone monoliths that rise up in their great row now fall into a 
state of simplistic function, supporting the roof as it looms 
high above the floor. Now, barren and filled with naught but 
stone pillars, this floor bears the signs of great wear. Once, 
it was host to hordes of peoples that have long since abandoned 
it and left it in the darkness to slowly fall into disrepair.

At the Foot of the West Wall~
   Covered in many artistic carvings, the western wall that is 
rising up from this place has been decorated with the etchings 
that were long ago embedded in the face of the grey stone. 
Lifting itself to great heights, the wall of stone runs upward 
until it comes to the roof of stone that looms high above this 
place in the darkness that fills all this deserted chamber.

Within the Darkness Filling the Great Hall~
   Covered with many carvings of an elaborate nature, the stone 
of the walls possess an air of beauty despite always being lost 
in the impenetrable shade caused by the surrounding stone. The 
walls, though unkept for many centuries, have retained and held 
much of their former glory, the deep etchings still easily 
visible should flame be present, or one possess the eyes 
necessary to pierce this darkness.

   Here, two walls come together at a perpendicular angle to form 
the southeastern corner of the Fourth Great Hall of the ruined 
Khazad-dum. To the west of here lies a road of ancient design 
and expansive size, and between the road and this place, one row 
of pillars runs along, bordering the large path.

In the Dark-filled Chamber, Along the Eastern Wall~

heart, this place is ever darkened to the point of being black as 
pitch. Never given to sun, this place may only be lit by the 
work of flame. To the west, columns of stone rise up and form a 
long row that spans the distance of the ancient road .

this passageway becomes one of the Great Halls of the ruined 
Khazad-Dum that are many in number and are of immense size. This 
place now lies in a state of disuse, forgotten and left to its 
self for a great time.

creates the feeling that the tunnel is miniscule despite its 
decent size. Large and expansive, this place is filled with 
darkness, which only adds to the effect of its size. Nigh to 
impossible it is to see to the other side of the Hall lest a 
great blaze be giving light to this place.

Within a Dark-filled Chamber~
   Passing along an ancient road that leads that darkness of an 
immense chamber, this course moves along east and west. Wide and 
carved into the floor to create a smooth surface for easy travel, 
this long disused pathway was cut into place in ancient days now 
faded to memory, yet remains serviceable due to the amazing skill 
of the crafters. All about, this chamber that slowly begins to 
creep into dilapidation stands in testimony to the skill of those 
who formed its grand pillars, its stern walls, and its lofty 
roof.

is both large and well-crafted. Journeying on westward, the 
course leads through the expansive chamber. To the east, the 
road leads into a corridor to ends that cannot be seen through 
the thick darkness that prevades all this subterranean Hall. 
   The chaotic chattering of orcs intensifies to the north here, 
and at times guttering fires can be seen blazing along that 
northeastern wall.

creating impermeable barriers that will allow no travel. East

lining the course along its journey.

At the Center of a Spacious Hall~
   Lying at the center of a Great Hall, this grand road, of 
ancient formation, was once the sight of much hussle and bussle. 
Now, it lies forgotten in the dark, undisturbed and silent at 
most times. Slowly falling into a state of disrepair, this road 
creeps through the years without any maintenance or care-taking 
to maintain its once flawless surface. Upon either side of this 
road are magnificent pillars that rise up; however, they now 
begin to show the same disrepair that has begun to take hold of 
the road.

Within a Chamber Filled with Impenetrable Black~
   Approaching an enclosed corridor, this road continues its 
journey through the darkness as it moves to leave the Twelveth 
Great Hall of ancient Khazad-Dum. This path, aged beyond count, 
maintains much quality, but pales in comparison to what it once 
was. Disrepair and sparse use turns this pathway into nothing 
more than a ragged course leading through eternal night.

In the Northwestern Corner of an Immense Chamber~
   Covering much of the walls, artistic designs are embedded 
within the stone, giving an artistic appeal to the pale, grey 
stone that rises up sternly from the ground until it reaches the 
lofty heights where the ceiling resides. To the north and west, 
these walls rises up, but to the south and east, the chamber 
opens up into an expansive placed filled with darkness.

Passing Along Through the Darkness of a Great Hall~
   Passing along north of a grand road, this place is located at 
the north of a very large chamber that is locked within the grey 
stone that composes the heart of a mountain. Formidable and 
filled with darkness, this chamber was once filled with designs 
of beauty and elegance. Now, these things are gone, leaving 
behind a ruin that stands here in a solemn state. Across the 
pillars that line the road to the south, once beautiful carvings 
can be seen, faded and near to disappearing forever.

making the descent into becoming a decrepit ruin, this place 
watches as its former glory disappears into the darkness that 
fills all this Hall. To the south, a stand of pillars move in a 
straight line from east to west, bordering what appears to be a

stone that forms much of this mountain's interior. The road is

easy to travel and providing an affording course. About this 
aged street stands walls of stone. The walls of stone hold the

was a place of grandeur.

The North of a Great Hall~
   Placed at the northern edge of the Great Hall, this place is a 
portion of the vast chamber that continues off into all other 
directions save to the north. Formed in the ancient years that 
have long since passed, this place has begun to show the signs of 
wear, but yet, much of its original beauty and structure is 
remaining strong as it stands through the slow passing centuries.

An Open Expanse in the Dark~
   Immense and open, the Great Hall runs in all directions save 
to the north where a stout wall of stone rises up from the floor 
and reaches into the hidden heights of the blackness. The floor 
of this place in the Second Hall is well-worn and altogether, it 
is easy to tell that this place was forged into the stone a great 
many centuries ago. To the south of here stands a lone pillar of 
stone that protrudes from its base at the ground until it reaches 
the lofty heights of the ceiling formed by the mountain.

At the Edge of the Vast Abyss~
   Positioned at the eastern edge of the Second Great Hall of 
Khazad-Dum, this grand place is sitting at the very edge of an 
enormous chasm and spanning westward into the darkness that is 
the Second Hall. On the western edge of this vast area, pillars 
of monolithic size rise up from their place in the stone of the 
floor to journey upward into the darkness that veils the ceiling 
of stone that is hanging beyond sight.

Through the Immense Expanses in the Darkness~
   In the darkness that shrouds this area, this place sits in the 
eternal night that is the ruined city of Khazad-Dum. About this 
place in all directions runs the vast scape of the Great Hall. 
Seemingly endless, this place is lost amongst the dark, however, 
to the north might possibly be seen the grand road that runs 
through the ever-advancing distance of the hollowed Halls. High 
above this place, resting atop the sturdy stand of the pillars is 
a roof that cannot be seen for it is veiled in a place where no 
light resides.

Amongst the Subterranean Ruins~
   Lying far to the south of the wide road that leads through the 
Second Great Hall, this place is a grand openness that sits in 
the eternal night. Decrepit now and beginning to show the 
initial signs of falling into decay, this ruins now stands in a 
suspended state of dilapidation. Standing about this area are 
several pillars of stone that are of mammoth size and lead to 
roof of stone that remains veiled by the darkness pervading the 
Great Hall.

the wall of stone that creates the southern barrier that fences 
in the Second Hall of Khazad-Dum. To the north of here, pillars 
of stone rise up from their base at the floor and travel the 
distance immeasurable into the heights that obscure the roof of 
this place. Doing likewise, the wall runs into this lofty place 
to reside at a height unviewable.

South of the Main Road~
   Here in the eternal blackness of this once grand city that has 
long since fallen into ruin, there is a blackness that alone 
fills the now deserted place. Decaying further, this place ever 
continues towards a state of deeper dilapidation, slowly guided 
to its decrepit state by the efforts of the long centuries that 
crawl by in the darkness of this subterranean world.

Along an Unbounded Road~
   A grand road in the days that have now faded away, this road 
leads east and west through the decrepit ruins of the ancient 
Hall of Khazad-Dum. This road is very broad and could sustain an 
enormous flow of traffic with the greatest of ease. In size, 
this chamber is utterly unimaginable. Seemingly without bound, 
this place continues on in all directions untethered by anything 
save the darkness which stands eternally in all directions. 
   To the north and to the south, a pair of massive pillars lead 
upward into the darkness. Supporting the roof that is hidden in 
the black veil of eternal night.

In the Eternal Night of the Subterrenean Hall~
   Filled with the blackness as though it were a void, there is 
the constant effect of a lack of natural light. Always locked in 
the darkness, this chamber is of a massive size and the dark is 
absolutely consuming and devours all that stands within the 
hollow nothingness that lies in the silence of an unoccupied 
void. Occasionally, a sound will emanate from some unknown place 
in the darkness only to be consumed by the abyss with no echo or 
reverberation to answer.

of grand width rises up from the floor as it moves into the far 
away heights that hide the ceiling in the darkness that cannot be 
dispelled. To the north of here, a wall of stone rises up from 
the ground. Firm and impenetrable, the wall stands stern despite 
the toll of the hard passing of years.

obscure the ceiling that looms above this place at a distance

A Road Stretching Through the Dark~
   To the west, this road leads into a vast tunnel that is of a 
grand size, but in relative comparison to the Second Great Hall 
of Khazad-Dum, the tunnel is a needle's eye. The chamber to the 
east, north, and south is absolutely monolithic. Its immense 
size is unbound by anything save the darkness that fills this 
world that is locked below the surface of a mountain. The road 
is an ancient path that leads through east and west for an 
undeterminable distance. Broad and capable of servicing to the 
needs of many, this is a vast pathway that could allow an 
absolutely enormous flow of traffic pass uncrowded.

stone whose sheer face journeys from the floor into the unseen 
heights which cloud the ceiling in darkness. Formed in the days 
of the long ago past, this chamber has begun to show the signs of 
being a dilapidated ruin, but yet this place remains sturdy and 
proud, a vision of years now long lost. As the chamber is vast 
in open in three directions, a darkness fills it and this area, 
making it impossible to see the full extent of its size.

   Filled with the darkness that seems to create an infinite 
void, this place is a massive chamber that moves out in all of 
the directions save to the east. There a wall of immense size 
runs up from the ground and reaches up to the very heights that 
shroud the ceiling of stone in pitch black. From here, it is 
impossible to see where the western wall lies hidden and the 
northern wall is likewise veiled in shadow. To the south, if 
light should be sufficient, such is rare, the southern wall may 
be barely perceived. Across the enormous wall, there are faint 
images that once ran high along its face. Now, those images be 
near to invisible.

grandeur beyond imagination, the dark, decrepit halls now lie in 
stillness; no longer are they disturbed by the hordes of peoples

   Standing stern and sturdy, the eastern wall that borders the 
Third Great Hall of Khazad-Dum is a mass of grey stone that leads 
from its place at the floor and journeys high into the darkness 
that veils the ceiling of rock hidden above. Opposite the wall 
are a pair of pillars; one standing off to the north a ways and 
the other off to the south a ways. The floor positioned between 
these monolithic icons that travel to the lost heights of the 
veiled roof is a floor smoothed and worn flat by time's gentle 
hand.

   Cut and carved from the belly of the mountain in ancient days 
that have long passed away, this chamber is but a remnant of the 
ancient dwarven city of Khazad-dum. Now a decrepit relic of past 
glory and grandeur, the beautiful decorations that once 
ornamented the walls have become faded and near to invisible. 
The images that sprawled the pillars of stone that reach to the 
utter heights of the ceiling, disappear without maintenance and 
care. All that remains of this places beautiful grandeur is the 
absolutely enormous size of this forsaken ruin.

against the northern wall that borders this massive chamber. In 
all directions save the north, the chamber continues onward into

often, continues eastward and northward in what is seemingly 
forever. However, to the south, it has arrived at the end of its

rises up to create a firm boundary of this chamber. Filled with 
the darkness that holds all underground chambers, it is difficult 
to even see the pillars of stone that are near to this place.

borders that fence in this place are beyond view. Above, the 
ceiling is out of sight and cannot be seen due to the lofty 
height at which is resides. Through this chamber moves an

and forgotten. To either the north or south, a great pillar 
rears up from the ground and leads into the blackness where the 
ceiling remains unseen.

This wall, once ornamented with much decoration, is now but a

into a place of majesty and beauty, much of what once was is no

whether to the north or south, have lost their elegance as the 
eloquent images have been lost to time.

At the Center of an Expansive Hall~
   Here, the Great Hall comes to its end as it collides with a 
pair of walls that come together in a perfect corner. Neither 
north or west is one able to proceed, the walls being firm and 
impenetrable. To the east and south, however, there is space 
beyond count that would seemingly be entirely unbound by any sort 
of border or barrier.

Passing Along the Stone Wall~
   Rising up to the west is a wall of stone that extends from the 
base of the floor to the heights above where the ceiling is 
lingering. From here, two rows of colums extend; each column is 
composed of the grey rock that forms the walls and floor, these 
pillars appear to have been hewn into shape when this place was 
cleared of its stone.

At a Corner in the Southwest of the Cavern~
   Here, two walls of stone run together to form a corner of the 
cavern of immense size. Hewn with care, the corner of the 
chamber is square, both walls meeting perfectly perpendicular. 
To either the north or east, this expansive chambers extends 
outward, filled with dark and columns of stone.

   To the south, a row of pillars rise up, creating the great 
supports that hold up a ceiling of stone that lingers far above, 
looming in the heights to create an all-consuming darkness. To 
either east or south, it is impossible to find the distance at 
which the stone walls hide, and to the west, only should a great 
supply of fire be available could one perceive the wall.

   Given to the darkness, this chamber is locked within borders 
of stone and for this it is ever held by an eternal night that 
may only be broken with the light of a flame. Upon the wall that 
runs the length of this portion of the chamber is many designs 
that, being carved in ancient days, have sat here in this cavern, 
being worn upon by time's slow crawl.

south, it also moreso impossible to even catch a glimpse of the 
stone that creates a wall, being that this place is at the far

designs that have withstood the weathering of time's slow crawl 
as they sit, locked in the darkness always, in their subterranean 
home.

is but one small patch of the far greater whole. Desolate and 
without natural light, only with fire or eyes accustomed to this 
consuming dark could one begin to perceive the fixtures of stone 
that rise up to the south of this place. Only with these means 
could they begin to see the faded carvings upon the northern wall 
or begin to see the smoothed and worn nature of the floor upon 
which passersby rarely now travel upon.

At the Meeting of Two Walls~
   Here, two walls come together, forming what is the northeast 
of this Great Hall. All about these walls are the faded marks of 
once elegant carvings, however, time and disrepair is unkind to 
these decorations. Now, they fade into the stone, losing their 
easy visibility. To the south is a row of pillars that possess 
similar carvings that begin to fade as those upon the walls. All 
about, the grey stone begins to lose its original ornamentation, 
descending from its former glory to become merely functional 
structures.

found, rising up from the floor of the stone until it reaches the 
lofty heights at which it unites with the ceiling that is formed 
by more of the mountain's stone. To the south, the path that 
leads through the darkness is lined with pillars of stone; these 
pillars bear similar markings and carvings of the walls, the 
faded ornamentations that once decorated this Great Hall.

Come to the Eastern End of a Great Hall~
   Coming upon the end of this Great Hall, there is a tunnel that 
assumes the look of a narrow passage when compared next to this 
chamber of absolutely immense size, but in truth, the path leads 
into a passage of great size, allowing for flow along this street 
to continue on with no form of funneling to be seen. Now left to 
be decrepit, this place loses much of its grandeur; the grey 
stone that once bore many elaborate carvings begin to see their 
beautiful imageries fade from sight and memory.

nature were carved into the face of the stone, however, those 
images have now begun to fade and disappear from existence as the 
wear of time slowly creeps past. To the east, two columns of 
pillars journey onward. One column to the north of here; one to 
the south of here.

near to smooth, but there remains slight evidence of having been

A Long Road Arriving at the Eastern Wall~
   Passing along through the darkness of a stone-walled chamber, 
this ancient road makes its journey east and west before arriving 
at the far eastern wall of the enormous chamber. At that point, 
the road enters a tunnel that passes through the grey stone 
unhindered.

   This tunnel, expansive in width and reaching in height, moves 
east and west through the stone that passes forms the eastern 
wall of one of old Khazad-Dum's Great Halls. Being of simplistic 
design, this abandoned tunnel once bore the symbols of ancient 
carvings, but now they fade and disappear, leaving no mark of 
their former presence.

a hall of grey as the road passes between two great chambers that
are buried in the depths of the mountain. The road that leads 
through this darkness is a path of stone; wide and spacious, it
would allow for many to travel here with no crowding.

In a Great Hall's Northeastern Corner~
   Coming to its northern and eastern ends, this Great Hall has 
been fenced in by two walls of grey stone. From the grey floor, 
the walls spring up, traveling the heights into which the roof 
dwells. To the south of here, a row of columns come up from the 
ground to stand sentry over the road beyond.

   Filled with the darkness undispellable, this ancient chamber 
is bordered to the north and west by the walls of stone that once 
beared engraved with images to decorate the flat face of the grey 
stone. The road to the south is lined by pillars that mere these 
now faded designs.

Within the Blackness of a Great Chamber~
   Once formed into a grand chamber kept within the darkness of 
the grey stone's snare, the Great Hall has now fell into a state 
of disrepair. The stone, once elaborately decorated, no longer 
bears its ornamentations and the pillars to the south have lost 
their former grandeur and remain merely functionable as they hold 
up the ceiling far above.

Part of the Grand, Old Chamber~
   Filled with the deepest of darknesses, this chamber, grasped 
by the stone of the mountain's belly, is locked in an everlasting 
night that cannot be dispelled because of the sheer volume of 
this cavern. Once made with elaborate decoration and 
ornamentation, the faded image of engraved scenery upon the stone 
walls still resides in its disappearing form, difficult to even 
make out the original picture.

the south of this location. Running parallel to these pillars a 
wall of stone resides to the north of this place, and to the east 
or west, passage is unhindered by any formation of stone.

stone rise up to the east and south of this place in the Great

great pillars to the north yet holding up the massive roof of

edges smooth and straight. The other walls of this vast hall are

rising up toward the shadowed ceiling, are massive, their ornate 
bases cracked and worn but still solid despite having held the

distance and darkness. To the north, there is perhaps a glimmer, 
though it is too faint to tell what it may be. Immense stone 
pillars rise up toward the shadowy ceiling far above, with only 
cold, stale air occupying the huge, empty spaces between them. 
The enormous carved bases of the columns are worn and cracked, 
but the detailed, angular designs are still clearly visible, a 
testament to the masterful stonework of their builders.

stale. A faint, steady ta-tap is audiable, echoing softly from 
the center of the area, with long pauses between each sound; a 
constant drip of water seems to be the cause, the tiny droplets 
falling from somewhere in the darkness overhead. The smooth 
stone floor is stained where the liquid has pooled, creating 
strange, curving shapes on the ground.

In the Southwestern Corner of a Massive Hall~
   Two massive walls converge to the south and west, creating a 
corner to this vast, dark hall. The other walls are lost to the 
distance, and only the nearby columns are visible, their massive, 
ornate bases carved with intricate designs and covered in many 
faint, jagged cracks. The spaces between the immense pillars is 
empty, filled only with cold, stale air.

Along the Southern Wall of the Great Hall~
   The south wall of this vast hall rises here. An archway with 
a door is set into it, the surrounding stone seeming the only 
section not covered in runic designs. The rest of the vast hall 
stretches away into darkness, with only a few immense columns 
visible, rising toward the shadowed ceiling far above. Their 
ornate, carved bases, though worn and cracked, appear to be 
strong and solid. The air here is cold and quite stale.

In the Darkness of a Dilapidated Great Hall~
   The southeast corner of this dark hall is cold and dank, the 
air here stale and smelling of damp earth. The converging walls 
are cracked and worn, their surfaces heavily pitted. Though some 
of the carved designs are visible, much of the stonework is too 
damaged to make out anything. The rest of the vast hall 
stretches away into the distance, much of it hidden in the 
darkness. Thick columns stand at regular intervals, their 
immense bases appearing both ornate and strong, despite the 
massive amount of weight they must be supporting.

   Two massive stone walls converge to the south and west, their 
pitted surfaces worn and crumbling; entire sections have fallen 
away, leaving the stone rough and cracked. The floor is littered 
with debris, some of the shattered fragments still bearing faint 
runic designs. Northward and eastward, the vast hall stretches 
into the distance and is lost to darkness. Here and there, huge 
pillars rise toward the ceiling, their massive, ornate bases worn 
but otherwise solid, continuing to bear the weight from above 
despite the passage of time and, from the stains running down the 
length of some of the columns, likely the passage of water as 
well.

A Grand Chamber Now Fallen Into Disrepair~
   A massive wall rises to the south, its surface pitted and 
cracked. Intricate runic designs have been carved into the 
stone, though time and the occasional drip of water have worn 
away some sections. The rest of this vast hall stretches off 
into the distance, disappearing in the darkness. Standing in the 
gloom are enormous columns, their huge, ornate bases crumbling, 
but still strong and solid enough to hold up the weight from 
above. The air here is cold and stale, and smells of damp earth 
and dust.

Within the Dark of a Cavernous Hall~
   The air here is cold and stale, and carries the smell of damp 
earth and dust. The area has a stillness that is occasionally 
broken by the faint sound of dripping water, echoing off the 
ancient stonework. The south and east walls of this vast hall 
converge here, their pitted surfaces slick with moisture; the 
liquid seems to be seeping through the cracks, and tiny rivulets 
make their way down toward the floor, where small, shallow 
puddles have formed, staining the ground. North and westward, 
the chamber extends into the distance, its edges lost in the 
darkness. Massive columns rise to the shadowed ceiling, their 
huge, ornate bases worn from the passage of time and water, yet 
still strong and solid enough to support the weight from above.

At the Meeting of Two Wall of Grey Stone~
   Formed into a square corner, two walls, composed entirely of 
homogenous grey stone, come together to meet and create what is 
the southwestern corner of ancient Khazad-Dum's Nineteenth Hall. 
Carved into the stone are faded imageries and scenes that depict 
scenes of battle or various images of beauty. The pillar that is 
positioned to the northeast of this place is decorated with 
similar images; across its surface a carved vine journeys along 
into the distance at which the roof dwells.

portion of the far larger chamber that resides here, locked in 
the stone of the mountain. Great in dimensions and filled with 
the darkest night, this chamber is a decrepit relic of the past, 
fallen into ruin from its former glory. The ancient chamber has 
been carved from the grey stone and pillars of this stone still 
remain, providing support for the roof that looms high overhead.

   Formed in the archaic days now in memory, this tunnel is a 
spacious place that is cut and carved from the stone that once 
dwelt in this place. The stone that now surrounds this tunnel is 
engraved artistically with various images. Although the pictures 
have begun to fade, some can yet be descried as their etching was 
once deep in the walls that have been assaulted by the 
unforgiving span of time since this tunnel was vibrant and alive 
with activity.

In a Wide Hallway~
   Far to the north, the door that leads into this corridor might 
be seen by any whom are unafflicted by the absolute lack of light 
that this place is prone to. To the south, the hallway moves 
onto an unknown location. From here, it is beyond impossible to 
descry the tunnel's end. Across the wall are artistic carvings 
that are now intensely faded and nearly invisible.

A Long, Dark Hall~
   Filled with a black the color of pitch, this tunnel is locked 
in an eternal night. Always it is black and dark unless someone 
should come with fire or light to illuminated the stone that is 
surrounding this empty corridor. Across the walls, the faded 
carvings of the ancient days may be seen if one were to look 
carefully.

In a Corridor with Etched Walls~
   Bearing a wide girth, this tunnel is a spacious passageway 
that leads through the eternal night of the depths of the earth. 
The passageway is well-constructed and despite the many ancient 
years that have passed it by, this tunnel has remained stout and 
continues to stand against any harm and resists the slow wear of 
time. Once elaborate and elegant, the etchings that were once 
inscribed into the wall have now begun to fade and grow dull.

Along the Sweeping Corridor~
   Roaming through the stone along a linear path that is 
seemingly unending in all this darkness, the passageway leads 
either north or south with no end in sight. Having a wide span 
and a moderate height of ceiling, this hallway is a spacious 
pathway that would allow for easy and fast travel through etched 
walls of stone.

   Smooth and flat, this wide pathway makes it way to either the 
north or the south. Easily traversed, this passageway's width 
and planar face make this course an excellent path. Upon either 
side of the hall stand two walls that rise from floor to ceiling 
with a flush face presented, markings running over them for the 
course of the tunnel. Above hangs a ceiling of stone that is 
neither far nor near.

   Held within the walls of stone, this tunnel has a wide floor 
that is bordered on either side by grey rock. Possessing a flat 
pathway, this passage is easy to travel along and suits the 
purpose of a hall well. Across the walls, etchings have been 
carved into the face of the stone. Now nearly faded away 
entirely, they yet remain slightly visible in this dark 
passageway.

   Arriving at the end of a long journey, this corridor through 
the stone arrives at its final destination when the stone of the 
southern wall impedes further travel. Built in ancient days, 
this tunnel has seen the long and slow passage of time, but has 
been built remarkably well and holds up yet still. Despite its 
great build, the tunnel has begun to show the signs of age as its 
walls lose the one artistic designs etched into their surfaces.

   Linking the two great corridors, this room is of a long and

it the appearance of lacking space despite the great length of 
this place. 
   Ingrained deep into the face of the southern wall, a fading 
scene can still be barely perceived. Once vivid and eloquent, 
the image of dwarven warriors assaulting a force of orcs now is 
nearly faded forever.

is a smooth path that has been well-worn due to the once frequent 
use of the now desolate place. 
   To the west, a room that shows signs of considerable damage is
standing agape and unisolated from the main tunnel.

Signs of the wear of age or signs of damage created by force have 
begun to show upon the stone. One streaked gash is particularly 
easy to note should light be present or one's eyes be accustomed 
to this eternal night. Running across the western wall, the gash 
is at the level of a man's chest and runs deep into the wall.

neglected for long, slow centuries. As a result of this 
abandonment or as the result of force, damage has accumulated

rooms that once would have branched from this place. To the 
north and the south, the look of the tunnel is sturdy and solid.

   Burrowed with little regard to aesthetics, this cavern has 
been carved by pure power. Across the high-reaching walls, many 
gashes and rents are created that run deep into the stone. 
Embedded into the stone of the floor, many divets have been

upon the stone. What has created this cavern is impossible to 
derive, but the force it has exerted has carved a mammoth cavern 
of unpleasing look.

state of ruin now that it lies in disuse. The tunnel was once 
fashioned by the hands of true masters who ornately decorated the 
stone walls that surround this tunnel. Now, the work has begun 
to fade and the absence of proper maintenance begins to show upon 
the dilapidated areas of this corridor.

A Wide Tunnel Bearing a High Ceiling~
   Designed with function and fashion in mind, this tunnel once 
bore elegant designs upon its walls, many looking to be that of a 
running vine or occasionally etchings of a field of battle and on 
occasion, a decorative pillar would be placed against the wall, 
standing in the shape of some majestic statue, but the 
decorations that ornamented this hallway have now become decrepit 
and their design now fades due to slow, long years without 
maintenance. Losing its life steadily, this tunnel has now been 
degraded to a functionable pathway that leads through the stone 
in a state of permanent black.

A Long, Narrow Room Locked in Stone~
   Slender in its width and spanning in its length, this room is 
of a narrow design that stretches for a lengthy distance. Carved 
into the stone in the shame of a perfect rectangular corridor, 
the room bears a ceiling that affords enough space for any Man to 
pass through this area without stooping. Surrounded by stone of 
a grey colour, this tunnel is dark because it lacks access to any 
light from the outside.

A Long Room with a Balcony to the East~
   Offering a balcony that peers out over a vast chasm, this room 
is a long chamber that is rather thin in comparison to its 
length. Almost like to a corridor more than a room, this chamber 
was well-formed and perfectly crafted to allow for the room's 
edge to be placed for a balcony overlooking the pitch black of 
the great chasm. The balcony is fenced by a rail carved from the 
stone.

A Spacious Room Within the Grey Stone~
   Etched into the shape of a flattened cube, this room offers an 
amplitude of width and length, but its height is limited, making 
any Man of excessive height stoop and duck. The room is bordered 
by grey stone and bears many vivid images etched into the walls, 
but some of the images have begun to fade due to the length of 
time since they were carved and more importantly, the maintenance 
they now lack.

Along the Dark Passageway~
   Progressing through the darkness along a linear course, this 
tunnel makes its way to the north and south. It is a wide 
pathway that provides ample walking space along a fine path. 
Carved in lost centuries, this corridor is well-intact despite 
the neglect it has come to known. The engraved images upon the 
grey stone, although no longer vivid, do show their original 
picture even now if the viewer's sight is not obscure by the 
blackness of the eternal night.

now a place left to ruin. Long gone, the original inhabitants 
have abandoned this place and now it is falling into ruin. The

that is formed by this bent corridor is a smooth walkway that has 
been worn down to a flat surface after ages of wear upon the face 
of the stone surface. Now, this tunnel has begun to fall into a

have now begun to fade away.

   Continuing an upward climb as it moves westward, the long and 
dark tunnel is formed into a stairwell of grey stone that is 
making a steep journey upward as it goes west. While moving east 
along this lengthy stair, one would continue to move deeper and 
deeper into the mountain's rock. Despite being ancient and now 
neglected, the etchings upon the wall are still faintly visibly 
if there is sufficient light for sight.

allow traffic to easily move down and east along the steps or

   Expansive in its size, this corridor is a massive tunnel that 
leads northward from the set of stone doors that were off to the 
south a good ways. With a floor of stone that was worn away and 
smoothed by time, the path is a course easy to travel and made 
perfectly for walking done in large groups or small. Along the 
wall, now faded images can still be seen. One bearing the look 
of a jewel and one on the opposing wall appearing to be that of a 
hammer.

for the archaic chamber beyond the door of rotting wood. 
Although unaccomodating, the height of the ceiling is taller than 
the room neighboring this place, allowing for items to be 
stacked, which increases storage space to a gracious level. 
Undecorated and without ornamentation, this room is bordered by

   This building carved right into the stone of the mountain that 
makes up the great hall. No door hangs in the eastern doorway, 
yet stone chunks hint that at one time there was a door. The 
room is dark and cold, cobwebs hang from corners and no signs of 
usage can be seen. Dust covers nearly everything in sight. The 
walls hold carvings and etchings into the stone, though they are 
barely discernible. What appears to be a large anvil is etched 
along the northern wall, as well as many old runic symbols.

and dark, down at the street below. Several stone stairs wind 
upward from the ground level and allow access to all the levels 
of housing. The rusted remains of several iron braziers hang

A Tunnel Lined With Houses~
   Cramped stone houses line this tunnel in multiple levels. 
They all face centrally with their windows and doors staring down 
at an abandoned cobble stone street. The homes are small, mostly 
of single rooms, and unadorned. They all appear to have been 
constructed of the same materials providing a uniform aesthetic. 
The ceiling is curved, higher in the center and gently sloping 
down to meet the walls. The entire cavern looks to have been 
excavated from solid stone. The cobbled street running north 
south, and the homes themselves owing their bricks to that 
excavation. This area appears to have been abandoned long ago, 
the houses quiet and the ground covered with rock dust.

A Large Long Tunnel Filled With Empty Houses~
   A stone cobbled street goes from the north to the south and 
looks to have been constructed long ago. It appears to be large 
enough to allow a single drawn cart, or three people abreast, to 
travel comfortably. Climbing away from the street set on tiers, 
are three levels of residence. These houses are small and 
closely set with single doorways agape in their faces. Here and 
there window slits are sporadically distributed one several of 
the homes. The ceiling is high and arching reaching high 
overhead.

either side of a turn in a cobbled street. Constructed of 
similar stone to the cavern they inhabit they appear to be single 
room dwellings with empty broad doors and few windows. The road 
itself angles sharply and forms a right angle.

rise up and away from the street to meet the curving roof high 
above. The houses themselves have steepled roofs shingled with 
small granite slabs. The buildings are spaced far enough apart 
to afford them small yards. Their windows and doors are darkened 
apertures that stare into their empty recesses.

stories high each, rise up and way and join the arching ceiling

to broaden into a circle surrounding a large stone fountain. No 
houses stare down here, the tiered ascent that marks the 
surrounding tunnels is absent, instead the cavern is revealed in 
all its magnitude, calling attention to the scene depicted in 
stone at its center. At the four corners of the cavern hang 
gigantic iron braziers, now rusted red, from thick chains.

A Sharp Turn In The Road~
   The road turns here, angling sharply north and east. It is 
lined with a series of broad step like levels upon which have 
been built many squat flat roofed buildings. The buildings are 
all of like design with central doorways leading inward. The 
doors are all gaping holes of deeper darkness that stare down 
blankly at the cobbled lane below. Though modest the true angles 
and functional quality of the street and the buildings evidence a 
masterful engineering. The roof arches high over head an appears 
to be hewn from the foundation of the area itself.

than its necessarily smaller southern counterpart. The three 
tiered shelves that rise up away from the cobbles continue, their 
ledges supporting a multitude of square squat buildings that once 
were homes. All organic material has either been removed from 
the area or rotted away so completely as to have left no trace.

rectangular paving stones of similar material and color as the 
cobbles themselves. Built on two rising tiers, accessible by a 
mirrored set of stairs on either side of the street, are modestly 
sized homes with arched stone shingled roofs. The buildings are 
empty and their doors yawn in abandoned blackness that hints at 
the deeper darkness within. The area is devoid of any organic 
matter. A single iron brazier hangs from the ceiling at one end 
of this section of road.

A Curve In The Cobbled Lane~
   Curving northward and extending eastward, this cavernous 
tunnel turns abruptly to form an elbow corner. The curving 
ceiling stretches high overhead, the floor flat and even with a 
wide cobbled lane running down its center. On either side of the 
street several two storied building have been built. They look 
to have once served a dual purpose with second story apartments 
for those that ran the first floor shops. Everything that 
remains is carved from the same stone that defines the cavern 
rendering a monotonous quality to its already somewhat austere 
aesthetic. There are several balconies decorating the upper 
floors providing a good vantage of the street below.

A Broad Street Lined With Empty Structures~
   The road stretches east and west here, populated by stone 
buildings that look to have served a multitude of purposes. 
Their upper stories look suited to habitation while their single 
roomed wide windowed bottom floors look to have once been humble 
shops. The cobbled street could support a large amount of 
traffic and is lined on either side by a series of regularly 
spaced stone braziers. The ceiling arches high overhead. The 
efficiency of this area is timeless, the buildings looking to 
have been constructed of the same materials excavated from the 
stone that comprises the cavern.

A Massive Stone Atrium~
   This area is quite spacious, the cobbles leading into streets 
that begin at its eastern and western extremes. Almost perfectly 
square in construction its four corners are defined buy huge 
stone pillars that rise nearly four stories high where the lines 
are carried into an arching domed roof that comes to a distinct 
point at the center. The pillars look to have been carved from 
the stone of the cavern itself only half of their faces revealed 
while the remains bleed seamlessly into the walls. The floor of 
this area is fairly decorative with a simple circular design to 
their cobbles. Small and large stones are mixed together forming 
a geometric pattern. At its height, this wide space could have 
once housed hundreds. Abandoned, only echos seem to attempt to 
fill its depths.

A Cobbled Street Lined With Empty Buildings~
   Stretching in either direction in this long cavern a two 
tiered plateau that provides the foundation for the buildings 
that line the cobbled lane at its center. The buildings of the 
upper tier appear to have once served as simple residences while 
the bottom tier holds what look to have once been shop keeper's 
stalls. The lane is broad and could once have supported heavy 
foot and wheeled traffic. Their is no evidence of organic 
materials left here, only the stone walls of the buildings and 
their hints of past habitation.

A Sharp Turn In The Empty Cobbled Street~
   The road curves here sharply and forms a right angle to the 
west. The buildings that line the cobbled lane follow its bend. 
The buildings have open fronts that are divided by stone 
partitions into several stalls per building. In a single stone 
face the high arching ceiling rises gracefully overhead. From 
the stone braziers, stone walled buildings as well as the overall 
construction and excavation of the cavern to the subtle details 
of the area there is evident a masterful, if austere, knowledge 
of stone working.

A Long Abandoned Street Lined With Shops~
   A wide street stretches the length of this doomed cavern 
looking to have been hewn wholly from the stone bones of the 
mountain. A cobbled street looks to have been expertly laid and 
is lined on both sides by two story buildings. These buildings 
have large doorways in their fronts and empty window ledges that 
might be better suited to displaying what is inside than 
providing a view of the street below. The windows and doors all 
stand empty now, revealing only darkness within. Several of the 
buildings sport stone balconies overlooking the street.

A Cold And Lonely Street Far Underground~
   The ground here is flat in the center and takes the form of a 
broad cobbled thoroughfare. It angles up steeply to meet the 
doomed ceiling that arches high overhead and provides a slanted 
foundation for the squarish buildings that look to have served as 
shops and second story apartments to whatever once inhabited this 
area. The buildings themselves are constructed of stone slabs 
with complete outer walls and and large thick roofs. These 
considerations look to be concessions look to be born of a need 
for privacy and quiet as no environmental conditions change here 
deep under the mountain.

Large buildings, looking to have been constructed of the same 
material as the cavern, line the promenade. They are long 
abandoned and their blank windows and doors stare down at the 
street. The road is very broad and could have handled quite a 
bit of traffic. Several of the buildings have open fronts and 
provide stone stalls toward the street.

cavern lined on either side by large buildings. The buildings 
are often multi storied with empty windows and doors staring 
blankly down on the now abandoned street. At regular intervals

   Here, a long corridor begins, passing through the stone a far 
distance as it travels away from the ancient doors of stone that 
lie to the south of this place. Given great care in its 
crafting, this corridor has obviously once held a grandeur that 
has now been lost to ill-repair from its many long years of being

the darkness and the dust, populated only by this pair.

the set of double stone doors to the base of an ancient throne 
that has been left unfilled filled by anyone save the dust that 
has now gathered upon this deserted kingdom. Carved of stone, 
the throne is a mammoth construction that would seat one and it 
has been positioned that it may look out over all this room that 
now lies in a deep night. Once given elaborate decoration and 
floored by a cobble path, this chamber appears to have possessed 
an air of majesty, but now, this room is a mere silohouette of 
the grandeur that once existed in this world below the mountain.

   Approximately the size of a human fist, the floor here is flat 
and even, the cracks between the cobbles filled with rockdust. 
The air hangs heavy with moisture and the smell of molds and 
other fungus in the area. Spanning the walls from floor to 
ceiling are a few stout pillars which support the weight of the 
ceiling in this area. Great grey bricks have been well placed 
here, rendering the walls and ceiling uniform planes.

Dusty Old Room~
   Spaced evenly apart and spanning the ceiling are a seiries of 
pillars and joists. Heavy stone, grey in color, has been used to 
create the large stones that make up the walls and ceiling. 
Instead of mortar grit and stone dust fill the small cracks 
between the cobbles that make up the floor here. Spreading 
across the floor and creeping up the walls in the corners fungus 
grows largely unchecked.

A Large Highway Passing Through the Grey Stone~
   Leading through the grey stone, this great highway passes 
through the stifling darkness along a straight course. Wide 
enough to allow for a great flow of traffic, this road seems to 
have gone disused for a long time; yet, despite the lack of 
maintenance or care it seems to be a smooth, unmarred course.

Along an Ancient Highway of Great Berth~
   Wide and spacious, this great highway was etched from the 
stone of the mountain's belly in an age long gone by. Despite 
being an aged path, this road maintains its integrity and allows 
for easy travel through the subterranean world. This road would 
quite easily support a heavy flow of traffic as it is at least 
six carts wide.

A Wide Highway Leading North Through Grey Stone~
   Spanning a wide distance, this ancient road passes through the 
grey stone along a straight northward course. The floor of this 
road has been cobbled, and now bears upon its face several 
potholes that mar what once would have been an excellent roadway. 
The size of this path is truly immense as it stands to have a 
width of at least six carts.

A Great Highway Turns South and East~
   Turning from south to east, this grand path shifts its 
direction in a seamless ninety degree twist. The ancient cobbled 
road, despite the occasional pothole, provides a well-kept path 
despite the fact that it now lies in a state of perpetual disuse. 
The archaic highway is of a great width, but as it turns to move 
eastward, some of the massive size is trimmed down as the walls 
of grey stone close to shrink the width of this cobbled passage.

from west to east; a slight sloping upward occurring as one moves 
to the east from here. The cobbled stone that runs under foot, 
now covered in a thick layer of dust, seems much unblemished 
despite the fact that it has now gone years without repair or 
maintenance. The abandoned course is worn, bearing the evidence 
of once having supported a routine flow of traffic, but this ramp 
now lies in the blackness, undisturbed and unused.

left here to itself for many lengthy years. The cobbled path 
that precedes through here bears a fine coat of dust that has

with only the rusted ancient lampposts to keep it company.

city streets bisect here to form a large intersection. The roads 
here are cobbled and once would have made an excellent place for 
travel. These days, they are simply abandoned and left forgotten 
within the darkness of the subterranean city. No life may be 
spied here; the gathering of dust and decaying buildings of this

that are of a great size. These doors lie embedded within a wall 
of stone. The row of houses that border this street to either 
the north or south come to butt up against the stone which the 
doors are fixed into. The ancient street lamps, rusted and 
corroded, continue to the doors before two final lampposts, 
grander in size than their predecessors rise up before the doors.

many years since this place has seen any light or even had anyone

tunnel is formed of rough stone, with jagged sections abundant 
making the walls rough and coarse to the touch. Underfoot, the 
stone of the floor is smooth, and well-worked, making it 
completely flat and steady. A broad, thick stone door is set in 
the western wall, mounted on crude hinges of black iron. In the 
northern and southern walls, two crudely hacked tunnels lead into 
the walls of the fortress itself.

A Wide, Open Courtyard~
   Smooth slabs of stone make up the ground of this broad 
courtyard, while the walls surrounding it are crude, 
roughly-hacked blocks of rock, set into position in a haphazard 
manner. Barely visible on the rock walls are a series of 
countless thin slits, only just wide enough to see through from 
any distance. The walls on all sides are high and hold 
battlements overhead, while on both west and eastern wall is 
affixed a sizeable iron portcullis, with a pair of chains affixed 
to each leading high up the battlements to raise and lower the 
things.

A Cramped Stone Tunnel~
   Craggy stone walls make up this slender passageway, to its 
north and southern sides. Rough shards of rock and debris are 
also scattered about the smooth stone floor, as well as set into 
the walls themselves making them sharp to the touch. A small 
doorway is set into the southern wall, while the eastern egress

A Tapering Stone Cave~
   This cavern grows wider to the eastern side, before 
culminating in a solid stone wall. The northern stone is rough 
and abrasive to the touch, while the southern is of more skilled

slits, just wide enough to shoot through, along with a few higher 
gaps in the stone through which to see. The only way out of the 
cavern is to the slender passage westward.

   This narrow passage of rough stone is craggy and loose, with 
small rocks scattered about the floor. The floor itself is 
formed of well-made slabs of smooth stone, a stark contrast to

A Stepped Stone Face~
   A series of stone steps makes up the western wall of a

and lead down to the smoother stone of the Great Hall to the 
west, and up to a visible set of battlements further upwards and 
to the east. The stone is roughly carved and steep, but very 
solidly put together, set in place firmly and securely.

from blocks of stone. It is evident that a few of the 
battlements here have been incorrectly built, and are 
significantly smaller than the others, as well as having a 
circular shape. The entire floor is slightly tilted down towards 
the courtyard to the south-east. A stone face is visible to the

Battlements over a Deep Chasm~
   The building upon which this set of battlements has been built 
comes to a quick end here, where a deep chasm cuts through the 
cavern and continues far into the distance north and south. On 
the other side of the walls lies a wide courtyard, expanding out 
to the south-west. Both building and battlements are formed of 
roughly-cut, coarse slabs of rock.

Battlements over a Wide Iron Portcullis~
   The battlements are interrupted here to make room for a rough 
groove in the stone, supporting an enormous portcullis made of 
black iron. Upon the top of the building is a large, crude 
winch, which is affixed to the portcullis by a pair of thick iron 
chains. The building runs parallel to the vast chasm immediately 
to its eastern side, which is spanned by a grand bridge just east 
of the battlements here. The battlements form a ledge over this 
bridge, making it possible to shoot a bow down onto it.

portcullises and the walls atop which the battlements are

and any manner of tool, raw resource, or armor and weaponry. A 
few nests litter the scattered corners of the enclosure, though 
none come too close to one another, and each seems to house 
several trophies of past kills or conquests. The rough-hewn 
walls offer dull surfaces for faint torch light to expose, and 
the heavy logs of the roofing gives the scent of sap and wood. 
Heavily armored yrkish figures stomp through the enclosure fairly 
regularly, passing along information or receiving orders.

   A thick layer of dust covers this shaft, several inches deep 
upon upturned surfaces, such as the long series of thick, iron 
pegs set into the western wall. These pegs are placed at regular 
intervals, in pairs, forming a neat track up the decrepit wall. 
Loose rocks and rubble are upon the rest of the shaft's walls, 
which can be easily knocked loose, and many such stones litter 
the floor of the shaft. The pegs meet the ground, which has been 
smoothed to be level, and a flat space of open cavern unfolds to 
the western side of the shaft.

A Massive Expanse of Green~
   This massive cave is entirely covered with a thick, hairy coat 
of a viridian-green moss. From the floor, to the walls, to the 
ceiling, the place is coated entirely. The walls are smooth to 
the touch, coated as they are, and slender white spore-heads poke 
up from the mossy surface, ready to release the dust within them. 
Several large mushrooms grow above this moss in clusters, and the 
cavern floor is warm under bare feet. 
   During the day-time, a crack of light shines through from a 
tiny sliver of missing rock in the ceiling high overhead.

look to be holding the slabs to the wall loosely. The slabs 
themselves are several feet long, and intricately carved with 
detailed images. Five of them make up the height of the room, 
while long sections on the western wall go unused, revealing 
hollow lengths behind, several inches deep.

columns engraved with merry carvings - flowers, sparkling gems,
barrels of ale, miniature bearded figures in triumphant and
gleeful poses. In the center of the smooth floor is a ring of
alternating silver and gold-colored tiles, that ring itself
ringed by small stone thrones now in ruined heaps. This room was
used for some ceremonial purpose, and was clearly the host of
many happy times in gladder days. No longer. Now the tiled floor
holds only piled junk and a powerful reek.

   The most striking feature of this room is a flight of stone 
steps leading upwards in a tight spiral. Each step is small in 
height, and skillfully crafted, each one a perfect right-angle. 
Just to the side of this flight of stairs is a large hole in the 
ground, clearly hacked crudely from it and much less smoothed 
than the opposite direction. Several stone ledges lead the way 
down it, then a series of steps can be seen leading down into the 
depths. The room extends westwards from these objects to a white 
stone door, and is filled otherwise with orkish nests.

   This small cavern breaks away from a claustrophic tunnel 
branching here from the south. The tight walls of the enclave 
trap the humidity chokingly and are formed of jagged rock; they 
appear more naturally made than hewn by craft. Along the full 
length of the eastern wall is a trench, perhaps three feet wide; 
small waves of black water lap up against the stone, hinting that 
there is more than just a trench-worth of water beneath that 
steamy, sunken blanket.

   Here, beneath the steaming surface of the water, the turn in 
the path is so tight that would be dangerous for more than two to 
attempt the swim at once lest they be trapped. Indeed, part of 
the danger is caused a litter of ancient skeletons and bones that 
slide haphazardly along the tunnel floor with the slow tide. 
Even the sharp edges of the walls prove to be threatening, 
jutting in each direction like dozens of monstrous teeth, some of 
them with the skulls of unfortunates crowning their points. 
Still, the way continues eastward despite the natural and 
unnatural obstructions that narrow the tunnel.

A Narrow, Sunken Tunnel~
   The sunken tunnel remains narrow here, as it bores its way 
deeper into Moria. Stalagtites and stalagmites reach for the 
center of the underpass threateningly, though the way is 
otherwise straight and without turns. Westward, the tunnel 
ascends and the tide of the water seems to push mostly that way; 
and eastward, the tunnel descends, the way made more difficult by 
the resistance of the current, but not unbearably so. Just 
before a sharper plunge into the waters is a crack in the roof, 
large enough to show that whatever lies above may very well be 
what has flooded the tunnel.

Deeper into the Sunken Abyss~
   The water is warm here, and calm. This area of the tunnel is 
still narrow, though the walls are smooth for the most part. 
There is still a carpet of bones forgotton on the rock-bed here, 
despite the almost transient feeling of the abyss. To the west, 
the sunken tunnel ascends through the mountain. The more 
challenging trail is eastwards; it, too, climbs upward. Infact, 
through the black waters there appears to be a glowing light 
above the surface that way; however, the way eastward is so 
narrow and jagged that it would take more of a feat of climbing 
than swimming, and there is the threat of being trapped here, in 
the deepest part of the waters.

A Steamy, Glowing Cave Grotto~
   Unlike much of Moria, this cave is not enveloped in eternal 
darkness. Here, the pale green, glowing light of many different 
plants, molds and insects reflects off of the smoky blanket of 
the steamy air. In truth, the affect of the prism glow is almost 
surrealistic. Hot steam rises from a pool of black water on the 
western side of the cavern, but is less prominent than the 
abundance of odd plant-life in this grotto, deep within Moria. 
The patches of small plants and molds look unique and rare, most 
of them soggy and weighed down by the humidity of this place. 
The hidden place is quite spacious and the rocky walls are rough 
only because of the living greenery that covers them.

A Mountain Trail, Coated in Ice~
   A thick coating of ice upon the rocks of this mountainous 
trail glows white where light touches it. The only pause in this 
ridged sheet is in those places coated by snow, laid down in 
thick, rarely perturbed sections atop the mountains. The trail 
winds and meanders, tricky to walk and uninhabited by wildlife.

An Offshoot of a Gathering Place~
   A slender cavern winds around through the rock, fairly small 
and fairly cramped. Despite this, the place is busy, orcs with 
carts frequently travelling to and fro across the bumpy stone 
floor, bearing goods. The cavern itself is roughly carved and 
well-worn, while the walls are slightly curved outwards.

The End of an Offshoot Cavern~
   This passage within the rock ends abruptly here, clear holes 
in the back end of the cavern where picks have gouged rock from 
it. This fits with the general craft of the rock walls, which 
are damaged and carved with marks from a pick. The floor is well 
weathered, crushed flat and badly scuffed. Plenty of orcs move 
to and fro within the cave, many bearing carts.

A Large Cave Dominated by a Stone Platform~
   Twisting, stone-etched pillars that have been crudely hacked 
from the stone stand in the corners either side of the equally 
crude stone platform that dominates the center of this expansive 
cave. Foul, unrecognizable liquids have pooled around the edges 
of this room where, in a strikingly ominous pose, a looming 
statue of a great serpent has been erected. Most notable about 
the statue are it's magnificent red ruby eyes. If one were to 
examine the area closer they would notice countless etchings in 
the walls depicting serpents of all sizes in all manners of 
unsavory and violent activities. In the southern end of the cave 
there is a small rift leading back out into a tunnel.

A Gradually Narrowing Tunnel that Terminates With an Imposing Wall~
   As one travels further north, the tunnel grows smaller until 
it is man-high and a couple of yards in width. An imposing wall 
rises to greet any traveler at the very end of the passage. A 
rift, capable of bearing a few people in its opening, splits the 
wall. Unlike the rocky walls that dominate the sides of this 
tunnel, this one has been carved with great care. It is free of 
the crags and rents that mar the other walls.

A Crude and Narrow Tunnel~
   Crude, narrow and entirely functional in its nature, this 
dimly lit tunnel cuts through the rock toward the north with 
little aesthetic aspirations. Not only are it's walls jagged 
with considerably sized chunks of sharp rock occasionally jutting 
out dangerously, but it's floor is uneven too, with those unlucky 
enough to trek this path being forced to tread carefully due to 
the unstable footing. In the southern end of the tunnel there is 
a gap that leads out into a large cave should it not be blocked 
off. Destined for the east, the tunnel stretches for as far as 
the eye can see.

An Enormous Cavern~
   This section of cave is simply huge. Sprawling out for a vast 
distance, it appears to be a natural formation, long spikes of 
rock emerging from its ceiling in a style difficult to achieve 
with a pick. The cave extends a long way in all directions, but 
continues furthest west and east. There are few features upon 
the bare rock aside from a ground floor, indicating heavy passage 
for some considerable length of time.

A Landing Above a Large Hole~
   The ground here is rocky and rough, covered in loose scree 
where the roof has fallen down to form this landing. The area is 
coated in a thin layer of fine dust, and angular stones are 
scattered about to make any fall a particularly troublesome one. 
High overhead is a wide hole, leading upwards to some cave a long 
way up, difficult to discern from this location.

A Heavily Used Nesting Area~
   Hundreds of rags are scattered about the continuation of this 
vast cavern, clearly in use for some period of time as a nesting 
area for many creatures. Scraps of rotted meat litter the floor, 
and grimy scraps of fabric coat the stone underfoot, while a 
massive debris pile near the northern end of the cavern holds 
rented scraps of leather as well as other assorted detritus. The 
vast cave continues east and west. To the south the nesting area 
continues.

A Sudden Dead-End, Completely Blocked by Rubble~
   The vast cavern running west and east gives way rapidly here, 
coming to what appears to be an enormous cave-in. Hundreds and 
hundreds of large boulders are crushed into a tight, compact mass 
to the east, with no obvious cause. The firm natural walls upon 
the northern and southern sides of this cavern run parallel past 
the cave-in, just about visible through what few cracks are in 
the rubble wall.

   As one progresses further north through this cave a pungent 
smell becomes stronger and stronger. Toward the south, where it 
meets an enormous cavern, the rocky ground is elevated and rather 
unnoteworthy. However, further to the north piles of orkish 
waste, rotting food, skittering insects and other foul substances 
of unclear origin become more and more regular until the cranny 
ultimately terminates with a bubbling, putrid cesspool.

A compact cave with shelving hacked into its walls.~
   Kept rather clean in comparison to the living quarters to the 
west, this cave is much smaller and compact and has likely been 
dug from the rock-face for means of storage. Four permanent 
shelves have been hacked into existence all along the caves 
walls, the highest shelf requiring most orkin to stand upon a 
crate or chest to reach it. The rather smooth floor is marred by 
scratching and dents, undoubtedly a result of some heavy loads 
having been drug across its surface in times past.

A Cave, Crudely Made~
   This small cave was dug in from the western wall of the cave 
kitchen. The ceiling is rather low, making it only suitable for 
orcs of smaller caliber to circulate correctly without hitting 
their heads. On the walls, crude marks made from inexperienced 
hands with picks can be denoted. Some drawings made with perhaps 
burnt wood ornate the three walls. The ground seems a bit uneven 
but is barely noticeable as a huge nest is laid in the middle of 
the cave, taking most of the space as well as supplies for the 
kitchen. The heat from the fire-pit in the next room can be felt 
in this cave, removing the humidity and the smell of mold.
