Atop a Cluster of Rubble~
   The skeletal remains of the once-great Bele-Iant are scattered 
about this section of the river, jutting upwards and holding 
remnants of the once-great structure. This specific, precarious 
little isle is the creation of some of those still-risen support 
columns with other bits of debris clustered around their bases. 
Wood, moss, and mud have all stuck together between two of these 
large stone columns, the result being a rather ill-fated island. 
The ground, where one to step on it, gives lightly and too much 
weight would send the owner's foot shearing through and into the 
water below. To both the east and the west, remains of the 
bridge can be seen, as well as their respective shores.

At the Base of a Large Cliff~
   The ruins of the once-grand Bele-Iant bridge lay to the north, 
while this small section of river-bank is quasi-solid. The 
ground beneath is mud and would stick heavily to the feet of any 
trespassers, making progress through here an arduous affair. The 
western wall of the cliff seems to be jagged enough that, 
perhaps, one could manage to climb upwards. To the east, north, 
and south, the River Anduin stretches on.
