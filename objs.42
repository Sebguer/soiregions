a dried-out child corpse~
An ominous dried-out corpse of a child wrapped in leather lies here.~
   This small body is tightly wrapped up in thick and wide straps 
of leather, which drenched in some foul-smelling fat-based 
ointment, have mostly rotted away. The corpse itself is of the 
size to be an eight-year old child, shriveled and bent, almost 
mummified with rotting yellowish skin stretched over brittle old 
bones. Odd marks and symbols have been cut into the childs skin 
and the leather wrappings, almost made invisible from decay. It 
rests a boding feeling over the long-dead thing, almost like an 
intangible shadow.

tied by three leather strings to allow it to be worn around the 
neck. It is set with a tuft of small black feathers, and its 
bony surface is very crudely cut with brashly carved runes and 
scrawl; almost as though they were etched in some great haste at 
the time of its making. It is a grim trinket, to be certain, and 
worn greatly by the hand of time.

A elven stone guardian stands here as a silent warning.~
   Calm though stern, this guardian gazes forever toward the 
horizon. No chisel mark, seam or other blemish give hint as to 
whether this statue was crafted by hand or if it has stood 
sentinel here since the beginning of time. Almond eyes, long 
back swept hair, pointed ears and slender build mark the race of 
this elven champion. Though formed of unyielding stone the 
woodland garb that details him look to be able to sway with any 
breeze. With one hand resting on his heart, his other extended 
low near his waistline to hold palm outward, he warns all that 
passage is not permitted.

survived here for many, many years. They are of various shapes,

within them the secrets of ages past.

mounds to seek fortune and lore. Remember to roleplay

parchment and bound in stiff yellowish skin that from closer 
examination very well be human. The whole item seems damp and 
damaged by water and time, its covering flaking away and pieces 
of pages torn or fallen out. Its front is marked with a large 
and swirling circular symbol that in itself reassembles a fall 
into a bottomless pit, where staring too long can be 
uncomfortable. Further vague and only partly readable signs and 
symbols are burnt into the skin almost in a random manner. A 
thin silver chain ending in a tiny skull pendulum is attached to 
the back in order to be used as a bookmark.

mound, a sturdy longhouse is provided a panoramic view of the 
surrounding land. A steeply angled thatch roof descends from its 
peak to overhanging eaves used to protect supplies from the 
elements. The long walls are made of enormous, untreated logs. 
Hay and mud fill in any gaps, providing protection to those 
within from the harsh winter wind. Facing south, a small, 
terraced platform of even stones sits at the foot of a pair of 
large doors that have been overlaid with ancient hides. Along 
the peak of the roof are a series of wooden ornamentations 
curving like fangs toward the sky.

   Collected from the surrounding forest, this long house is 
constructed from fire hardened logs. The rounded walls of the 
steeply peaked roof is a bristly mass of weathered wooden 
shingles. Adorning the boarders of the exterior walls standing 
in contrast to the dull black walls are ropes woven into complex 
knot work designs. This artistry is repeated in the massive 
single slab, south facing, front door. Recessed into the large 
door, taking up less than half the expanse, is a smaller door 
large enough to admit a single human being. At either end of the 
peaked roof are wooden chimneys. A plaque above the entrance 
bears the symbol of two crossed mining picks.

filthy stain and the last looks to have been ruined by submersion 
in some liquid. This strip looks long enough to be worn as a

tarnished old key Moria METAL~
a tarnished, old key~
An old key of tarnished metal lies upon the ground.~
   Tarnished and bearing many small nicks, this key shows signs
of being of a great age. In addition to its age, the crafting of
this key seems to have been hasty, giving little care to more 
than serving the function of opening a single, specific door.

A large low stone bar sits here, unchanged by time.~
   A single slab of dark grey stone, shot through with white 
veins of white, looks to have once served as a bar. Jade and 
obsidian shards have been inlaid to cover its front forming a 
mosaic of swirling colors. The bar itself sits low to the ground 
and has a broadened base, perhaps at one time serving as a 
footrest.

A low stone stool rests here, immobile.~
   Apparently with little attention paid to comfort the stool 
before you is a simple squat cylinder barely reaching to the 
knees of a grown human. The top bears the merest depression 
where it might contour to the buttocks. From its position in the 
room it seems to have served as a stool. The weight of this 
piece of furniture makes it very difficult to even move, let 
alone lift.

   This long table once rested on two braces set at either end. 
Intricate detailing has been etched into its border. It is 
cracked roughly across the center at its weakest point as if a 
too great a weight once rested there. There is no evidence as to 
what might have broken this once elegant if sturdy piece of 
furniture.

A row of casks of enormous dimensions dominates the eastern wall.~
   Sitting on their sides, each face pierced by a marble spigot, 
six enormous hardwood casks face the center of the room. They 
reach from floor to ceiling, taller than the height of a grown 
man and twice as long. They are united on a marble base that 
holds them equidistant from each other. Green verdigris rings, 
more than a hand span wide, evidence the bronze banding that once 
held the wooden planking in place. The craftsmanship of the cask 
has apparently preserved it far beyond its intended usage.

   The remnants of what look to have been shelves have collapsed 
here, broken and punky with dry rot. Buried within the depths of

tankards. The shelves appear to have been vast, perhaps covering 
an entire wall, though now they are nothing but splintered hints 
as to their long ago purpose.

a black longbow with metal-capped tips~
A black longbow is here, its tips a dully gleaming metal.~
   This remarkably sturdy longbow has been carved from a block of 
ash, then carelessly blackened by fire, just enough for the color 
to change. This longbow would measure to the size of an average 
man, its plain metal tips adding to its length in total. Upon 
closer inspection of the bowshaft, one would note an attempt at 
engraving, though it went horribly wrong, the worker having not 
even bothered finishing. Its middle is wrapped in greasy 
leather, enough for a hand to take a firm grip when in use.

   A thick, rigid hardwood shaft has been sanded smooth and 
affixed with a broad iron spearhead. The blade is relatively 
sharp, forged of dark iron and beaten into a crude triangle with 
two barbed prongs. The shaft is some seven foot long and left 
untreated, leather wrapped around it in two places to assist the 
hands. Though quite heavy, the spear could inflict great damage 
if wielded with strength, especially from the back of a mount.

   Dark iron has been beaten into a crude sword, forged by an 
orkish craftsman with more regard for efficiency than beauty. 
The blade is completely straight, well-sharpened along the outer 
edge, and the tip cuts off at a right angle with a spike swept 
back toward the wielder. No crossguard protects the hand and the 
entire sword is forged in one piece, hilt included. Coarse 
leather cord has been wound around it for a safer grip.

A heavy, broad-bladed bastard sword with a stone pommel is on the ground here.~
   A copious amount of iron has been forged into a long, hefty 
sword by an orkish weaponsmith, crude and brutal in appearance. 
The blade is thick and broad, heavy enough on its own to deal 
great damage, and both edges are keenly sharpened. Hammer-marks 
are visible along the middle of the sword and it is without 
fuller, adding to the weight of the weapon. A wide, square 
bronze crossguard protects the wielder, each quillon jutting at a 
rigth angle from the foot of the blade. The cord-wrapped hilt is 
long and sturdy, easily allowing double-handed use while wearing 
gauntlets. A large, triangular stone pommel, chipped into the 
rough shape of a warg's head, gives the weighty weapon balance.

   The thick hide of a boar has been sewn into this pair of short 
legwear. The coarse, bristly hair of the beast still remains on 
the outside of the garment, lending it an unpleasant feel, but 
the hide is thick enough to offer protection against harsh 
weather or even weapons. Though stiff, the breeches are somewhat 
roomy, and they end just below the knee where frayed laces allow 
them to be fastened to a pair of tall boots.

it to be looped through a piercing in the nose's cartilage, 
though jewelry of this size is rarely fashionable among humans.

A pair of dilapidated, iron chainmail leggings have been discarded here.~
   These aged pair of chain mail leggings have been woven 
together with hundreds of small iron rings. Despite their fine 
make, time has taken their toll on this armor; the layers of iron 
chain corroding away slowly, leaving thin patches of rusty rings 
in some spots, while in other places there are outright holes in 
the chain. Held in place by the connection of rusty rings, 
sheets of iron plate have been attached to the thigh and 
kneecaps. Mimicking the other chain, these plates have too, 
become worn and rusty.

A pair of dilapidated, iron chainmail sleeves have been discarded here.~
   Hundreds of rusty iron rings comprise these worn-down pieces 
of armor. Through use and poor care over what appears to be a 
long period of time, the chain has become thin and patchy in most 
places. Where the chain isn't at its thinnest, a number of rents 
and holes further run across the length of the rusty armor. On 
top of the chain, thin iron plates are held in place at the 
upper-arms and the elbows to provide a second layer of protection 
to the wearer, although they are nearly futile in purpose now. 
These plates, like the chain, have become significantly less 
protective over time, their metal rusty and chipped away around 
the edges.

A dilapidated chain mail vest has been discarded here.~
   Rusted and well-worn, this piece of armor has become far less 
useless due to the patchy, rusted chain mail that comprises this 
piece. The vest falls down to just below the wearer's waist and 
extends upward far enough to provide enough slack to cover the 
lower neck. Across the chest, and at the shoulder, thin sheets 
of iron have been stitched in place to offer further protection. 
However, after years of decaying, the stitching has become far 
looser, causing the plates to jostle around when the wearer of 
this armor is set into movement.

a heavy, segmented iron cuirass~
A heavy, segmented iron cuirass sits upturned here.~
   This rather crudely piece of armor is as simple as reasonable 
protection can get. Two simple plates of iron have been quickly 
forged in a novice manner; the iron brittle in most places, while 
visible slag covers the thicker parts of the metal. The two 
plates have been connected together via a series of rusty chains 
which run through the shoulders, while a separate set run around 
the sides of the plate. This simple system allows the plates to 
be tightened to the wearer's form. Additionally, battered iron 
pauldrons have been connected to the upper pair of chains to 
offer simple protection to the shoulders. Although the shoddy 
iron covers the chest, back, and shoulders aptly, the right and 
left side of the wearer are left revealed by a gap in the iron 
plates.

   This crude piece of animal hide has been quickly cut apart and 
stitched together into the shape of a vest. As a result of it's 
hasty make, many of the threads have come loose, signs that this 
vest is on the way to becoming near useless, even as an article 
of clothing. The cracking hide still has wispy tufts of white 
goat hair to the vest, though in most other places, the bare 
cracking hide overpowers the color of the goat hair.

thin tufts of goat hair hang in sporadic patterns. In addition 
to the sickening odor that rises from the armor, the hides make 
an annoying creaking noise as the wearer walks around.

A heavy, slag-ridden falchion has been set here.~
   This broad iron blade curves upward from its bone hilt, the 
end of the blade also flourishing outward. The hilt is also a 
yellow bone of some humanoid, yellowed form wrapped up in greasy, 
animal hide to provide a somewhat better grip. Through a hasty 
forging process, the chipped iron blade has been covered with 
rocky slag. While the slag certainly gives the weapon the 
ability to chop down significantly harder, it also makes the 
durability of the blade far worse, going as far to say that it 
could potentially break against a solid enough opponent.

splintered away in most places, where there aren't the large 
knots which clearly hinders the grip upon the weapon. The blade 
of the spear has been sharpened to a wicked point, ensuring 
significant wounds if the iron was able to connect to it's 
destination. The blade is simply attached the wooden shaft by 
winding lengths of sinew.

of this hunk of shaped iron have been cut into a wicked 
serration, the cruel points running from its tip all the way down

hilt is formed into a crude rectangualr prism and wrapped with 
dark leather. A heavy iron pommel is fitted to the end of this 
weapon, balancing the tool made specifically for murder.

a large raw grey lizardskin~
A large raw grey lizardskin has been left here.~
   This mammoth skin is grey in color, pebbly to the touch, and 
looks to have been freshly torn from whatever it once adorned. 
It is extremely large, only manageable when rolled up on itself. 
Fatty white flesh still hangs from its underside while the 
obvious outer side maintains its rough texture and hard plates.

A small, worn key lies upon the ground, forgotten.~
   Showing the tell-tale signs of being used for many seasons, 
this key possesses the evidence of being worn upon heavily and 
formed to be purely functional. The key is made of brass, now 
tarnished from its many years of use.

A set of grey lizard skin sleeves has been left here.~
   One sleeve of this set looks to be more sturdily made than the 
other. The shoulder of the dominant sleeve sports a thick 
paldron of lizard skin reinforced with a hand full of fangs. The 
elbow of the same sleeve is covered by a elbow panel of similar 
design. The lighter sleeve has been constructed of the same 
leather material as the under layer of its more developed mate. 
The smaller sleeve looks to have been designed to work best with 
a shield.

leggings. The thigh and shin panels have been reinforced with 
dark gray green scaled pieces of double ply lizard skin. The 
scales of these pieces are grainy and extremely small and look to 
offer a great deal of protection. Bone stays run down the shins 
further reinforcing the front.

The grey lizard skin is covered in tiny dense scales and look to 
have a gravelly texture.

   This gorget is comprised of a standard under layer of normal 
leather that serves as a base for a series of lizard skin panels 
that hang like shingles to protect the wearer's neck. The piece 
stitches together in the back and hangs from the top of the neck 
to splay over the shoulders, back and chest to some degree. 
While the piece looks mildly constraining the protection it 
offers makes it more than admirable as a garment.

with some degree of protection. Panels hang from the temples and 
hang jointed to cover the cheeks. A light mask hangs down from 
the forehead and provides eye slits for the wearer as well as a 
sturdy bone nose guard that looks to be fastened to the framework 
that provides the support for the piece. The hide that the helm 
is made of is of a thick grey lizard skin comprised of tiny 
pebbly scales. A stripe of fangs run from the front of the head 
and down the back in a single line.

   This shield is no larger than a foot and a half in diameter. 
To large to be considered a buckler it looks to have been 
designed for a smaller wearer. The back panel is a series of 
radiating rib bones of some large beast with leather ties to 
affix it to the wearer's arm. The front of the shield is a 
strange scaled grey hide that has been stretched tightly across 
its front. The edge of the shield is covered in animal fangs 
that point outward toward any opponent and look to be designed to 
discourage grappling attacks.

grey lizard skin. Spikes in the form of fangs sprout from the 
toes and heel of the wearer. The soles are flat and made of a 
dissimilar material that conforms more readily to the ground than 
the pebbly grey scales of the upper lizard skin.

to a sheer filmy thinness that wraps the wearer in a second skin. 
It is designed to closely hug the head with loose ties hanging 
down at the temples, tying under the chin. A similar loose flap 
hangs down from the back of the head covering the neck and 
hanging between the shoulder blades.

its uneven edge. The gorget splays out over the shoulders and 
hangs loosely over the upper back and chest.

the seams of the fingers stitched tightly in small stitches. The 
articulation of the fingers and thumb appear to be the chief

minimal protection despite being long enough to cover a goodly

around the wearer's calves to the knee, several ties holding them 
in place. The feet are covered in little more than slippers.

   A diverse crowd sits around the room, all but one or two 
locals with their own seating place and their own friends close 
by. Some make their own food and bring it over to the tables, 
there are many hardy people here and normally a good mood lies as 
a warm cloak across the room.

#5A burly orc motions for other to 'travel north'.#0~
   This burly and unkempt orc has dark skin and a sallow face. 
Waving his arms and giving a loud call to any who come by, he 
motions for those present to 'travel north'. Often he gives a 
loud roar, intimidating orcs who dwaddle upon the path.

A metal key that has been bent out of shape lies here.~
   Far from functional, this key appears bent and twisted out of 
shape. Made of a soft metal, time and use have marked it

and a carving mounted above the doors display that of a pair of 
tankards, frothing over. Three windows accent each of the long 
sides, and a tree or two have been planted beside the building to

   This large guild house is composed of two stories. Fitted, 
wooden logs rise up high into the air and are topped by a peaked 
roof, the wooden construction seemingly newer in some places than 
others. The building itself is painted on all sides but the 
western wall has been painted a bright yellow in color, 
contrasting sharply with the white washed color that the rest of 
the house has been painted. Large, double doors are set right in 
the center of the guild house and are sectionalized into four 
squares upon which are carved the four symbols of Angost's 
guilds.

A fire-hardened longhouse bearing a stag carving has been built here.~
   Collected from the surrounding forest, this long house is 
constructed from fire hardened logs. The rounded walls of the 
steeply peaked roof is a bristly mass of weathered wooden 
shingles. Adorning the boarders of the exterior walls standing 
in contrast to the dull black walls are ropes woven into complex 
knot work designs. This artistry is repeated in the massive 
single slab, south facing, front door. Recessed into the large 
door, taking up less than half the expanse, is a smaller door 
large enough to admit a single human being. At either end of the 
peaked roof are wooden chimneys. A plaque above the entrance 
bears the symbol of a stag with broad antlers.

remarkably comfortable given its simple make, large enough to 
drape over the shoulders of even a large man.

primitive peaked roof made of wood has been erected over the 
well's circular opening, held up by four slender posts, roughly 
hewn from hardwood. Pieces of an older, ruined roof and sections 
of ruined foundation have been stacked around the well's base; 
positioned, most likely, to strengthen the well's worn 
foundation.

A straight, double-edged iron greatsword lies here.~
   The iron blade of this greatsword is straight, completely free 
from scratches or nicks. A unadorned, simple iron hilt stretches 
out only an inch on either side of the long, leather-wrapped grip 
which in turn ends with a solid, round iron pommel, also 
unadorned. Along the masterfully crafted blade rests a single 
line of beautifully etched script. The sword looks old, yet in 
perfect condition, dull iron gleaming when any light hits the 
blade.

   Patches of fabrics dyed dark greens and lighter browns have 
been stitched together to form this voluminous cloak, the piece 
easily enough to fully enclose one's body when the large hood is

quilt, each patch is of a slightly different colour, age and wear 
blending the dark shades in to a convincing verisimilitude of 
forested terrain at a distance.

some sort of humanoid, but others include enlarged fangs of 
various shapes and sizes, and lone claws and tusks.

a segmented, lustrous steel gorget~
A segmented, lustrous steel gorget lies here.~
   omposed of three segmented plates, this gorget is smithed of a 
lustrous, tempered steel alloy, unyielding in its strength yet 
surprisingly light. The first plate extends from the jawbone 
downwards, encircling the throat area. The second plate begins 
atop the midway point of the first and extends downwards to just 
touch the collarbone, providing a double layer of protection to 
the vulnerable throat area. The final plate begins just above 
the base of the second, spreading to cover the top of the 
breastbone and shoulders. The segmentation of the plates allows 
a full range of motion for the neck, each section moving 
seamlessly over the next without compromising their protective 
ability. When closed, the gorget appears seamless, yet the 
buckle on the right hand side of the bottom plate indicates its 
location. Engraved upon the left hand side of the gorget, at the 
base of the neck, is a lozenge containing a sunburst pattern, 
radiating six tongues of flame towards the edge of the lozenge, 
though only two points reach the border of the device.

cuirass UNIQUE_PBARATHEL exquisite fluted lustrous steel METAL~
an exquisite, fluted cuirass of lustrous steel~
An exquisite, fluted cuirass of lustrous steel lies here, gleaming brightly.~
   A masterwork of craftsmanship, this cuirass is composed of a 
sleek fitting breastplate and backplate, and is obviously fitted 
and formed for a singular wearer. Convex flutes bloom from the 
sides, expanding in enlarging, crescent like waves until they 
converge at the center line of the armour. Aside from their 
decorative purpose, the flutes serve to strengthen and stabilise 
the cuirass against all manner of blows and, combined with the 
unyielding resiliency of the tempered steel alloy it is smithed 
of, the armour provides a stalwart protection to the wearer. 
From the waist, the plate continues, flaring downwards in a 
fluted pattern to cover the abdomen and upper thighs, enfolding 
the entirety of the torso in the armour's protective embrace. 
The design of the cuirass disperses the weight of the armour 
evenly, which allows the wearer relative freedom of motion when 
compared to more cumbersome pieces. Highlighted upon the center 
of the breastplate, carving a break where the flutes meet, is a 
raised device of a lozenge holding a six pointed sunburst, with a 
tongue of flame touching the upper and lower corner of the 
emblem.

a pair of jointed, lustrous steel vambraces~
A pair of jointed, lustrous steel vambraces lies here.~
   Sized in perfect dimension for the wearer, these vambraces 
wrap the upper and fore arm in a sheath of solid metal, and serve 
as a testament to the skill of the smith. Beginning at the 
gently arched pauldrons, rounded, triangular flutes radiate 
downwards towards the elbow, ending just above the couter which 
caps the elbow itself. The flutes reinforce the strength of the 
tempered steel alloy, making the armour exceptionally resilient. 
The fluted, triangular pattern begins anew on the forearm, ending 
in a sharper point at the wrist of the tube. The elbow cup, 
composed of a trio of articulated plates, encircles the joint and 
moves and flexes seamlessly, allowing the upper and lower 
sections to pass in and out of it and giving the arm its full 
range of motion. Upon the upper, hindmost edge of the pauldrons 
on each arm is a small engraving, a lozenge shape that is filled 
with a six pointed flaring sunburst, the top and bottom point 
just touching the edge of the device.

a pair of articulated, lustrous steel greaves~
A pair of articulated, lustrous steel greaves lies here.~
   Extending from the top of the thighs to the ankles, these 
greaves wrap the legs of the wearer in seamless defence. A 
fluted pattern, intended to decorate and strengthen, flares from 
the top and knee of the greaves in a rounded triangular pattern, 
tips touching at the mid-thigh. The poleyn at the knee convexes 
outwards slightly, with a strong center line to deflect blows 
away from the joint, with one plate covering two smaller beneath. 
The triple plated, articulated construction of the poleyn allows 
the knee to flex and move, giving the leg remarkable ease of 
motion. The same fluted pattern is hammered into the durable, 
tempered steel alloy from the ankle upwards and knee downwards, 
meeting at the middle of the shin. Upon the top of each greave, 
on the inside of the thigh, a small insignia is engraved, a six 
pointed, flaring sunburst pattern inside a lozenge, the top and 
bottom tip meeting the corner of the bordering line.

a ruby-crowned, barbute helm~
A ruby-crowned barbute helm lies here.~
   Elegant and shapely, this barbute helm covers the entirety of 
the wearer's head and neck. The crown of the helm is slightly 
elevated from the skull and gently convexed to deflect and divert 
blows, instead of absorbing them directly, and is topped by a 
short, thin crest of metal that runs from the top of the forehead 
to the nape of the helmet. A thin stemmed Y shape is the only 
break in the protection of the helmet, cutting upwards and the 
arms flaring out in an oval around each eye, the shape allowing 
uncompromised vision and ease of speech and breath. Riveted 
together along its edge, the helm is composed of three layers of 
a durable, tempered steel alloy, unyielding and strong, and 
absorbs impact through a quilted, padded lining. Set securely 
above the nose guard, just above eye level, is a flawless, 
thumbnail sized ruby, cut into a multi-faceted lozenge shape, the 
only decorative feature to the otherwise undeniably purposeful 
and warlike helmet.

a lustrous, steel round shield bearing a sunburst emblem~
A lustrous steel round shield bearing a sunburst emblem lies here.~
   Graven boldly upon the face of this round shield is a diamond 
shaped lozenge, holding a fiery sunburst within its border. The 
device is six pointed, with the tip of the top and bottom ray 
touching the line of the lozenge, while the remaining four points 
do not reach the edge. Beyond this insignia, the face of the 
shield seems unblemished by dent or scratch and holds a soft 
lustre, as if it has never seen use in battle. Fastened to the 
forearm by a pair of straps, the shield measures perhaps two feet 
across and is perfectly round. Though the size of the shield may 
seem diminutive, its resilient, tempered steel alloy composition 
is extraordinarily light, allowing far greater agility for the 
wielder than a more cumbersome, larger shield would. Indeed, its 
lightness upon the arm in defence and attack likely makes up for 
its lack of coverage, though those with heavy feet would likely 
find it a poor choice of protection.

hammer EXPERT_QUALITY LOAD_N_I_KILL_U war UNIQUE_PBARATHEL balanced elegant METAL~
a balanced, elegant war hammer~
A balanced, elegant war hammer lies here.~
   Balanced and well proportioned, the form of this war hammer is 
graceful, yet this does nothing to camouflage its design as a 
devastating weapon of war. The head of the weapon is a cold, 
muted grey, forged of a hard, tempered steel alloy. The top of 
the weapon sports two differing sides with differing purposes. 
The flat face of the hammer is designed to deliver forceful 
concussive blows that can transmit impact through even the 
sturdiest plate armours, smashing bone and muscle beneath. A 
shallow, pyramid section has been removed from the center of the 
hammer face, leaving four jutting teeth, reducing the overall 
weight of the weapon while further concentrating the force of 
impact and reducing the chance of the hammer slipping, or the 
blow being diverted. The opposite face of the head is a thin, 
slightly downwards curving spike, forged in a diamond cross 
section. Tapering down to an acute point, this projection is 
used to pierce deeply into the chinks of armour, and the blow of 
a strong wielder can split maille and pierce plate. The head of 
the hammer is connected to the tempered steel shaft by means of 
peened rivets, while the shaft slots into the wooden handle with 
a full tang construction. Wrapped in fine wire for grip, the 
handle has a small, circular hand guard above it and a rounded 
pommel below it, which gives the weapon its exquisite balance. 
It is a quick, deadly weapon with which a skilled wielder could 
damage a foe in the hardiest armour.

ring UNIQUE_PBARATHEL delicate twining triad diamonds mithril METAL~
a delicate, twining ring adorned by a triad of diamonds~
A delicate, twining ring adorned by a triad of diamonds lies here, gleaming brightly.~
   Delicate and fine, the twin bands of this ring twine and curl 
about each other in a graceful dance. The dual strands form an 
unbroken circle that, when worn, rests at the base of the finger. 
The silvery sheen is unmarred by nick or scratch, even at the 
closest inspection. Indeed, the metal is uncharacteristically 
hard for silver and quite impossible to bend. Its luminous 
finish also surpasses silver by far for brightness and is without 
a hint of tarnish. Ensconced in filigree placements that cradle 
each securely is a trio of tiny, multi-faceted diamonds. Each 
has been cut with a master's care and precision, presenting a 
nearly uncountable number of faces to the world. When a ray of 
light hits these jewels directly it is immediately shattered into 
a sparkle of twinkling light and colour. And yet, when looked 
into directly, there seems to be a flicker of light within the 
gems themselves, as if alive with an inner radiance of their own.

pack travelling ELVISH_QUALITY wood-framed oiled leather LEATHER~
a wood-framed, oiled-leather travelling pack~
A wood-framed travelling pack of oiled leather lies here.~
   Composed of dark, well-tanned leather, this pack's 
construction is light and durable in all respects, made to 
withstand the rigors of extended wilderness travel while being as 
lightweight as possibe. Its entirety has been oiled through, 
making the leather highly resilient to the elements. Thick, well 
padded shoulder straps and a tongue of leather and a buckle to 
fasten it through at waist level help to evenly disperse the 
weight of the carried objects. Mounted to a framework of yew, 
the pack provides greater support and carrying capacity by 
attaching objects directly to the frame as well as in the pack 
itself. Horizontal braces at the shoulders and lower back 
reinforce the frame, making it very strong while keeping a low 
profile to avoid snagging on brush. Every stitch in the leather 
is tight and precise, and the construction of the frame is 
impeccable, making the pack a superbly crafted item.

an embossed, leather belt with an eagle feather buckle~
An embossed, leather belt with an eagle feather buckle lies here.~
   Supple and strong, the leather of this belt is finely tanned, 
retaining its flexibility and durability. A raised string of 
tooled circles lines the top and bottom edge of the belt, each 
concentric and evenly spaced. At intervals of one hand width are 
exquisitely detailed embossings of an eagle feather in smaller 
scale, the tip of the first facing away from the buckle and the 
next one facing the tip of the first, alternating in this pattern 
along the length of the belt. The beaten bronze buckle forms an 
eagle feather as well, the quillions raised slightly to provide 
depth to the image. The tongue of the belt slides behind the 
buckle to leave the image uncovered, a short peg on the back of 
the buckle fastening through the bronze riveted holes to secure 
it snugly.

shortbow ELVISH_QUALITY exquisitely-crafted recurved WOOD~
an exquisitely-crafted, recurved shortbow~
An exquisitely-crafted, recurved shortbow lies here.~
   A study in craftsmanship, this bow is of an unusual, yet 
remarkably effective, construction. Two seperate wood types, 
laminated together by a strong glue, form the stave, each 
selected for its particular properties. The inner section of the 
stave is composed of yew heartwood, while the outer face is 
composed of hickory, for their their compressive and tensile 
strengths, respectively. When unstrung, the tips of the bow 
curve away from the archer, which vastly increases the draw 
strength and gives the bow its recurve shape when strung. The 
cross-section of the bow is rectangular, and the faces of the bow 
are flat, to disperse the strain of firing evenly across the 
stave. In the centre of the stave is a leather wrapped handgrip, 
providing a secure grip for the wielder. A string of twisted 
linen fibres, treated with beeswax to water proof it, completes 
the bow. All together, the bow is a masterwork of craftsmanship, 
providing superior power and accuracy for its size while allowing 
ease of use.

a two-handed warspear with a tapered, leaf-shaped blade~
A two-handed warspear with a tapered, leaf-shaped blade lies here.~
   Taller than a man from tip to butt, this spear is a deadly, 
two-handed weapon. Composed of a light yet durable steel alloy, 
the blade bears the shape of a thin, elongated hastate leaf, 
curving gracefully up from its base, flaring in the middle and 
tapering back to its apex. The utmost tip of the blade is 
acutely pointed, easily able to slip the chinks in armour and 
split maille. The upward arcing bottom prongs of the leaf shape 
form the cross guard, the base of the long blade greeting the 
sturdy hickory shaft. Mid-way down the shaft is a leather 
wrapped area with a second farther towards the base, providing 
superior grip for the wielder. Directly beneath the blade, the 
wood is engraved with a swirling pattern of knot-like intertwined 
sworls which trace down to the first leather grip. The 
engravings are stained a rich gold colour, standing out as 
beautiful embellishment to the dark-red of the hickory wood 
shaft.

waraxe EXPERT_QUALITY ELVISH_QUALITY elegant wave crescent blade axe METAL~
an elegant waraxe with a wave-like, crescent blade~
An elegant waraxe with a wave-like, crescent blade lies here.~
   Though elegant, the sleek profile of this waraxe attests to 
its deadly intent. The silvery-steel blade takes the form of a 
thin crescent, thicker at the top, arcing outwards gracefully and 
curving back in. At the bottom, the blade curves outwards again 
subtly, the entire form reminiscent of a cresting wave. Attached 
to the richly stained, black walnut haft by means of a socketed 
head, the blade is keenly sharp and narrow, designed to 
concentrate force along a razor edge. Twin langets run down the 
outside of the haft until the midway point, protecting the wood 
from splitting and shearing by opposing weapons. Capping the 
haft's bottom is a steel spike, useful as a secondary piercing 
weapon at close quarters. Artful etchings of interlocking 
scrollwork grace the flat of the blade, giving this deadly weapon 
a unique sense of artistry.

A tall banner bearing the insignia of a white eagle lies on the ground.~
   This banner is attached to a six foot pole made of stout oak. 
At the top of the pole is an over-sized, shiny iron spearhead 
with several large, white feathers tied together to decorate 
below the joint of the spearhead. The banner itself is made of 
fine, dark brown cloth. Its color has faded slightly with age, 
but its material is without other wear and tear. The depiction 
of a great, white eagle takes up much of the center of the 
banner, and its form's quilted borders have been neatly stitched 
with vibrant golden-hued thread.

   This banner is attached to a seven foot pole made of fine 
rowan wood, which has been dyed a bright red. Tied to it is a 
large, broad banner made of snow-white cloth. The starkly 
contrasting color-quilted image of two solid red lances stretches 
nearly from corner to corner of the white cloth, with the lances 
crossing one another at the banner's center. Its very fine cloth 
material is well cared for, and its red and white colors are 
bright, unfaded, and emaculately kept.

in the back. A crude motif of the head of some sort of bird has 
been etched into the center of the shield, and the creature's 
eyes seem to stare aggressively outward.

with one paw lofted a bit into the air, head pointing down to the

sharp little muzzle flaring down to tiny nostrils. A dappling of 
dots decorates the spaces besides its jaw, where fine red hairs 
protrude as whiskers from the hardened clay. The coat upon it is 
etched with extremely tiny strokes that cover it from tip of nose 
to tip of tail. Should the sculpture be turned upside down, the 
detail on the paws would become visible, with the paw pads smooth 
and protruding.

pack travelling hipslung leather LEATHER~
a hipslung, leather travelling pack~
A hipslung, leather travelling pack lies here forgotten.~
   This travelling pack is very sturdy and well-tanned, the 
leather pliant but left its natural color. It is rectangular in 
shape, almost like a satchel, and many pockets have been sewn 
upon the inside and outside, allowing one to store many smaller 
things while leaving the main compartment of the pack to hold 
larger items. Rather than slinging across one's shoulders, a 
strap has been sewn through two loops in the back of the pack, 
easily adjusted in length by a bronze buckle to sling comfortably 
around one's waist. The strap can also be removed so as to slide 
the pack onto one's belt.

a heartstone-covered burrow~
A heartstone is here, barring entrance to an old, mountain-shaded burrow.~
   This large heartstone has been worn down by time and the 
elements, yet its foundation is sturdy enough to keep to its 
purpose. It lays back against the opening to a small burrow, and 
effectively keeps any intruders out of the hollowed burial place. 
On its age-smoothed surface is carved #2a set of old runes#0, 
keeping quiet monument for this resting place against the side of 
the mountain's looming rise.

A large stone marker looms here, depicting an old mural-etching.~
A large stone has been stood up on end, over a patch of rough
grass. A spiraling depiction of a man hunting a boar has been
carefully carved onto the surface, with runes interlaced into
the hunter's arm and spear. The etching itself has been dyed
a deep red, now pale with age.

#2The rune-carved mural#0 reads, in the northern-tengwar:

#3Hrofthen and Athylfird
#3Raised this stone in memory
#3Of Throngrim, their father.
#3With mighty bow did he hunt
In the Frozen Mountainwood,
To meet his end with spear in hand
Against a frightful boar
That he did dutifully slay
#3To feed his family.#0

   This hauberk is a heavy, rippling piece of fine armor. It 
consists out of thousands and thousands of small, dull iron 
rings. Each ring have been flattened before they have been 
interlinked and riveted together with tiny, iron wedges, to 
create a heavy mesh that offers superb protection. The hauberk 
covers the wearers back, chest, stomach and goes as far as to 
halfway down the thigh. The front, up until where one would wear 
a belt, has been split in two to provide ease of movement, both 
at the back and front. A simple but fine strip of thick cloth 
has been sewn onto the sleeveless edges and the lower part of the 
hauberk to close in the outmost rings and a brown leather 
triangle has been sewn onto the collar of the neck, pointing 
down.

However a small, round plate of dull iron has been fastened over 
the elbows to offer extra protection. The outer, only partially 
linked rings at the edge of the sleeves have been covered with a 
fine strip of green cloth.

unadorned strip of green cloth have been sewn along the edge to

undyed, but undoubtedly serviceable. A pair of thinner 
pauldrons, angular in shape, are bolted to the piece at either 
end to protect the shoulders of the wearer. Faulds fashioned of 
overlapping leather bands, attached to the lower edge of the 
cuirass by way of a number of dull metal rivets, are intended to 
guard the wearer's waist and hips. Save for a simple geometric 
design ringing the collar of the outfit, the armour is 
undecorated, and seems generally to be of a spartan, but sturdy 
make.

to rest on the shoulders and is then fastened at the sides with 
thick leather straps. It offers protection to the back and front 
of the wearer's upper body and goes so far as to cover about 
halfway down the thighs but has been parted at the front and back 
for added mobility. The stiff hauberk offers no adornment except 
for a simple band of black cloth sewn along the collar and along 
the sides where the straps fasten.

a rune-carved, single-edged battleaxe~
A rune-carved, single-edged battleaxe lies here.~
   Whoever crafted this battleaxe was truly a master of their 
craft. It is utilitarian in design, with a wedge-shaped blade. 
Its head is narrower than that of a splitting maul, making the 
weapon lighter than its agrarian counterparts, and the edge's 
weight is counterbalanced by a short, thick, spike on the 
opposite end. The steel is watered, and seems to possess a smoky 
quality. Sharp, angular runes have been etched into the 
axe-head, where it is socketed onto its haft. The haft is of 
oak, perfectly oval in shape, and heavily-polished despite 
various nicks and dents. Toward the base, the craftsman has 
lightly abraded the wood, allowing for a firm grip without 
wrapping it in leather. Its butt is capped in steel, a corded 
leather strap threaded through a small eyelet.

An anvil-pendant made of iron and set on black cord lies here~
   A long piece of black cord allows this necklace to be slipped 
over the head with ease. The pendant itself is little more than 
a cut, hammered flat piece of iron, about the size of a coin. 
The edges have been rounded, preventing accidental injury on the 
corners.

A set of finely-carved, $finecolor seated, pinewood chairs are here~
   Made of pinewood and polished to a dull, smooth sheen. These 
four chairs are the work of a craftsman. Four sturdy, pine legs, 
each carved into a thin, curved form, lead up to the supports, 
each carved with curves and worls in the wood. A $finecolor 
tanned stretch of leather, securely fasted with cord, reaches 
across the supports. The arms of the backrest have also been 
carved into similar curves and worls, joining in the middle to 
form an intricately designed circular headpiece at the top of the 
chair.

An intricately carved, pinewood table stands here~
   This table is made of pinewood and is polished to a dull, 
smooth sheen. It is supported by four columns of carved pine, 
becoming thicker as they reach up towards the frame. The frame 
is carved into a series of intricate worls and curves, the center 
of each of the four supports, forming a twisting knot. The 
tabletop itself, has been left mostly plain, the motif of the 
frame continues around the edge in a lighter carve. Eight chairs 
are set around the table.

   Three thin rods of iron have been twisted around each other to 
form the circlet of this torc. At each end, a snarling, 
serpentine head has been crafted, one with an open mouth and the 
other closed, made to look as if one is in the act of engulfing 
the other. Each of the metal rods have been marked with U-shape 
patterns, perhaps in an attempt to show the scales of a snake. 
It is a very fine piece of jewelry and has been polished to a 
high shine.

an engraved, iron-bladed longsword~
An engraved, iron-bladed sword with a wide, many-lobed pommel lies here.~
   The long blade of this sword is wide at its base and stretches 
easily past three feet, having a deep fuller that run down its 
slowly tapering length to its rounded point. Several soft 
inundating bands of different shades run down the iron blade's 
tempered length, indicating it has been skillfully forged from 
several billets of varying quality. The short hilt of white ash 
could only be held with one hand, and the iron crossguard curving 
to the blade is only wide enough to barely clear its base on 
either end. In contrast, the large triangular pommel of iron is 
easily as wide as the base of the blade, and has many lobes 
spanning its width, accented by gold twisted wire in between them 
and also on its base that curves away from the blade. The large 
pommel provides a good counterweight for the large blade, 
providing a balance that makes the sword an agile, powerful 
cutter wielded with one hand, but could be used for other moves 
with reasonable ease. Both crossguard and pommel are skillfully 
engraved with a complex interlacing pattern of gracefully 
swirling and flowing lines.

   This pair of trousers is rather baggy with no pockets or 
opening in the front, held up only by a belt at the waist. The 
fabric sewn for this garment is made of thick wool, very sturdy 
yet itchy to those with sensitive skin. They have been 
evenly-dyed $color but from knee to ankle, dark-colored spjarrar, 
or swathing bands, have been wrapped tightly to gather the 
voluminous fabric of the pants as well as for added warmth and 
protection against dense bruse vegetation in the wilds.

   This pair of trousers is made for durability and warmth, the 
woolen fabric woven so thickly and with skill that it is 
resistent to water and dirt. The trousers lacks any beltloops or 
pockets and requires one to wear a belt to hold up the heavy 
garment while spjarrar, or swathing bands, dyed a rich $color 
color have been wrapped snugly and in many layers around the 
wearer's legs from knee to ankle to help keep the wearer warm 
even while walking through snow upon the ground as well as 
protecting one from dense undergrowth.

   Covered in itchy dull rust red wool, this old pine bed is far 
from in the prime of its life. Rickety, uneven legs fill most 
nights with a slight motion, at the slightest of movements from 
the occupier. A headrest has been placed at the top of the bed, 
though is rather useless due to a few missing nails, unless it 
has been placed against a wall. A hole-filled, straw mattress 
only adds to the discomfort sure to be felt by those of thinner 
skins, who have the misfortune to own or sleep on this poor 
quality bed.

An ancient, enruned battleaxe lies here, glinting in the ambient light.~
   This ancient weapon was forged long ago by careful hands. Its 
two heads glimmer with luster still, bearing an etched trio of 
mountains on each flat. The peak of the tallest mountain, 
rendered in great detail, is enshrouded in ominous cloud cover. 
Runes float above the opposing peaks, elongated slightly as if 
falling like stars from the heavens. Its haft is shorter than 
one would expect as if meant for the hands of one who is shorter 
and weighted for one who is stout. Though this weapon is of 
great age, its edge is still sharp and well honed.

with a thin tassel of tan-leather cording fitted into it. On the 
opposite end, a half-moon shaped piece of iron forms the main 
cutting edge of the weapon, which proceeds back through the haft, 
secured with leather cording, to the other side where a wicked 
looking spike juts out. It is not of great craftsmanship, but is 
serviceable and sturdy.

   Three fingers high and slightly wider than shoulder's width, 
this $finecolor sleeping pallet is surprisingly comfortable for 
its size. Cunningly made, the mattress features a double layered 
construction, all enfolded in a durable mattress casing of woven 
linen. The bottom inner layer is stuffed with fragrant 
sweetgrass, adding bulk and lending the pallet its sweet, restful 
scent. The second layer sits atop the first and is stuffed with 
goose down, providing comfort and insulation from the ground. A 
thin blanket of a silken, woven material rests atop the pallet, 
and though light, it is surprisingly warm and wards off the 
night's chill. Altogether, the pallet is warm, comfortable, and 
a welcome respite to the weary.

A rigid spear with a tapering, leaf-shaped blade leans here.~
   An old, timeworn length of oak wood forms the shaft, and at 
the very top is a broad, tapering leaf-shaped blade which has 
been sharpened to a very fine, careful edge. The business end of 
the spear is forged together by the wood of the shaft being split 
right down the middle, and then the tang of the blade wedged in 
deep - wrapped up with leather to close it shut, securing it 
tightly. The overall length of the spear is roughly seven foot, 
leather again wrapped around it in two places to provide ample 
grip. Though quite heavy, this spear could inflict great damage 
if wielded with the appropriate strength, especially from the 
back of a mount.

a razor-sharp, dark-bladed axe with a leather-wrapped handle~
A razor-sharp, dark-bladed axe with a leather-wrapped handle lies here.~
   The razor sharp blade of this sturdy axe is made of high 
quality iron and measures a foot in length, the dark metal is 
well cared for and spotchless. The axehead itself is bearded and 
straight at the top then drops in a long curve towards the haft 
of the axe and then curves away from the haft at the bottom. 
Opposite the axehead a short trianglar blade juts through the 
haft for added balance and use against thick armor. The oak haft 
measures two and half feet and curves along the handle to aid in 
grip and swinging, lengths of corded leather have been wrapped 
around in even spaces along the handle of the axe.

a fur-trimmed, leather thong~
A fur-trimmed leather thong lies here.~
   This leather thong is meant to be worn as an undergarment for 
women. A v-shaped cut of supple leather is worn at the front 
while a very thin, leather cord serves as the back of this piece. 
The side ties are trimmed with soft, black fur though the fur has 
been removed from the cord where it meets the tiny, bronze 
buckles, allowing the wearer to adjust the garment along the 
hips. Overall, the piece is very scandalous and is meant to be 
worn under other pieces of clothing.

A verdant, green surcoat lies here in a bundle.~
   This surcoat is made out of finest linen, supple and flowing, 
made to be worn over heavy armor. There is great craftsmanship 
behind every stitch, ever flowing edge. It opens in the front 
and has no sleeves attached, created to provide great freedom for 
its wearer. The color of the linen is a verdant green, and a 
coat of arms bearing five white pillars decorate the back and the

a flowing, silken cloak of shadow-grey hues~
A flowing, silken cloak of shadow-grey hues lies here.~
   A smooth fall of soft fabric that reaches nearly to the 
ankles, this cloak drapes from the shoulders and enfolds the 
body. The material is silken in nature, soft and light yet 
strangely warm for its weight. It is difficult to say what 
colour the cloak is: grey with the hue of twilight, yet in 
another light it seems green as shadowed leaves or brown as 
fallow fields by night. A deep, lined hood of the same silken 
material falls back from the shoulders and, when raised, the 
cloak veils the wearer entirely. A broad mallorn leaf showing 
its summer colours forms the clasp; bright silver below with a 
coating of pale green enamel atop, the artistry of the leaf so 
precise that it would be difficult to tell the clasp from a 
living leaf. This clasp pins the cloak upon the right breast, 
fixing the garment securely together.

   This table has been skilfully and beautifully fashioned in a 
curved sickle-shape, like an incomplete circle. The wood is dark 
and rich and very smooth although a very fine leaf-detail follows 
its edge delicately. High-backed chairs with vine-engraved arms 
are positioned neatly around it on the outer edge of the table, 
leaving the inner edge clear for the serving of food and drink.

the sunken garden on the mossy turf, fed from a nearby spring. 
It rises to about waist-heigh on the average being its dark stone 
wet with the rivulets of water running down into a small pool 
about it. Reeds and small flowers grow up around it adding to 
its beauty.

In a furry clump here, lies a thick, hooded black bearskin cloak.~
   A single thick, black bearskin has been carefully tanned 
before being made into this very warm cloak. The front arms of 
the hide have been left long enough to meet together when wrapped 
around a person. A large claw attached near the end of the right 
arm has been sewn in place. When slipped into a slit sewn into 
the left arm it holds the cloak securely. It is long enough and 
big enough to completely wrap its wearer in black fur. A deep 
hood to protect the head from the elements hangs back when not in 
use.

   Simple in shape and cut, this grey marble sarcophagus sits at 
about five feet high and six feet long, its rectangular shape 
engraved with a thick band of ancient sigils, their meaning long 
since lost. Smooth and well polished, the stone has weathered 
little though marching time. Two long strips of rotted, torn 
velvet display a ruined pattern of heraldry, only the faintest 
glints of golden embroidery still visible. Situated within the 
sarcophagus, the splintered remains of a wooden coffin have 
buckled and rotted, betraying the corpse within to the air.

curved to remove most of the harsh corners while the inside is 
lined with many layers of plush furs to pad the walls of the

cradle is the simple carving of a horse in mid stride and the 
whole thing rests upon two, rounded wedges that allow it to be 
gently rocked from side to side.

elbow of the same sleeve is covered by a elbow panel of similar 
design. The lighter sleeve has been constructed of the same 
leather material as the under layer of its more developed mate. 
The smaller sleeve looks to have been designed to work best with 
a shield.

that hang like shingles to protect the wearer's neck. The piece 
stitches together in the back and hangs from the top of the neck 
to splay over the shoulders, back and chest to some degree. 
While the piece looks mildly constraining the protection it 
offers makes it more than admirable as a garment.

sturdy bone nose guard that looks to be fastened to the framework 
that provides the support for the piece. The hide that the helm 
is made of is of a thick white lizard skin comprised of tiny 
pebbly scales. A stripe of fangs run from the front of the head 
and down the back in a single line.

To large to be considered a buckler it looks to have been 
designed for a smaller wearer. The back panel is a series of 
radiating rib bones of some large beast with leather ties to 
affix it to the wearer's arm. The front of the shield is a 
strange scaled white hide that has been stretched tightly across 
its front. The edge of the shield is covered in animal fangs 
that point outward toward any opponent and look to be designed to 
discourage grappling attacks.

dissimilar material that conforms more readily to the ground than 
the pebbly white scales of the upper lizard skin.

A broad shield emblazoned with a red, roaring lion has been left here.~
   Boards of hard, heavy oak are held togeather by iron bandings 
and nails, forming this broad shield. The upper part is square 
in shape but two thirds down, it narrows into a rounded point. A 
leather strap for the forearm sits before a handle of smoothened 
oak, forcing a wearer to carry it on the left arm or upside down. 
The front side is painted, and a faded ivory base covers the 
shield. Upon it in clearer red is painted a fierce, red lion - 
which upon close inspection details the beast frozen in a gaping 
roar, somehow wielding a greatsword between its teeth. Overall 
the shield seems sturdy and reliable, though perhaps somewhat 
heavy.

polished to a rough whitish sheen with veins of yellow and brown 
running through it from the base, which has been capped in bronze 
molding with a small northern-tengwar script etched into it. A 
thick and sturdy length of leather runs through a bronze ring at 
the top of the capping, and fastens in the back of the neck with 
a small, simple, bronze clasp.

hangs straight down, leaving the lower legs bare.

   A crystal gem of purest white has been cut delicately in an 
oval shape. Of masterful craftsmanship, it has many facets and

small enough to fit in the centre of the palm of a hand. It is 
set in a filigree gold frame and hangs from a gold chain.

A four-posted bed carved to resemble tree saplings is in the room.~
   This bed has been masterfully carved. It is easily large 
enough for two tall beings to sleep upon it with ease and each of 
its four posts have been carved to resemble young tree saplings. 
The resemblance is life-like and smaller branches extend out of 
the posts at the top to create a natural-looking canopy. The bed 
is covered in satin sheets and is sweetly-scented.

A silver-roped gown lies here in a pile of lustrous, sapphire blue silk.~
   This gown lacks sleeves or straps of any kind. Support and 
shape is lent by braided silvery ropes that are wound under the 
bodice in a criss-cross pattern, then looped twice around the 
midsection to cinch in the waist. Beautiful silver embroidery 
runs around the top hem of the dress, while the rest of the silk 
is left to drape and flutter free, falling open in a silt to one 
of her knees to make mobility easier. The quality of the silk 
weave is magnificent, and the embroidery and style of the gown is 
clearly elvish in design.

recurved and widening at the tip. The hilt is narrow, curving as 
though it were the blade in miniature, and wrapped in indigo 
leather. The blade itself is razor-sharp, and crafted from 
blackened steel, surprisingly light. It it single-edged, a 
serrated ricasso lending it strength. This is obviously meant as 
a slashing weapon, as there is very little point at all. Though 
lacking in decoration, it was obviously crafted by a master, 
given its balance.

with a large, overwrought appearance. It is cast and carved with 
swirling lines, worked deeply into the metal, that stretch around 
the golden curves and meet in the inscription of a wyrm's head at 
the top of the ring. It is a wide device and large, though not 
unwearably so. It is fairly simple in its design, but the 
quality of the gold itself seems to be of a very rare sort and 
its symbolic inscription is unique.

A somber, modestly-sized, stone shack~
A somber, modestly-sized, stone shack is set amidst the stone markers.~
   Two man-sized rock statues depicting stern-faced guardians are 
set to either side of a shack comprised of grey stacked stones 
tinted a dingy gray from long years of weathering and a lack of 
maintenance, its form set amidst the foliage and depths of the 
graveyard, surrounded on all sides by the headstones and markers 
of those past. Rotted lumber sits precariously atop the 
structure, acting as a roof of sorts although it isn't clear 
exactly how effective it is in its purpose, while a cut out 
circle to the side allows for a small stone chimney to penetrate 
outwards. Sloping up from the west, the roof creases at the 
center and slopes likewise down the eastern part of the building 
which appears to be smaller and of slightly newer make than the 
rest. Upon the southern side of the structure is a window, its 
shutters long since removed and its opening covered from the 
inside by sturdy wood. The door appears newer in relative 
comparison to the rest, the wood thick and heavy throughout the 
entirety of its squared frame, though there does not appear to 
any sort of way to open it.

A bedraggled stone tower sits amidst the rubble, surrounded by a hastily constructed palisade.~
   Displaced stone and debris, scorched and tarnished by flames 
and destruction long since past, is scattered about the base of a 
dilapidated tower seemingly constructed of the same material as 
is cast violently about its surrounds. Rising three stories 
above the ground, the reformed structure is based around a 
circular center tower flanked by two single storied wings jutting 
off diagonally. Battlements reinforced with stone outcroppings 
and dirt-filled sacks protrude from the top of the central tower 
which flies a standard marked with a white rose, its stem woven 
around a downward thrusting blade. Roughly-hewn palisades are 
posted in a squared pattern around its perimeter, lashed together 
with freshly-woven and heavy ropes, their knotted forms twisting 
into each other before peaking at shaved tops ending in formed 
wooden spikes. A small gap is exposed within a section of the 
palisade set before the towers front, a gate enclosing it within.

Moonlight projects the shadow of a spidery-fingered figure out across a clearing in the woodland.~
   As the moonlight strikes a fork-limbed tree, this shadow is 
cast out across a clearing in the woodland. It appears very 
realistically, moving and swaying as though alive in the mild 
breeze and grows seemingly aggressive in much stronger winds. 
This dark shade is rather hard to distinguish in form, it appears 
as a spidery-fingered individual from the waist up - slashing 
artfully in the air with its sharp claw-like hands, but below 
that, it fades into nothing.

a spiny tree clad in sharp, black bark~
A spiny tree clad in sharp, black bark stands here with a looming, eerie presence.~
   Fairly thin at the trunk, this tree towers high into the air. 
Limbs break off in abrupt, peculiar angles - spiking to a 
shear-like tip at the very end. Growing off of each branch, the 
leaves of this young tree are very firm and leathery, curling in 
like buttons. The color of this particular tree is most 
intriguing. It is completely black, from the top to the bottom - 
seemingly invisible at night time when nestled amongst other 
vegetation.

a gnarled, warp-limbed tree~
A gnarled tree with warped limbs groans loud noises of protest here, branches lifelessly limp.~
   Standing high in the air, this flimsy limbed tree stands with 
a spooky presence. It dominates a large portion of air, standing 
further broad than high. The trunk is old, armored with shards 
of crackling, sharp bark. The ground around it is pale, just as 
the tree itself is - roots twisting and weaving amongst each 
other, driving deep and burrowing into the soil. The leaves of 
this old tree appear sharp, but really, they are so dry that once 
they have been touched, they crumble into dust.

a massive, dim shadow shaped like a man~
A hulking, pitch-black shadow in the shape of a Man is cast here.~
   To those with keen sight or light to see by, this shadow is 
huge; truly, it is cast against the forest floor like something 
out of a nightmare. Its origins are unclear, but with all of the 
old, hulking trees in this forest - it could be anything.

Still, the sharp rocks that mark the home of the dead stand as a

a figure of garish features made from wool and straw~
A garish figure made from straw-stuffed wool hangs high from a wooden pole.~
   Hanging perhaps eight feet up from a wooden pole and nailed 
into its side, this straw-stuffed figure looms above you. In the 
dimly lit night, its painted-on features are garish and twisted. 
Its coal-black buttons for eyes seem to almost be alive and 
watching, and its prickly arms reach about with the force of the 
wind, as if they were searching for something in the shadows.

Jagged edges of shattered bones protrude from the unidentifiable remains of a large beast, its chest splayed open with crusted entrails spilling out from within.~
   Small, white, worms slither their way in and out of the 
various organs displayed so predominantly within the beasts chest 
cavity, their own abdomens swollen from the feast upon which they 
have partaken. Blood has crusted upon the entrails spilling out 
and alongside the corpse, teeth and tearing marks visible upon 
its rigor-mortised flesh.

Pale orbs of ebbing #4blue light#0 fade in and out of focus here, floating above the ground.~
   Based around a bright epicenter, these orbs move in a dance of

noticeable glimmer before returning into a force of shining 
brilliance, faint trails of smoky light shooting out from within 
and off into the distance before disappearing.

Shadows, intermingled and ever-shifting, dance throughout the dimness of the area.~
   These shadows form and shift fluidly amongst each other, 
casting thin, finger-like tendrils out over the landscape which 
seem to grasp upon all that they can before slithering back to 
their origins. They move through and within each other, their 
shapes often coming into frightening human resemblance.

   Constructed of loosely packed dirt set amongst heavy stones, 
this mound seems to have once served as the barrier between its 
inhabitant and the rest of the world. This purpose seems long 
since passed, however, as a deformed, bitted, and gnawed hand 
sticks out from within, two of its five fingers severed at the 
joints with meaty strings of flesh hanging aside.

itself down upon humanoid forms beneath, its fire engulfing them 
all in a brilliant cascade of fire and death.

a large, well-crafted, bearded waraxe~
A large, single-bitted, bearded waraxe lies here, unused.~
   The head of this enormous weapon is made of thick, high 
quality iron. From the eye where the head has been attached, the 
blade's throat is extremely narrow, creating a relatively fragile 
look. The blade quickly curves outward, however, the beard of 
the axe lengthening the dangerous cutting edge significantly. 
The haft is nearly five and a half feet in length, and made of 
hardy oak, ending in a slightly curved knob. At the top of the 
weapon, an unadorned bronze haft-cap has been set, serving as 
both decoration and to keep the axehead in place. Leather cord 
has been wrapped around the length of the haft in two places, to 
provide handholds.

   This greathelm is made of high quality dense iron to provide 
immaculate protection to the wearer, and except for the front, it 
is covered in the thick fur of a black mountain bear. There is a 
diamond shaped opening at the front of the helm, covered by a 
stylised visor resembling the mouth of a giant mountain grizzly, 
locked in a silent and furious roar. It consists of a pointed 
iron visor with more fur covering it to form the muzzle, and 
actual bear teeth embedded in the iron to form the mouth which 
doubles as the viewport for the wearer.

is hot and dark, gamey and deep red, juices sizzling as they drip 
in the heat.

   Frayed bits of straw, mutilated and cracked from well-received 
abuse stick out unevenly from the edges of ragtag clothing, 
soiled and besotten with all manner of dirt and stain. Scraggly 
sticks jut out at four points, acting as makeshift limbs, their 
gnarled and pock-marked features suitable for the gruesome manner 
which they are intended to imitate. A small plank of wood acts 
as the head, jutting out from the straw in a carved image of a 
grotesque face set in a constant state of fiery bitterness.

   This spear is around four and a half feet long and is meant to 
be wielded in one hand. The shaft is slender, allowing it to be 
used not only in combat but as a throwing weapon as well. The 
cedar wood of the shaft has been covered all along its length in 
rather ornate carvings of various animals ranging from eagles 
with wings spread wide to giant bears and even mystical creatures 
such as a large-fanged wyrm, each of the carvings darkened to 
bring out the detail, the indentations burned with precision. 
Mounted atop the spear is a broad, iron head that has been molded 
in the shape of a leaf, the tip razor sharp.

Hardened iron pyramids are set sturdily within each knuckle of these well-plushed gloves, the extra leather padded beneath by thick layers of cloth in an attempt to keep the iron rivets from coming to bear back upon their wearer.  Dyed an inky black, the leather of these gloves is well-tended and coarse to the touch, made for lasting effect and wear.  Small strands of rope slide through tightening-holes on the under-side, enabling the wearer to tighten or loosen them as they should see fit.

lantern, and when lit, the delicate lighting casts dancing 
shadows in a myriad of shades of the white, pinks, and purples of 
the blossoms.

silver and each bears a few small gems of varying colors.

a silver-hilted, throwing dagger~
A silver-hilted, throwing dagger lies on the ground here, glinting in any light.~
   This throwing dagger has a sleek blade made of steel, both 
sharply tipped and edged. The blade meets the hilt directly, 
lacking any crossguard. The hilt is formed of a smooth silver 
alloy, etched with a depiction of a perched raven. The grip on 
this blade is short, making it unwieldy for melee combat.

A massive, raven-embossed leather scabbard lies here.~
   This huge scabbard is designed to be worn across the back. It 
is crafted of black leather, and the edges are double-stitched in 
a silver thread. The throat of the scabbard is made of a silver 
alloy, and the tip of the sheath matches. This scabbard is very 
obviously designed for a specific blade in mind: long, broad, and 
slightly curved. The leather has been embossed with a depiction 
of a perched raven.

a gold-tinted, broad-bladed scimitar~
A massive scimitar, its blade tinted a golden color, lies here.~
   This scimitar is nothing short of massive. Its long, curved 
blade reaches a full four feet in length, and the blade in places 
is up to half a foot broad. It is clearly designed with lethal 
force in mind--a heavy and powerful weapon. The blade has a 
groove running along the center to make it more manageabe, and 
the polished metal has a gold tint to it. Etchings run along the 
back side of the blade in a flowing, elvish script. The 
crossguard is relatively unremarkable, slightly curved to lend 
elegance to the design. The long hilt of the weapon has been 
wrapped in the finest grain of soft leather, lending exceptional 
grip.

   This helmet had been crafted from shiny, burnished metal 
colored golden. The cheekguards are formed in the shape of bird 
wings, each feather meticulously detailed to where they follow 
along the jawline and end near the chin, leaving the face open 
enough to allow visibility and ease of breathing. The molded 
form of a raven lies flat against the top of the helm, the beak 
jutting downward to form the nose guard, and a tail protrudes out 
from the back of the helm, extending downward to cover a portion 
of the rear of the neck.

   This long and light-weight staff is crafted from quality rowan 
wood, and has been carefully silvered in its finish. It is very 
well-balanced to serve as either a walking-stick or a weapon in 
the right hands. It stands just over five feet in height, and 
much care was given by its maker to smooth its surface. Its 
sturdy quality of the staff hints at a re-enforcement of stronger 
substance at the staff's core, away from the polish and silvery 
shine of the visible wood.

colour with no blemishes and has no discolouration that you would 
expect for untreated wood. It is capped with silver on one end 
so to be useful as a walking stick.

by a third which wraps around the planks through knotted holes

A grey stone statue of a spear-wielding man protects a row of graves.~
   This statue is carved of smooth grey stone and placed at the 
front of a section of graves, detail chiseled carefully into its 
relief. A three-foot square stone base rests on the ground, 
rough forms of matching stone stretched behind it like 
unconscious men prostrate behind their protector. A towering 
large-browed man is carved life-size, standing a full 
seventy-three inches above the base, a cloak of bear-fur 
appearing to billow behind him as he moves. His oval face has a 
large brow with bushy-blond eyebrows furrowed in concentration as 
his hands thrust forward, both gripping a spear. Pronounced 
cheekbones flank a steep, straight nose. His hair is cropped 
short, standing upright like shaving bristle, and his face is 
smooth-shaven. Long, parallel scars cross his right eye and come 
down his right cheek and around to his ear, the lingering curves 
of the markings wild and jagged. His form crouches forward 
behind the spear thrust, poised for a sideways lunge, one of his 
tall boots half-raised in preperation.

   Solid in design, this war-axe was created for the simple 
purpose of killing. Its design does not lend itself to the image 
of chopping wood with its long-squared blade and spiked 
counter-balance for piercing even the heaviest of armor. The 
metal itself is of the highest quality iron, with a whorled 
texture like blown glass which denotes skill beyond the hand of 
Men. Etched deeply across both flats is a kingly looking bear 
rearing back on its hind legs and glaring out at its 
surroundings. Its paws are frozen in an angry slash through the 
air, and its head is thrown back in a roar of challenge. The 
war-axes haft is solid iron, ending in a leather-wrapped hilt for 
use with both one or two hands. Stamped into the bottom of the 
weapon is a tell-tale symbol that resembles a keg of ale.

A brilliantly shining plate mail gorget lies here, glimmering.~
   Forged by the hands of a master, this gorget is made of 
abnormally thick, high quality steel. Despite its thickness, it 
is abnormally light and durable with a slight bluish tinge to the 
grain of the metal. Bearing a high shine, it glints brilliantly 
in the presence of any light. Bearing no form of mark or symbol, 
this gorget is rather Spartan; lacking all form of aesthetics. 
There is no doubt that this exquisite piece affords the wearer 
superb protection against any form of attack.

personal entanglements. There is no doubt that this exquisite 
piece affords the wearer superb protection against any form of

sculpted into the shape of a seabird in flight, great care has 
gone into the depiction of swirling feathers upon the bird: every 
detail carved by small, fine lines. The seabird's wings are 
spread out to either side as it has been caught within an eternal 
soar, its legs extending to small, curved talons. Being quite 
artistic and decorative in its design, the pin can be fastened 
with an almost invisible, but sturdy, needle-thin clasp.

clearing dirty dirt Legolin-mines VEGETATION~
A dirty trash-filled clearing~
The land before this ridge has been clear-cut and is covered with remnants of bones, logs and half-eaten dead animals.~
   Strewn about the ground look to be the leftovers of a large 
group of orcs. Half-eaten corpses of local wildlife emit a 
horrid stench and various bones, tree-stumps and rocks lay 
haphazardly about the clearing. The ground-cover has been lain 
flat from extensive foot-falls and the spruce forest has been 
decimated here, leaving little more than a grouping of stumps. 
The remnants of a fire pit sits at the edge of the cliffside, its 
ashes cold yet not gone.

#1A bloody pile of half-eaten animal corpses lies strewn about here being picked over by birds of prey.~
   Large bits of flesh and meat have been ripped from the corpses 
of the dead animals here. Some bones broken cleanly off and left 
in a pile off to one side. Guts and gore ooze out of the 
remaining bits of the dead, to be picked over by birds of prey 
and scavengers alike.

a small rock-lined firepit~
A small pile of rocks and ashes sits abandoned near the eastern cliff.~
   This looks to be hastily built fire pit of rock shards of the 
surrounding cliffs. Bits of charred wood can be seen within the 
ashes and a shard of iron that seems to have been used as a poker 
is stuck in between the rocks.

A tasty slice of egg-topped, herb-scented pork loaf sits here.~
   The meaty drippings from this butter-fried slice of chopped 
pork are absorbed by the crust of lightly buttered bread it is 
served upon. The meat itself is speckled with the white and 
orange of the vegetables minced into it. The top of the loaf has 
been finished off with a bit of fried egg in the center.

an iron lever portruding out of a box-shaped device~
A metal box sits against the village gate, housing an iron lever.~
   This metal device is a rectangular box in shape that stands 
about four feet high, two feet wide and five feet deep; it is 
secured to the ground and to palisade wall with large, iron 
nails. Portruding up out of the top of the device is a long, 
iron lever that can be pulled or pushed with some leeway given by 
the ovular opening in the top of the box. Running out of the 
back of the box, and stretching up into a hole at the top of the 
eastern gatehouse, are a pair of extremely thick, iron-cast 
chains that dangle aimlessly with the tossing and turning of the 
wind.

heavy midnight-black wyrm overcoat emblemed UNIQUE_POFNIKLAUS LEATHER~
a heavy midnight-black, wide-collared, wyrm-emblemed overcoat~
A heavy midnight-black, wide-collared, wyrm-emblemed overcoat lies here.~
   This long, midnight-black overcoat is made of thick, yet 
supple leather, heavy in design and rugged with double-stitched 
seams. It closes in front with a row of buttons up to the 
collar, hanging open just below the waist to allow for freedom of 
movement. The cuffs and hem are folded and stitched with buttons 
being added to the cuffs, though they are merely aesthetic in 
design. Over the shoulders and back a leather shawl is attached 
for added protection against the elements. The collar about the 
neckline is wide, cut in a triangular pattern so that it can be 
worn folded down or up to keep the wind from the wearer's face. 
The interior of the coat is lined in linen for added comfort. 
Sewn to the back of the coat is the red-dyed emblem of a coiled, 
wolf-headed wyrm with bat-like wings, about a foot in length from 
nose to tip, while over the body of the wyrm is set a 
cross-stitched pattern resembling scales.

a blonde-haired, russet-brown eyed infant boy~
A blonde-haired, russet-brown eyed infant boy awaits attention here.~
   This male infant has a very young appearance, his open mouth 
showing empty gums as he often stares, largely bewildered at the 
world around him. His arms and legs have grown a layer of fat, 
giving him a chubbier, rounded look. When awake, his russet 
brown eyes are wide and dewy and capped with feathery lashes. 
His light blonde hair tuffs up in a downy cap from his head - 
growing slightly unruly. On his neck appears a small birthmark - 
a round port-wine stork-bite, the only mark on his soft skin.

an ancient, blackened-iron sword~
An ancient, blackened-iron sword lies here.~
   This sword, well-crafted of blackened iron, bears remarkable 
craftsmanship. It is well cared for, the blade polished to a 
shine and the edge keen, despite a few small marks marring the 
flat of the blade and the crossguard. It is old, evident by the 
wearing upon the leather of the grip. A fuller runs three 
quarters of the way up the heavy blade, with the tip curving to a 
point. The pommel is plain but for a few markings, perhaps 
identifying either the maker or the owner of the weapon.

a long, dark braid of hair~
A long, dark braid of hair lies here, threatening to unravel.~
   This braid hair has been intricately twined. It is made of 
thin, dusty-brown hair, and it is about two feet in length. The 
braid itself looks much like a length of rope, the hair twirling 
around itself in two parts of three sections. Intertwined with 
the braid, a thin cord of vine-like wood, accentuated with small 
buds, holds the hair together, and keeps the braid from fraying.

A thickly-furred lionskin cloak lies here abandoned.~
   The exterior of this cloak reveals the underside of numerous 
pelts, sewn neatly together and waxed over for waterproofing. 
They have been finely-tanned, the leather soft to the touch, 
ivory-yellow in color. Within, the furs of the great beasts 
remain, warming the wearer considerably. Only pure pelts have 
been chosen, universally golden in color. The head of a great 
lion makes up its hood, masterfully preserved.

warhammer hammer narrow fist spike UNIQUE POFEACHAN METAL~
a narrow-headed, fist-shaped hammer~
A narrow-headed, fist-shaped hammer with a counterspike lies here.~
   This masterfully-crafted weapon is not possessed of dual 
utility, as so many warhammers are. It is clearly designed as a 
utensil of war its head is far smaller than a smith's hammer, and 
shaped like a fist, the better to concentrate its force. The 
five knuckles protrude slightly, designed to smash through armor. 
This is counterbalanced by a long spike on the other side, point 
sharp but edges dull. The weapon's shaft is crafted from heavy 
oak, and iron rivets run along its length, sealing the two 
components together. A leather cord is threaded through a small 
knob on the bottom, providing a loop to hang from a hook or belt.

A willowy, flaxen-haired young woman lies here, still and serene.~
   Cool with the undeniable look of death, this young woman seems 
serene and peaceful - her expression one of sleep. No visible 
marks mar her body, save those that obviously came during her 
life - rough, slightly calloused hands the markings of a 
hard-working woman. Her willowy build seems all the more fragile 
now, her flaxen hair splayed out behind her as she lies in state.
