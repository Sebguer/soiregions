auto-create frog toad CAO_FROG~
an auto-create frog~
An auto-create frog is here, taking up space.~
   This small creature is one of many of its species that call 
this marshy area home, sneaking their way into homes and shops 
uninvited in their constant quest searching out tasty small 
insects to slap out of the air with a long tongue. Loud and 
obnoxious, the constant croaks and other sounds leaving this 
amphibian make it a sore sight as well as a burden on the ears.

Thoruld healer broad straw man HEALER_CAO CRAEG_SHOP~
a broad-shouldered straw-haired man~
A broad-shouldered straw-haired man stands near the counter.~
   This handsome young man has the straight, forward features of 
the Northern peoples. His shoulder-length straw-colored hair, 
wide broad shoulders, and tall stature speak proudly about his 
Race. Clear greenish-blue eyes watch the shopfront carefully, in 
between periods of laziness where he stands about the shop idly, 
before being hen-pecked by the shopkeep to return to his guarding 
duties or to attend or heal patients.

a slender, plaited-blonde young woman~
A slender, plaited-blonde young woman bustles behind the counter.~
   Tall and narrow of build, this woman has an air of purpose. 
Her narrow nose flanked by high cheekbones highlights her 
ice-blue eyes, her blonde hair plaited in a long row down her 
back. Her fingers are dappled and stained brown by some sort of 
juices. She seems in constant motion, straightening and fussing 
about herself and her surroundings as she often shouts orders at 
her lazy-acting companion nearby.

a huge, greenish-brown slithering snake~
A huge, greenish-brown snake slithers through the swamp here.~
   Monstrously huge, this intricately-scaled snake dips in and 
out of the swampy waters of its home. It is greenish-brown with 
a double row of black oval spots on the back and smaller white 
markings on the sides and its scaly skin glistens but is dry is 
to the touch. The nostrils are on top of the snout, letting the 
snake breathe easily when it is in the water. It smells with its 
tongue and has few fangs, choosing instead to use its massive 
thirty-five foot body to wrap around it's prey, constricting it 
until it is dead and then eating the prey whole.

A stern-featured old man with blonde braids stands here grimly.~
   A stern browed and strong jawed old man looks out at the world 
with a fierceness that time seems to have been unable to dim. 
His skin is pasty and looks to have been roughened by exposure to 
the elements. Two blond braids corral his hair away from his 
face and hang down his slightly bowed back. His hands are 
scarred by many small white lines and appear quite nimble.

a hatchet-nosed, goateed man~
A hatchet-nosed, goateed man stands behind the counter, helping customers.~
   Dominating the rest of his face, this man's sharp, hatchet 
like nose is quite prominent, the blue eyes on either side of it 
taking second place. Covering his chin is a thick growth of 
auburn whiskers, meticulously trimmed into a well kept goatee. 
Slightly darker than his whiskers, reddish-brown hair is cut into 
a utilitarian style, stopping short of his somewhat large ears. 
Broad-shouldered and rangy, his limbs seem strong, though his 
belly is covered in a layer of fat, giving him a bit of a barrel 
like shape, the frame of one accustomed to heavy lifting but not 
quick motion.

A bulbous-nosed heterochromatic man tends shop here.~
   This man's quite large, reddened bulbous nose sits next to 
small veiny patches of his wide cheeks. More unusual perhaps, 
sit his mismatched eyes - one a soft, grass-green and the other a 
rich, chocolate-brown. Despite or perhaps in light of his 
appearance, this man more often than not has a wide, smiling 
mouth, and a friendly disposition to customers and visitors.

A honey-skinned shaggy-haired gypsy boy hawkes wares here.~
   This boy, certainly no older than ten, alternates between 
standing and hawking wares, and sitting under the eave of the 
vardo stationed in the yard. Honey-skinned with a rough-cut crop 
of cordovan-colored hair, his shaggy coif covers his eyes a 
majority of the time. On the rare occassion they peep out, they 
display a rich sapphirean hue. Lanky and thin in structure, he 
appears a high-wound and easily exciteable sort. His unusual 
eclectric dress and foreign scent out this child as a gypsy.

A graceful, white-hued bird stands here, perched on one leg.~
   Rising to a grown mans knee, this large bird stalks the land 
carefully. Starting with a pointed, orange beak and beady eyes 
it stands alert and graceful. An 'S' shaped neck leads down to 
an oval body, which is beset by long, folded wings. Its legs are 
long, most often perched upon one over the other. Upon its neck, 
downy hair of black and white falls.

Rana UNIQUE_PRAHLIUS wolfish mutt brown shaggy fur~
a wolfish mutt, with brown shaggy fur~
A wolfish mutt, with brown shaggy fur sniffs the ground here.~
   It is easy to see at first glance that this mutt has a wide 
branching family tree that encompasses a vast and varied 
ancestry. With a wolf-like face with triangular ears, where one 
of which has been almost entirely torn off, a long, scarred 
snout, and feral turn of the eyes, it would appear predatory if 
it didn't have to look through a sheet of thick hair that goes 
partially over its eyes. If one looks close enough, one eye is 
black while the other is a stunning shade of crystal blue. They 
are intelligent and measuring and match the wary set of its 
shoulders. Its legs are long and its flanks are well muscled and 
protrude even from beneath its thick matt of brown fur. This dog 
has a wild, feral look to it like so many other dogs left to 
themselves to roam.

An auto-create Graehim warhorse whinies here.~
   Standing around eighteen hands high, this well-bred horse 
maintains a proud and dignified bearing, its muscled form with 
feathered-forelock and thick hooves obviously designed for 
warfare not the plow. Shiny, black intelligent eyes look about 
its surroundings, though loud noise of sudden movement of rider 
does little to displace the attention of this well-trained beast. 
A shiny, full mane and tail, and a soft coat of well-brushed skin 
give the powerful form of this animal a graceful air.

An ice-eyed, strawberry-blonde middle-aged woman tends shop here.~
   This strawberry-blonde young woman, barely past her teens 
looks over the customers who visit this shop with her pale, 
ice-blue colored eyes. She seems friendly, giving customers a 
smile as they approach, which parts her lips to show her slightly 
gapped front teeth, though her attitude seems to sour 
considerably when approached by already sodden customers seeking 
the wares she watches. Of moderate height and slightly muscled 
tone, she gives the impression of being used to work.

a young woman with sun-colored hair and blue eyes~
A young woman with sun-colored hair and blue eyes stands behind the counter.~
   Rather young in her adulthood, this woman is still a bit lanky 
in her build. She has sun-colored hair which she keeps braided 
around her ears. Her bright blue eyes shine from her tanned and 
freckled face. She stands about average height for a Northern 
lass and carries herself with an inner strength and fortitude 
that comes from living a live in the harshness of the Burgs to 
the north. Her smile, however, counters that firmness of her 
jawline and lights the room when it appears on her face.

a chubby dog with flecked, white fur~
A chubby dog with flecked, white fur is here.~
   This dog's back reaches about to the height of the average 
man's knee, placing his large head somewhere near the waist. He 
looks very much like a mutt; a large lug of a dog who has an ear 
flopped down over one brown eye, and then the other standing 
straight up above the other. His fur, standing straight up, is 
flecked with white and gray, giving him a rather dirty look, even 
when he is clean. His body is round and healthy, tail long and 
standing straight up, except for the curl on the very top.

a tall, one-eyed man with blonde hair~
A tall, one-eyed man with long blond hair oversees the storefront.~
   Standing rather tall, this man is strong and well built, from 
obvious years of hard labor. His single blue eye shines out from 
his rugged and scarred face, giving way his jovial manner. He 
has long blond hair which he routinely keeps pulled back in a 
leather thong.

a gangly blond-haired artist~
A gangly, blond-haired artist stands before an easel musing.~
   Thin and gangly, this man looks to be in his young adult 
years. His long blond hair is tied haphazardly behind his head 
and his bright blue eyes fill a face that is angled and thin. 
His long limbs are accented by a wistful air of carefree 
exuberance. Paint covers most of clothes most of the time and 
sometimes even his face and hands.

creamy white stallion Bregowyd POFVARISH~
a creamy-white maned, white-coated stallion~
A creamy-white maned, white-coated stallion snorts out his nose here.~
Standing barely above the height of a common man's shoulder, this well-bred horse maintains a proud and dignified bearing, its muscled form with feathered-forelock obviously designed for warfare not the plow. Shiny, black intelligent eyes look about its surroundings, though loud noise of sudden movement of rider does little to displace the attention of this well-trained beast. A shiny, full mane and tail, and a soft coat of well-brushed skin give the powerful form of this animal a graceful air.

A tiny, wildly-fluffy grey kitten plays here.~
   This minuscule kitten seems little more than a ball of 
storm-grey fur, dotted with a few small patches of creamy white. 
Small, ivory feet serve to pad the small creature around, and an 
ever-flicking bushy tail gives it a mischievous looking nature. 
A ragged, white stripe runs from the top of his head to a tiny, 
grey nose, where it pitters out into little flecks, accenting the 
bases of long, pale whiskers. Large, bright blue eyes peer out 
from beneath the masses of fluff, always wide and keen on their 
surroundings.

A runty, full-grown spotted mutt is here.~
   This full-grown dog still looks more like a puppy, perhaps 
because he's not much bigger than one; most likely the runt of 
the litter. He has a slight limp to one of his back legs, only 
particularly noticeable during moments of heightened excitement. 
His long, floppy ears are brown, much like the rest of his short 
coat, but a few splotchy white spots mar the otherwise uniform 
color. One particularly big patch covers half his face, 
emphasizing one large brown eye and one large blue one. His 
eyebrows are particularly expressive, often shifting between 
unbidden excitement and pensive thought in a matter of moments.

a slate-grey coated stallion~
A slate-grey coated stallion is here.~
   Standing roughly at the height of a man's shoulder, this horse 
maintains a proud and dignified facade. Its head is held high, 
intelligent eyes glaring out into the distance, and a thick, 
healthy-looking mane runs down the back of its neck. Its coat 
appears well-cared-for, and a thick, knotted layer of muscle 
ripples gracefully beneath its sleek skin.

A straight-legged, grey-coated mare is here.~
   Of average bulk and graceful tone, this creature's coat and
mane are well-groomed and cut, hinting that it leads a life of
domestication rather than one in the wilderness. Standing tall
on four muscular legs, there is no hesitancy or fear detectable
in this horse's posture, seemingly ready to spring into a flurry
of action and motion at a moment's notice.

Toki stallion battle ebon horse POFVARISH~
a battle-scarred, ebon-coated stallion~
A battle-scarred, ebon-coated stallion stamps at the ground here.~
   Standing around nineteen hands high, this well-bred warhorse 
maintains a proud and dignified bearing, its muscled form with 
feathered-forelock and thick hooves obviously designed for 
warfare not the plow. Shiny, black intelligent eyes look about 
its surroundings, though loud noise of sudden movement of rider 
does little to displace the attention of this well-trained beast. 
A shiny, full mane and tail, and a soft coat of well-brushed ebon 
black hide give the powerful form of this animal a graceful air. 
Battle scars crisscross this horse's flanks and chest, lending a 
lifetime of experience to his appearance.

a thoroughly hairy auburn haired man~
A thoroughly hairy auburn haired man stands here.~
   Hairy is the first and foremost word that comes to mind upon 
spotting this man - his head, face, and the when visible nearly 
every other part of his body is covered in the same curly auburn 
coif. Undernearth his heavy beard a slightly crooked smile sits 
during the man's often boisterous displays of emotion - good and 
bad. Pale robin-egg blue eyes sit under his thick caterpillar 
brow, though little else is visible of his facial features. Tall 
and thickly built, the man seems rather solidly made.

Howell slim honey bearded man xNahar_NPCx MW_CAO~
a slim, honey-bearded man~
A slim, honey-bearded man stands at attention here.~
   Hair the color of wheat tops this man's head, generally kept 
in a loose knot at the nape of his neck, otherwise ending just 
below his shoulders in thick waves. Bushy brows and barely 
visible lashes of a matching, light color top dark eyes that peer 
out at the world keenly, framing either side of a sharp nose. 
Fleshy lips are partially hidden behind the honey-colored beard 
that covers his chin. He is tall, perhaps the one factor that 
gives his body the appearance of being thick with muscle rather 
than just overly large.

A tall, wheat-haired woman is present, marking down the rations delievered to the Granary on a slate board upon the wall.~
Alternating between sitting on a small stool in front of the Granary building, or doing work around the building, this tall, wheat-haired woman carefully counts and collects the the rations brought in by citizens. A large black slate board sitting next to her stool shows hatch marks in columns, a simple yet effective method of keeping records. She has a small stack of coins at hand, offering a fair price for needed foodstuffs.

A strong-backed, roan-colored stallion stands here, tail flicking.~
   This proud stallion, young and bordering on fiery tempered 
flicks his tail back and forth whenever he is steady, his sleek 
featured head held erect and ears perk. Roan colored, this horse 
has a short, glossy coat, with obvious signs of careful care and 
regular brushing. A few speckles of white dot his rump, left 
ear, and right forelock. Muscular with a strong back and 
shoulders and large furry hooves, this horse obviously stems from 
Graehim ancestry, carefully bred for war, rather than the plow.

a large horse-drawn cart~
A large wooden cart is here, pulled along by a massive draft horse.~
   Intended for the transport of goods, this cart has been 
fashioned from sturdy oak planking and has been reinforced with 
thick iron bands for strength and durability. Made with double 
axles of sanded wood, it bears four wood-spoked wheels. The 
curvatures of the wooden wheels are wrapped in iron banding that 
has been formed with light studding for traction in uncivilized 
terrain. Its boxy shape left open at the top, twin railings have 
been secured to either side, and between them, a large draft 
horse, a mottled brown in color, has been hitched, providing 
movement to this transport. Decently well groomed, the enormous 
horse is obviously used for labor rather then riding, his body 
stout and thickly muscled, with a plait-braided mane of dark 
black sweeping over his right shoulder. A small bench has been 
constructed towards the front of the cart, leaving space for a 
driver and a companion to sit beside.

An overly large, imposing man looms here.~
   This overly large man carries an imposing air about him, 
standing tall enough that he would need to dip his head to most 
doorways. Barrel chested with large broad shoulders. sinewy 
muscles rippling across his body. His visage is gaunt, showing 
weather weary lines of aged traveling. His heavily weathered and 
tanned skin suggest a long life of traveling and exposure to the 
raw elements. His hair is kept cut short, with speckled strands 
of silver accenting his once youthfully dark brown hair in a salt 
and pepper fashion. big bushy brows frame his aged pale blue 
eyes. His hands are thick and calloused, the mark of a hard 
laborious life.

A husky young lad tends the shop here, his hair sun-bleached.~
   At first glance, this young boy looks like he should be the 
size of a man almost twice his age. His husky stature moves with 
deliberate and powerful motions, betraying a great deal of muscle 
behind each mound of flesh. His sky-blue eyes are placed over 
rounded, freckled cheeks and thick, blushed lips that will easily 
curve in to a smile, betraying his youth. A sun-bleached crop of 
hair is matted upon his head, stray locks occasionally falling in 
to his eyes.

Caraneleth Cara cinereous woman with red young woman ember seregon caren~
a cinereous-eyed woman with red hair~
A cinereous-eyed woman with red hair is here.~
   This woman seems to use her abbreviated height to her 
advantage, often carrying herself in a manner intended to attract 
the least amount of attention, though it does not entirely 
eclipse her proud posture. Her hair hangs below her shoulders 
when unbound, and the color of it is just a few shades redder 
than outright blonde. A few streaks of grey have begun to show 
themselves already, unlikely brought on by age as she seems to be 
only in her mid-twenties. Her eyes are the color of ashes, 
surrounded by light lashes, and centered by a thin nose that 
appears to have been broken at least once. Faint freckles 
sprinkle the lines of her cheekbones, and her full lips are dark 
in contrast with her skin, which is strikingly pale enough to be 
notable without seeming sickly. The left side of her face is 
marred by a light pattern of scarring, and similar patterns can 
be seen on nearly every visible part of her skin. Her body is 
compact, clearly feminine but overlaid with wiry musculature, 
though there does seem to be a delicateness about her small 
limbs.

Aderyn weedy man narrow face xNahar_NPCx MW_CAO~
a weedy man with a narrow face~
A weedy man with a narrow face is here.~
   Blond hair tops this mans head, cropped closely against his 
skull. His eyes are a bit beady, but a bright crystal blue, set 
evenly on either side of a rather large nose. His lips are thin 
and bloodless, crudely split by an old scar that stretches from 
his temple to the center of his chin. His teeth, when revealed, 
are uneven and just a few short of a full set. His height could 
be considered imposing, but his long, thin limbs merely give him 
a stretched look.

Deowyth stocky auburn haired man xNahar_NPCx MW_CAO~
a stocky, auburn haired man~
A stocky, auburn haired man is here.~
   This man is of medium height, with broad shoulders and 
lightly-muscled limbs. His auburn hair hangs to about 
ear-length, bordering a face that is tanned and weathered, 
bearing a number of scars. Laugh lines linger near the corners 
of his dark brown eyes and narrow mouth. His gait is a bit 
uneven, but his hands are notably steady in whatever tasks he 
puts them to.

Dillian stout brutish brute pale fair man xNahar_NPCx MW_CAO~
a stout and brutish fair-haired man~
A pale skinned brute of a man is stood here.~
   This man's features are stern and twisted by scarring and the 
general idle, irritant demeanor often taken to his face. The 
right half of his face is slack for the most part, and carries 
severe burn scars. His right shoulder and the lower part of his 
neck carries similar, if more severe looking, old burns. A few 
licks of flame had licked over his bicep on that half. His frame 
is stout, and thick, and weight is generally piled on, core to 
limbs. Iron cords of muscle stand out in his neck, and strong, 
sturdy legs support his mass. Starkly fair hair spills down from 
his skull, held up in a half dozen or so braids. Thick calluses 
are built upon each of his hands, under the fingers prominent, 
but most of it in general just seems to be layered in tough skin.
