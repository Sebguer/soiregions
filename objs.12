rock large cairn black moss STONE~
a large, moss-encrusted rock~
A large, moss-encrusted rock rises from the dank ground in the centre of the isle.~
   This monolith of dark, igneous rock lurches from the soggy 
ground at a slight angle, leaning towards the south-east as it 
climbs from the soft terrain of this tiny island. A thick layer 
of grey, flaking moss covers the lower half of this rock, rough 
to the touch, whilest a number of skeletal plants cluster about 
its base. A small hole is noticeable at the south-eastern base 
of the pillar, perhaps just large enough for one to squeeze 
through.

a necklace of engraved scrimshaw beads~
A small bundle of off-white beads lies here.~
   A thin, heavily tarnished silver chin of crude workmanship 
threads through a series of a dozen large spherical beads 
fashioned from scrimshaw. The smooth surface of the beads is 
broken only by the simple engravings of stylized waves - while 
the design is plain, the meticulous and precise detail of which 
the countless repetition of the symbol occurs in. The cumulative 
effect is quite aesthetic, and the piece is rather prominent in 
size.

a small, battered, iron flask~
A small iron flask, rather beaten and battered, lies here.~
   Small enough to fit comfortably in one's hand, this flask has 
been through some heavy use and adverse conditions, if the 
battered, scratched and bent iron metal that forms it is any 
indication. Roughly rectangular in shape, a small metal cap sits 
securely upon the mouthpiece of the flask.

a towering, weed-wrapped statue of a hunched figure~
A towering statue of a hunched figure lurches from the midst of the isle, wrapped in dark weeds.~
   Lurching at a slight angle from the boggy land of the isolated 
isle, this towering statue still extends above the heads of all 
but the tallest of men. A thick layer of dark weeds has wrapped 
itself about the figure of the statue, obscuring all the shape of 
a hunched figure perched over some unknown object. Towards the 
base of the statue, the weeds loosen their tenacious hold, 
glimpses of a dull, white stone visible, pocked with many marks 
and colonies of moss. On the eastward side of the figure, just 
above the damp ground, a faint inscription can be seen past the 
moss and weeds.

petrified-trolls swamp_unique five_troll_stand trolls moss weeds figures stone STONE~
one of the petrified, moss-shrouded trolls~
Five looming figures of stone, shrouded in moss and lashed with weeds, rise up from the dark soil of the trail.~
   Towering well over the heads of the tallest of men, these five 
massive figures of stone are arranged in a rough semi-circle 
about the trail, the gaps between them allowing one to easily 
pass through them in order to progress further along the path. A 
closer examination of the moss-shrouded, weed-lashed statues 
reveals decidedly troll like features carved into the stone, each 
one fashioned that its massive fists are raised back, as if to 
strike some target on the ground between them. The detail of the 
work is nothing less than astonishing, with every foul pore and 
jagged, broken tooth masterfully depicted on the snarling mouths 
of the brutish trolls.

a pitted stone pillar~
A pitted stone pillar rises up a short distance from the crude, masonry scattered about its base.~
   Square cut stone, a dusty grey in hue, rises up several feet
from the firm ground of the trail leading through the swamp. 
There is little adornment about the structure, instead simply 
being of solid build. The stone surface of the pillar is heavily 
pitted, and vines and moss grow freely about it. Loose blocks, 
the same stone as they which the pillar has been fashioned from, 
lay about the base, choked in weeds and fungi.

a massive, gnarled willow~
A massive, gnarled willow dominates the island, branches drooping down over the thick roots that run rampant over the ground.~
   This willow tree is as ancient as they come, its wood hard as 
steel and of a dusky, brown color. Moss and lichen grow freely 
along it, and the occasional insect can be seen to crawl across 
its massive frame, yet the tree seems to have survived such pests 
with little bending or bowing.

a low, uneven fence of piled stones~
A low, uneven fence of piles stones runs a short distance from north to south, a narrow gap set near the centre.~
   This rough fence has been formed of simple stones piled atop 
one another, the structure seemingly held in place by the thick 
weeds that snake between each stone. It is curiously low, coming 
only to the knees of an average sized man, the bottom stones 
somewhat covered by the soft earth of the heathland.

A low structure, an uneven surface of lichen-inhabited rocks, rises up from the tall grass of a hillock here.~
   Emerging from the tall, uncut grass that roams across much of 
the heathland here is a large surface of stones, somewhat flat 
yet with many uneven rocks jutting out or missing, their place 
taken by wildly growing weeds. Between every crack in this stone 
foundation is a thick wedge of lichen, a dull green bordering 
upon grey in colour.

Sunken into the soft ground of the heathland here is a slanted cottage, the roof missing.~
   The stone walls of this cottage have sunk to some degree 
beneath the surface of the boggy ground here, the eastern wall in 
particularly covered in scraggly vegetation. The roof is long 
gone, rotted wooden slates set across the length of the building. 
An opening set low to the ground allows those determined enough 
to squeeze inside.

   Large enough to have once stored many livestock and crops, 
this somewhat ruined barn is of little more use. A massive tree 
has smashed through the lower end of the structure, shattering 
the roof and tilting the building upwards. The doorway lies open 
at the northern, upwards end, and a short climb is required to 
enter the remains of the barn.

A towering rock lurches forth from the boggy wetlands here, its surface free of lichen or moss and instead covered in spiralling carvings.~
   Of dark igneous type, this rock towers over the heads of men, 
perhaps even trolls, as it lurches from the boggy ground here. A 
series of small bushes grow about it, but none seem too large, 
the ground about it of soft dirt instead of the usual knee-high 
grass of the heathland. Intricate carvings of spiraling swirls 
of no particular shape or pattern adorn the rock, the work only 
covering the lower half of the monolith.

all weighed down by many slim little green leaves that give
the tree a distinctly weepy appearance. Some of the leaves
actually brush the ground, the branches are so long.

point. Much of the surface is covered in rust, but some detail 
work is visible. A dragon's head, partially covered by rust has 
been engraved into the shoulder plate, and it is positioned so 
that the spikes appear to be its horns.

Several golden pegs hold tight the strings that run down the

the vicious V-shaped slit, the pointed metallic chin allows for a 
particularly imposing armored visage.

be worn over the shoulder. Under the horn on a bronze plaque,

   An oddity of craftsmanship, this mask has been crafted out of 
the best materials. Akin to a snake's visage, it has been 
systematically covered in thin oyster shells and ebon 
mother-of-pearl. Carefully, thin slits have been cut and molded, 
to create otherworldly, slanted eyes. Large canine teeth are 
expertly set into the mouth, and display somewhat of a snarl. A 
upraised ridge of what looks to be bone forms an oversized brow, 
complimenting the ominous glare of serpentine eyes.

A massively-slashed, rotted robe covered in caked blood lays here.~
   The original color of this robe is lost in the stains of filth 
and blood that cover its entire surface. While several large 
gashes are rent in it in various places, it is the huge, gaping 
slash mark over the chest that draws the attention. The entire 
front of this ancient robe is covered in dried, caked blood 
barely decipherable from the other black stains of dirt that 
cover it. The hem, sleeves, and other fringe pieces of the item 
are frayed to threads, the entire item looking nigh ready to 
disintegrate from age and overuse.

A blood- and filth-smeared gold brooch bearing an open tome lays here.~
   Once an item of supreme craftsmanship, the glimmer of this 
gold brooch has been subdued by the caked blood that covers its 
emblem and the general black filth, mud, and blood that seems to 
have settled on it. Dangling from the chain of the brooch is an 
open tome, barely decipherable at all beneath the corruption and 
defilement. The intricate metalwork that once depicted the 
fanned-out pages and tiny writing has, however, been finally worn 
away by age and harsh surroundings.

A thick cuirass of lobstered-plates lies here~
   This heavy cuirass is masterfully crafted of a half-dozen 
bands of thick, bladed iron that wrap horizontally around the 
chest and back of the wearer. They are arranged to slide over 
each other easily, giving a solid wall of protection. On the 
shoulders sit a pair of thick, barb-lined pauldrons, and the 
inside of the breastplate is lined with sweat stained fur and 
leather, to give some added degree of protection from the blunt 
force of attacks. The entire array as been fire-blackened and 
secured with thick bolts, making it a formidable example of 
yrkish armor.
