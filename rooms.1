Before the Great Gates of Minas Tirith~
   Rising here indomitably, like immovable pillars, are the Great 
Gates of Minas Tirith. Two immense, magnificent gates of heavy 
iron are hung on steel posts that are, in and of themselves, over 
a foot in diameter. Between a massive, magnificently carved, and 
obviously ancient stone arch, the gates meet together so 
perfectly, one would not even be able to slip a parchment between 
or beneath them. To the north and south, the dark wall of the 
city curves gently through Mount Mindolluin, whilst to the east, 
the road stretches to the horizon, toward the Great Crossing and 
beyond.

   Rising up out of the darkness here, like immovable pillars, 
are the Great Gates of Minas tirith. Two immense, magnificent 
gates of heavy iron are hung on steel posts that are, in and of 
themselves, over a foot in diameter. Just outside the gates, set 
on either side of the magnificently carved, massive stone arch, 
are a good few lamp-posts, constantly burning their oils during 
the night. Set on the inside of the gates, on either side, are 
lanterns mounted to the walls, providing even more light. The 
gates themselves meet so perfectly, one would not even be able to 
slip a parchment between or beneath them. To the north and the 
south, the wall of the city curves gently through Mount 
Minodulluin, snaking into the darkness, whilst to the east, the 
road stretches into the darkness, to the barely-visible Great 
Crossing and beyond.

A Long, Sloping Ramp~
   Rising gently from the second ring to the third, and vice 
versa, this ramp allows easy travel for the plethora of carts and 
commoners that are constantly upon its cobbled surface. Heading 
northeast to the rather squalid second circle, and southwest to 
the well-kept, merchant-filled third circle, a number of guards 
are never far from the gates here, watching with an unsurpassed 
scrutiny at the throngs of civilians.

Rath Mal'Rina~
   This short, well-kept street leads through the third circle, 
home to many an upper-class merchant, artisan, and crafter. The 
white stone walls of the buildings arch upward toward the sky, 
each at least two stories. A heavy contingent of guards patrol 
all the streets. 
   The grayish cobblestone street is worn and cracked, but kept 
clean from all debris. Small trees and well-groomed shrubs line 
the way, and in between these, tall, glass-enclosed street lamps 
have been set into the stone, large enough to provide ample light 
during the evening hours. A massive, squarish building with a 
heavy, iron door leads of to the west, a silverish plaque above 
the door.

A Guard Post~
   This clean, spartanly furnished room only holds the bare 
necessities. A few cots and two desks occupy the western wall, 
while parchments and inkwells lie strewn about haphazardly. 
   The southern wall is comprised of weapon racks overflowing 
with swords, spears and the like, while wooden dummies sport 
excess armor. The northern wall consists of a small, stone 
fireplace, providing the guards a place to keep warm and to 
prepare food. The stone floor is covered in a deep red rug, 
adding a bit of warmth to this otherwise cold room. A heavy, 
iron door lies to the east.

Junction of Rath Sinth~
   A pattern laid out in grey, black and white cobblestones bears 
the weight of the crowds of people and wagons that move on past 
in this junction of the mighty street of Rath Sinth. Not far to 
the north rests a small guardtower, rising above the 
stone-and-wood buildings that line the street. Roads run off to 
the north, east, and west here. Rath Sinth breaks into its 
western and eastern sects while Rath Mal'Rina progresses, 
although very shortly, north. To the south stands a large 
tavern, a metal sign hanging above the door displaying an 
engraved iron dagger.

The Spinning Dagger~
   Floored in light gray and blackish cobblestone, three stairs 
lead down into the main commons of the Spinning Dagger. People 
flock to this establishment at all times of night and day, 
chattering, and gossiping over their favorite brew. A square, 
open-centered bar sits in the center of the room, stools 
surrounding it, and empty tankards hung above it. Clean, white 
walls lead up to the ceiling, crossed at the top with light pine 
beams. 
   An engraved, iron dagger is set above the two northern doors, 
leading out to the crossroads of Rath Mal'Rina and Rath Sinth, 
two skinny glass windows on either side.

The Plaza of the Sun Inside the Gates~
   An open marketplace full of vendors, the Plaza of the Sun is a 
rather large parkplace of gleaming white cobblestones near the 
looming gates of Minas Tirith. Smells waft through the area, 
ranging from tanned hide to charcoal to cooked chicken. The 
Plaza seems meticulously well-kept, a testament to the City's 
splendor. Many of the citizens of the First Circle of Minas 
Tirith, along with visitors to the White City, wander their way 
amongst the bustling crowds and vendors of the plaza to buy 
goods. 
   Carriages roll through the Great Gates here, journeying to 
Wardogs in the Pelennor or just west of Cair Andros across the 
river from Amdir where the Army of Gondor is based.

The Center of the Plaza of the Sun~
   A rather large open marketplace filled with transient vendors 
of all sorts of goods, the Plaza of the Sun lies at the heart of 
the First Circle of Minas Tirith, just to the west of the gates. 
Citizens from all over the White City gather here to do their 
day's shopping, whilst farmers, trappers, skinners, and fishermen 
bring their goods from the wilderness, hawking both them and 
their prices loudly. The marketplace continues in all 
directions, eventually leading along a roadway north and south, 
and out the gates to the east. 
   A large area of the plaza has been cleared of tents and 
traders, a raised platform prepared and fine buntings and 
pennants hung from every home and tower surrounding this area.

Large Collection of Merchant Caravans~
   Stretching far and wide, this marketplace is filled with the 
cacophony of a million different sounds. Vendors hawk their 
wares and haggle endlessly with their buyers. The clickety-clack 
of wains being driven across the flawless white cobblestones 
combines with the rattling of guards above on the city's outer 
wall. The marketplace continues in every other direction. 
   Rising to the West an ancient gate sits guarding a portico 
entrance leading up to the Second Circle. 
   Merchant caravans frequently stop here to collect the goods 
sold in the Great Market at the beginning of each months, to ship 
it off to far away parts of Gondor and beyond. 
   A heavy cedar sign hangs over the western door etched with a 
fully outfitted caravan.

The Northwestern Corner of the Plaza~
   An open marketplace filled with transient vendors, the Plaza 
of the Sun offers a peer into the diversity of Minas Tirith. 
Numerous people ranging from beggars to peasants to porters to 
the occasional quasinoble pass by, some pausing to argue with the 
merchants of the Plaza. Throngs of people wade by at all times, 
day and night, on the white cobblestones of the Plaza. A door 
opens northwards to a small clothing shop. This small section 
seems to be much more likely to hold those with little social 
standing. A sea-green-trimmed stall has been erected here, 
numerous bins, crates, racks and shelves linings its walls with a 
variety of goods on display.

The Northeastern Corner of The Plaza~
   This ancient Plaza is a major thoroughfare that was built for 
peasant and noble, pauper and lord to walk upon. The 
cobblestones, though somewhat rough, are well-worn through 
centuries of use. To the southeast lie the Great Gates of Minas 
Tirith, while the large market known as the Plaza of the Sun 
continues both south and west.

The Garden Market Buyers, Near the Borough Council Office~
   A series of ridge and bell-shaped tents dominate the market 
gardeners area of the great market. Racks of tools and pallet 
boards of agricultural and horticultural seeds are stacked within 
the open-sided tents. Farmers and the gardeners of wealthy 
nobles mix with casual shoppers, all browsing this neat and 
orderly area. 
   An official-looking building is visible not far to the south, 
lining the southwestern edge of the plaza.

The Southern End of the Plaza~
   Here, the wide and open Plaza of the Sun combines with the 
narrower path of Rath Celerdain, the Lampwright's Street. A 
veritable swarm of people pass by at all times, bantering with 
one another as they move about their business. The cobbled 
marketplace, the Plaza of the Sun, continues in all directions 
but south, where the white cobblestones of Rath Celerdain streak 
off on their path to Second Circle.

The Farmer's Meat Market Buyers Near a Tavern and Army Office~
   The old Lampwright's street, Rath Celerdain, bends here, 
heading off to the north and west. The sounds and smells of a 
busy marketplace originate from the northwest. To the south lies 
a double-story building, the lower floor constructed of stone 
whilst the upper of wood. To the east lies a double-story tavern 
with a slate-tiled roof. The street continues to the north 
toward the city gates, as well as to the west. 
   Set before the door in the building to the south are two flags 
hanging off ash posts, bearing the Tree of Gondor embroidered 
upon a dark green background. To the east, the doors open to the 
well-known Battered Shield tavern.

A Crowded Battalion Recruitment Office~
   Whilst its furnishings and construction are far from opulent, 
this room has an air of spartan efficiency to it, designed for a 
clear-cut purpose. The stone walls are kept clean of soot and 
grime, and two lanterns set on iron brackets illuminate the 
office throughout the night when light finishes entering the room 
through the two shutters set in the northern wall. 
   Throughout the day, soldiers of Lord Eradan's Battalion move 
swiftly in and out through the thick, oaken doors set in the 
northern, western, and southern walls. In the office itself, 
military clerks are taking down the names of volunteers who come 
in and inquire about signing up for the honor of serving Gondor. 
   Please "#3join up#0" to become a soldier today and be taken to 
Amdir, home of the northern Army of Gondor.

Under Meneldil Gate~
   Delved into the rocky slope of Mount Mindolluin, Meneldil Gate 
leads into the fourth circle of Minas Tirith, and is named after 
one of the sons of Anarion, ancient King of Gondor. The light of 
the sun is pale here, but coal braziers and torches set into the 
granite walls provide sufficient illumination. The massive iron 
gate is safely guarded at all times by the grim guardsmen of the 
city guard, who grant passage into a rich residential area and

Rath Meneldil~
   This road is clean and well maintained, obviously as the 
result effort and great attention from the citizens of this part 
of the city. Named after one of the sons of Anarion, an ancient 
King of Gondor, the road is paved by tightly fitting slabs of 
grey granite, and is constantly travelled by the citizens of Minas 
Tirith. Statues of grim warriors and stern rulers of the past 
occasionally line the edges of the road, to remind those who pass 
by them of the glory and tradition of the fair city. 
   To the south rises Meneldil Gate, the only passage through the 
impenetrable walls of the fourth circle. West, a small building 
with painted windows looks over the street, the sounds of merry 
song and laughter echoing from the inside.

Rath Celerdain, South of the Plaza~
   The ancient cobblestones, once rough but now worn smooth by 
centuries of travel, make a fine pathway through the heart of the 
fair city of Minas Tirith. Lain during a glorious past, Rath 
Celerdain is the circuit that is the first line of defense for 
the city. The ever-watchful guards on the city walls above 
provide a sense of security and safety. The street continues to 
the north and the south. A sign hangs above the eastern door showing
the markings of the Leathercrafter Guild.

gentle and graceful curve from northeast to southwest and vice 
versa around the First Circle of the city. The clean-swept and 
well-kept cobblestones, though worn smooth over the years, retain 
their pearly-white luster with an almost disconcerting splendor.

The Old Guest House~
   A well-established inn and tavern, the Old Guest House has a 
long history of bedding the guests of Minas Tirith. Several long 
wooden tables line the room, many filled with patrons and 
guardsmen alike, taking a break from their daily routine. No 
matter the time of day, it is assured that a hot meal and a cozy 
bed await the patrons of this inn. The east wall is punctuated 
by a large fireplace, in which a flame blazes without ceasing, 
providing warmth for the cold and dryness for the rain-soaked. 
The stairs leading up end at an ornately-trimmed door, and the 
door to the west leads back to the street.

beyond an iron-reinforced door, is a large battlement, ever used 
by the hawkish eyes of the Minas Tirith Guard. Rath Celerdain,

buildings. A notable building to the west, made of white stone, 
bears a series of bronze plaques upon the wall, each depicting

On the Lower Level of a Battlement~
   This is a notched parapet that protrudes from the city wall, 
providing a place for guards to watch during times of peace, and 
for archers to use in times of war. The slabs of white rock that 
compose the parapet have been skillfully cut, providing a solid

On Top of the Battlement~
   The raging attacks of unknown foes have been witnessed from 
this battlement. The alternating merlons and crenels are marked 
and chipped by many a deadly, poison-laced missile of orcish 
craft. From this point, it is possible to see for many miles 
across the Pelennor Fields, stretching out endlessly. There is a 
narrow set of stairs that runs down to a lower battlement.

On Rath Celerdain~
   The ancient and majestic street of Rath Celerdain stretches 
forth here, causeway for peasant and noble alike to tread upon. 
Far to the north, beneath the magnificent embrasure hundreds of 
feet above, lies the Plaza of the Sun; regardless of what time, 
day or night, one can constantly hear folks shouting prices and 
haggling, even at this distance. To the south, the street begins 
to curve around, following the guide of the great wall of Minas 
Tirith. 
   Though it is somewhat dingier along the southern than it is 
nearer to the Sun Plaza, the Rath certainly sees enough upkeep to 
make the area liveable.

At a Turn in Rath Celerdain~
   Rath Celerdain, the old Lampwright's Street, bends here, from 
the north to the west and vice versa. Above, guards pace 
vigilantly upon parapets and bastions on the city walls, keeping 
eternal watch over this fair city. The cobblestones of Rath 
Celerdain show more wear here than elsewhere; although they 
retain their ivory hues, they are worn down and cracked in 
places, with weeds sprouting between them.

Street, continues to stretch gently around the perimeter of the
first ring of the city. To the north of the street lies a
slightly haggard weaver's shop. Every now and then a gull flies
overhead, having strayed from the mighty Anduin, which lies to
the east and south. The street continues to the south and east.

Rath Celerdain, Beside a Wooden Building~
   The pearly-cobblestoned street continues on throughout the 
fair city of Minas Tirith, a wooden building standing tall to the 
west. An old sign with a weatherworn inscription hangs above the 
door, swinging freely in any breeze. The Lampwright's Street, 
Rath Celerdain, continues endlessly to the north and south, 
causeway for the many people on its surface at any time. The 
humans and their mounts are not the only creatures on the street, 
however: a number of gulls have assembled to pick apart and feast 
upon the garbage near the western door.

shop, are piled high with the silvery, succulent fish pulled each

fish heads.

Rath Celerdain, North of a Guard Tower~
   On a generally straight section, the fair causeway of Rath 
Celerdain, also known as the Lampwright's Street, continues its 
circuit of First Circle. Toward the east, it curves toward the 
Great Gates of Minas Tirith. Caught between the turret of great 
wall and the first circle's walls, the street here is too narrow 
to accommodate any buildings, though still comfortable enough for 
the never-ending throng of people who mill about on their daily

provide a great deal of light during the evening hours of the 
night. The street continues to the east and to the south. All

A Battlement on the Southeastern Part of the City~
   This battlement was created to allow the guard to stand before 
the enemy in times of war, providing a height advantage, so that 
heated mixtures of oil and tar, as well as deadly arrows might be 
rained down upon the enemy's head. The battlement is large 
enough for several men to stand upon, and can be entered from 
either the north or west, from Rath Celerdain.

Rath Celerdain, West of a Guard Tower~
   Squeezing between the outer wall of Minas Tirith and the door 
of a shop, the cobblestones of the Lampwright's Street, Rath 
Celerdain, immediately loses its pearly luster the further south 
one goes. The cobblestones, when visible beneath the omnipresent 
grime and the heaps of mishandled pottery and rotten food, are a 
dull, drab bone-grey here. Most of the numerous citizens who 
mull along the road seem to be quite adapted to the area, grime 
all over their bodies and the plethora of smells that is Minas 
Tirith wafting around them, from perfume to animal offal to the 
sweet smell of Westmansweed, sold in the shop to the west. A 
reinforced door lies up a flight of stairs, to the east.

   This is a rustic building that seems in an eternal state of 
disarray. Crudely-constructed wooden bins fill almost every bit 
of wall space, being piled high with pungent, sloppily-rolled 
Westmansweed. The sweet smell of this herb, known in other parts 
as pipeweed, hangs hazily in this building. Although the strain 
of Westmansweed sold here is inferior to that which is grown in 
other parts of Middle Earth, it still appears to be quite good.

Rath Celerdain Bends West and North~
   Becoming a little more worn with every step southwest one 
takes, Rath Celerdain conversely regains its splendor some ways 
to the northeast. Here, however, the grandiose roadway retains 
little of its majesty, buried beneath puddles of water and the 
offal of mounted beasts. The latter create a stench like none 
other, as wretched flies gather for the feast. To the northeast, 
the eternal, winding Rath Celerdain continues snaking its way 
around the city, while to the southwest, it moves to eventually 
intersect Merchant's Way.

   The earthy smell of Middle-earth's fruit can be perceived 
here, as legumes of almost every type have been carted in to this 
farmer's produce tent. The olive canvas of the tent seems to 
serve well as protection from the elements, having been coated 
thickly with a resin of some kind. Bushel baskets sit on top of 
crudely-constructed tables, all but groaning under their weight. 
The tent's only flap leads out to the south.

   Eastward lies an extended plaza, a junction of three streets. 
From it leads out Western Rath Sinth, leading now to the 
north-west through the fine residences of wealthy landowners and 
merchants of Minas Tirith. Arranged in patterns of geometric 
shapes are the grey and black paving stones of Rath Sinth, worn 
down from countless years of use. Tastefully constructed houses 
rest to the north and south of the street, and a row of trees 
extends before them. Oil lamps from atop high iron posts dispel 
the shadows of night through this section of the third circle as 
Western Rath Sinth extends out westwards.

hardware. The walls here are delicately fashioned of whitewashed 
stone, the ceiling vaulted high above, held aloft by heavily 
adorned buttresses, and bound with the chain of a brilliant 
crystal chandelier. The floor is fashioned of marble tile, 
alternating in a pattern of smoky grey and inky black, and bound 
with immaculate white grout. The eastern and western walls are 
hung with a pair of beautiful velvet tapestries, bearing the 
emblem of the Merchant House of Sindbar - a spread-winged azure 
falcon set over a many-speared red sun. Furniture is 
strategically placed about the enclosure, kept clear of the 
southern walkway as it exits into a large room in that direction.

Grey and Black Cobbles of Northwestern Rath Sinth~
   Tall buildings fashioned from wood, stone or a combination of 
the two progress from east to west, looking down on the street of 
Rath Sinth. Behind the buildings to the south stands the wall to 
the fourth circle of Minas Tirith, dwarfing any other structure 
visible to the eye. Passing through the newer stone buildings 
and the older timber residences is the cobbled street itself, 
dusty and worn paving stones running to the east and west. A 
pattern has been formed from black and grey rock in the 
cobblestones, yet its features paid little attention by the well 
dressed people that move past. 
   To the north stand the double doors of a large warehouse, and 
a solid iron gate leads south into a large estate.

four directions, many different sized crates piled and stacked up 
against them. Objects of every imaginable sort line the racks 
and stack atop the shelves, neatly stacked, and kept in good 
order. 
A large, stone archway stands into the southern wall, leading

seen lining the street through here. A pattern of alternating 
grey and black cobblestones runs underfoot to the human traffic 
that walks by, finely clothed men and women walking alongside 
those dressed for the more practical matters of daily living and 
commerce. A line of trees runs in front of the fine stone houses 
that line Rath Sinth to the east and west, a row of regularly 
placed lamp posts illuminating the area from in front of them. 
   Rath Sinth approaches a bend in its progress as it runs to the

buildings of this section of Minas Tirith. Rough circles and 
triangles have been etched into the road by the careful placement 
of black and grey cobblestones. A number of the stones lay

visible. A row of well-trimmed trees grows behind a line of 
cast-iron lamp posts, a display of wealth along this stretch of 
Western Rath Sinth.

   Up-class stone and wood buildings run parallel to the street of 
Rath Sinth, glass windows and shutters gazing down from the 
second levels of many of them onto the grey cobbles of the road 
below. A multitude of people pass on by, the tread of boots and 
shoes upon stone mingling in the air with soft conversations. A 
break in the row of opulent houses to the south reveals a lush 
garden, a twisting black-cobbled path leading down into the open 
space. Behind the shaded sward looms up the wall to the fourth 
circle of Minas Tirith. 
   East and west Rath Sinth runs, continuing its journey through 
the third circle.

Northwestern Rath Sinth South of a Large Townhouse~
   The noise and bustle of Rath Sinth echoes through the area 
here across the grey cobblestones, cracked by countless years of 
bearing the weight of the population of the third circle of Minas 
Tirith. South of the street, a neat row of carefully tended 
trees runs in front of the well-constructed buildings, a break in 
the line for the doors and entrances. Tall iron lamp posts, the 
burning oil at the top caged in glass, shine down light on the 
opposite side of Rath Sinth to the greenery, granting vision at 
night for the people of the city that pass by. 
   Rath Sinth continues to the west and east, and a large, 
two-story house rises up to the north. The door is decorated by 
an elaborate painting of two partially over-lapping golden coins, 
and a green tassle swinging over the coins in a partial spiral.

   Running west and east, cobblestones ranging from black to

Sinth. During the day, shoppers and merchants flock toward their 
destinations, whether it be shop or home, filling the street with 
chatter and gossip. Neatly tended shrubs and ancient trees line 
the road on both sides, growing in serene beauty withing well 
cared for yards and gardens. Tall, glass lanterns stand silently 
near the roadside, lit each night to ensure an everlasting 
twilight. 
   To the south, a pathway breaks off from the road and leads 
through a small, grassy yard toward a two-story house.

Western Rath Sinth~
   Rath Sinth deadends here at the steep sides of the mountain 
the city was built upon. The buildings themselves fade right 
into the mountainside, fading from white to greys and blacks 
without much notice.

A Shaded Sward~
   Overshadowed by an ancient, drooping willow, a small, winding 
cobblestone path leads south off Western Rath Sinth into a small 
garden, and to a stone patio. Well-tended shrubs zigzag 
alongside the path, small flowers blooming at their bases, 
offering an escape from the city view to one of serenity and 
beauty. Grassy knolls rise up to meet white rock walls to every 
side but the north and west, thick leafy vines running up the 
clean brick. A stone path leads west from a roundish, 
cobblestone patio that sits under the base of the tree, kept away 
from the eyes of passers-by through the busy streets of the 
business district.

A Shaded Sward~
   Winding into the garden from the east, then curving back to 
the north, a black and gray cobblestone path brushes up against 
neatly trimmed shrubs, and well-cared for blossoms. To the south 
and the west, large white walls rise skyward, a few leafy vines 
creeping up their sides. Near the stone walls, grassy areas 
slope downward toward the north, allowing an easy view of 
Western Rath Sinth, and the people who bustle about them 
throughout the day.

Common Room of Wardogs Tavern~
   Covered with battered and broken weapons and armor, the 
once-white walls of this tavern have been slightly blackened over 
the years with smoke and age. A few tables rest on top the 
wooden floor, each crafted from old armor and shields. Near the 
southern wall, a long wooden step leads to a dark wooden bar, a 
few cushioned stools lined in front. Against the western wall, 
three padded booths offer patrons of this tavern somewhere to 
ease their bodies. A worn, iron chandelier hangs approximately 
in the center of the ceiling, casting a dim light, old helmets 
hanging from its tips. 
   The eastern wall is made of a thick, ornate curtain, 
occasional noises drifting through it, and north, a simple wooden 
door leads out onto Western Rath Sinth.

Northwestern Rath Sinth~
   Slate grey paving stones make up the street of Eastern Rath 
Sinth as it begins its stretch through the eastern half of the 
third circle of the city. To the west it ends in the junction of 
three streets, but leads on east. Numerous buildings, both 
residential and commercial sit along the street, the stores 
bearing goods of all shapes and sizes. Wagons and foot traffic 
pass through the street in heavy concentration, eager to be about 
their daily business throughout Minas Tirith. A row of lamps 
illuminate the street here in the darkest of nights.

Bend in Eastern Rath Sinth~
   This heavily traveled thoroughfare begins to enter the 
commerce area of Rath Sinth. Crowded with peoples of most races, 
most walk along easily, or stop to browse the many shops that 
line the way. The white stone walls of the surrounding 
buildings, some of which are carved intricately, arch gracefully 
skyward, making this road seem narrow in comparison. 
   The grayish cobblestones underfoot are cracked and worn in the 
center, apparently from the heavy amount of foot traffic, wagons, 
and horses that time has pulled through over the ages. Tall, 
glass-enclosed street lamps line the street, providing adequate 
light during the evening hours. Well groomed trees and shrubs 
also line the street, showing the care and wealth of this 
circle's populous. 
   The road gently curves here, running westward toward the 
residential area, and southward, deeper into the commerce 
section.

Eastern Rath Sinth~
   Running north and south, cobblestones ranging from black to 
light gray run underfoot, making up this stretch of Eastern Rath 
Sinth. During the day, shoppers and merchants flock towards 
their destinations, whether it be shop or home, filling the 
street with chatter and gossip. Neatly tended shrubs and ancient 
trees line the road on both sides, growing in serene beauty 
withing well cared for yards and gardens. Tall, glass lanterns 
stand silently near the roadside, lit each night to ensure an 
everlasting twilight.

Inside a Vinter's Supply Shoppe~
   Inside the spartan Vintner's Shoppe, the eternal heat is nigh 
unto unbearable due to a glowing kiln that sits in the northeast 
corner of the shop. Shelf upon shelf of handblown wine bottles 
wait to be purchased. A stone-topped workbench beside the kiln 
is littered with the implements of the trade. A thick, cotton 
apron lies rumpled in a heap, topped by two thicker mitts. In 
several large stacks, tied together by frayed rope, are large, 
inch-thick sheaves of cork ready to be pressed into stoppers for 
wine bottles. The only opening to the building is to the east.

The Weaver's Beam~
   Resembling a gigantic torture device, or at least an oversized 
spider, a weaver's loom fills the western half of this fabric 
house. Creating a finely-woven web of fabric spun from yarns and 
threads of all types, the loom is almost constantly in motion, as 
if the weaver were creating a tale, piecing it together bit by 
bit. Large bolts of cloth of various types lean against the 
eastern wall of the shop, ready for purchase by tailors. Broad 
cloths, twills, cotton fabrics, as well as woolen items are spun 
here. There is a squeaky door on the north end of the shop.

At a Bend in the Lampwright's Street~
   The old Lampwright's street, Rath Celerdain, bends here, from 
the north and west. Above, guards pace vigilantly upon parapets 
and bastions on the city walls, keeping eternal watch over this 
fair city. The ancient cobblestones are cracked and well-worn 
here, as if the iron-shod hooves of valiant battle horses have 
pulverized them. The street continues to the north as well as to 
the west.

At Massive Iron Gates~
   Massive iron gates rise up from the ground extending to the 
full height of the smooth white wall separating the lower circle 
from the one above. Both gates have smaller doors in them to 
facilitate ease of use. The road leading up to the gates is made 
of black stone carefully laid to provide a smooth ride for the 
mounted soldiers garrisoned beyond the gates. Torches planted in 
the ground stand here waiting to be lit when darkness begins to 
encroach upon the day. 
   The road leads south from here into the circle below.

Rath Celerdain, West of a Guard Parapet~
   Rising sharply above is the alabaster wall of the second ring 
of Minas Tirith, denying all those with evil intent. The city 
street here is broken up like carelessly handled pottery from the 
constant pounding of wagon wheels, creating two large ruts. To 
the north and south, the Lampwright's street continues without 
end. A small guard parapet overlooks the Pelennor Fields to the 
east.

Rath Celerdain Travels South and East~
   The ancient lamp-lined street of Rath Celerdain continues its 
progress here, stretching gently around the perimeter of the 
first ring of the city. The lamps along the edges provide a 
great deal of visibility in the nighttime hours, bathing the area 
in light. The stark contrast of the dull cobblestones against 
the numerous ivory-white-stone buildings that border the road 
bears testament to the amount of use the road sees every day. An 
equal testament is the ever-present dozen or so people walking 
along it at any given time in this particular section.

Inside the Perchemear's Shop~
   This rather kempt shop is the home for a parchment maker. All 
over the shop is the evidence of the parchment-making process. A 
workbench in the northeast corner of the shop is piled high with 
several layers of sheepskin waiting to be stripped from the grain 
for preparation in a bath of lime. Several drum-shaped 
stretching devices line the northern wall of the shop, as 
newly-made parchment is being dried for future use. A flatbed, 
wooden cabinet in the center of the store is filled with flat, 
mostly square pages of parchment and scrolls of vellum, ready to 
be sold.

East of the Perchemear's Shop on Rath Celerdain~
   As the Lampwright's Street continues true on its course around 
First Circle, it passes a small parchment-maker's shop, to the 
west. The well-kept shop features a large, wooden sign in the 
shape of a parchment scroll above the door. A trail of greyish 
powder leads toward the shop's ancient and battered door. Still, 
numerous people waltz by the shop on their daily business, a 
select and decidedly finer-dressed few occasionally entering it. 
Rath Celerdain, Lampwright's Street, continues north and south.

The Crowded Merchant's Way~
   Stretching almost as far as the eye can see to the west, the 
usually crowded Merchant's Way runs as straight as a weaver's 
beam. Bringing business from far and wide, it is a place where 
the necessities of life are bought and sold. The smell of food 
mingles with pipeweed smoke, blended with the sweet smell of 
leather, as well as fragrant perfumes crushed from flower petals. 
Rath Celerdain continues to the north.

On Merchant's Way~
   Merchant's Way has the air of a carnival, with merchants
hawking their wares from stands that are assembled, torn apart,
and moved elsewhere, almost as if they never existed. Cries of
angry bargain-hunters compete with the incessant haggling of
harried business owners. A nutseller's stand lies to the north,
its back to the wall of Second Circle, while a freestanding
ironsmith's stall has been erected towards the middle of
the path.

On the Wide Merchant's Way~
   Without a doubt, Merchant's Way is an event more than it is a 
place, with vendors from all walks of life gathering to sell 
their wares in hope of fulfilling their dreams. Most will do 
well to put bread and a bit of cheese on the table, but a few 
will doubtless gain that which holds them in thrall to pure 
avarice. To the north, a produce tent has been left deserted.

On Merchant's Way~
   Loud and bustling, Merchant's Way is easily the largest market 
of Minas Tirith, with merchants from all over Gondor hawking 
their wares from stands that vary from day to day. Trampling 
feet pound the dirty cobblestones at all times, and a cacophony 
of sounds pierce the air, ranging from the shouting of merchants 
to the rattling of wagon-wheels to the occasional clamor of 
mishandled goods unceremoniously crashing to the cobblestones. 
Merchant's Way continues east and west, while to the north, a 
featherman has erected a stand.

In the Middle of Merchant's Way~
   Located along the southern rim of the First Circle of Minas 
Tirith, the daily carnival of Merchant's Way is certainly the 
most crowded market of the city, and quite possibly the loudest. 
While most of the merchants and their would-be clientele are 
dressed in poor linens or sack-cloth rags, an occasional 
finely-dressed person wades through the sea of bodies, usually 
followed quite closely by a guard. The cobblestones of the 
market-road continue west and east, while along the wall to the 
north, the stall of an herb-seller stands.

On Merchant's Way~
   Long and wide, the ancient roadway known as Merchant's Way 
seems more like an elongated market than causeway for the common 
man. Filled with merchants, as well as bargain-hunters ever 
searching for their elusive quarry, the bustling Merchant's Way 
is a gathering place for all sorts of Minas Tirith's common folk. 
Though the occasional guard or well-dressed aristocrat 
occasionally wanders through, for the most part, the populace 
remain poorly-dressed, poorly groomed, and, mostly, unbathed.

Lord Yoar's Bridge~
   Spanning wide to cross a washed-out gully that is no more than 
ten feet deep, this white-stone bridge seems to be recently 
built--at least in the last fifty years or so, and spans no more 
than twenty feet long and twelve feet wide. The bridge runs 
northeast to southwest, as the ever-busy Merchant's Way continues 
in both directions. The wall of Second Circle rises, tall and 
imposing, to the north.

An Ironsmith's Stall~
   In this small, wooden stall, a large stone wheel that turns on 
a wooden axle sits in the corner. Powered by wooden pedals that 
turn the wheel, this contraption is used to sharpen blades that 
have become dull through use. The stall is enclosed by three 
walls. As a result, the northern end of the stall is open, 
though a shelf provides some respite from the elements.

many stands has been erected to the south, using the great wall 
as one of its own the interior is stocked with sweet and candy.

On Merchant's Way~
   The place where many of Minas Tirith migrate daily to either 
spend or make their pittance, Merchant's Way stretches nearly as 
far as the eye can see in either direction, following the curve 
of the city walls around the perimeter of First Circle. 
Merchants and their prey haggle it out all during the day; though 
more subdued, this continues well into the night, and the cycle 
repeats itself. A handful of guards pepper the crowd, eyes 
attentive on the stands. 
   A wax seller's stall lies directly to the south, while to the

On Merchant's Way~
   Bearing the air of a carnival, merchants hawking their wares 
in an effort to be louder than the next, Merchant's Way stretches 
ever onward in the lower quarter of Minas Tirith's First Circle. 
Numerous people gather together in a horde, every one wanting 
something but none seeming to know what. Pushing, shouting, and 
the occasional crash of mishandled goods are all too common here, 
as are the odors of the less hygienic citizens. A merchant has 
pulled his wagon over near the northern wall, while Merchant's 
Way continues true east and west.

On Merchant's Way~
   A throng of people is ever-present on the cobbled causeway of 
Merchant's Way, ranging from poorly-dressed ruffians to the quite 
rare sight of an opulent aristocrat. Whatever their chore, the 
citizens of Minas Tirith do them with enthusiasm, always moving 
and scarcely pausing to chat. The merchants hawk their wares 
with vigor, and the citizens barter with equal enthusiasm, hoping 
to draw a better deal. The wain of a honeyman lies to the north, 
while to the south, lie the massive protective walls of the City.

from all around Merchant's Way, ranging from tanned leather to

of life are bought and sold. The smell of food mingles with 
pipeweed smoke, blended with the sweet smell of leather, as well 
as fragrant perfumes crushed from flower petals.

The Battered Shield Tavern Commons~
   Stretching the entire length of the tavern is a refurbished 
and well-kept bar. The expansive common room is well-lit with 
evenly spaced bronze sconces and the decor is understated, 
lending to the establishment's casual atmosphere, with trophies 
and relics of long-ago wars and skirmishes proudly displayed on 
its bister-painted walls. A large, white-washed brick hearth has 
been set into the southern wall, to provide much-welcome warmth 
during wintry evenings. The refurbished floorboards and exposed 
wooden beams of the lower portion of the tavern appear to be part 
of an older construction; in contrast, the ceiling and narrow 
staircase leading to the upper floor appear to be recent 
additions. An iron-banded, reinforced door leads back out to the 
plaza, while a door set into the southern wall to one side of the 
hearth leads further into the building.

At a Bend on Merchant's Way~
   A gentle curve following the wall of Minas Tirith, the bend in 
Merchant's Way here is constantly used by the denizens of the 
fair White City to find the goods they need for the day. 
Numerous merchants mill about, hawking their wares and offering 
goods from the stands, stalls, and wagons that pepper the cobbled 
roadside. The stones which comprise the road are worn with age, 
though still, somehow, retain the white luster famous of Minas 
Tirith. 
   Merchant's Way continues west and south. To the north, 
however, a door leads into a tall warehouse.

Merchant's Way Spills Into Merchant's Plaza~
   This is the southwestern edge of Minas Tirith's wide first 
circle, as it opens into a large plaza paved with well-traversed 
stones. The nondescript, fairly worn buildings of Merchant's Way 
open up to the west in a small, triangular plaza known as 
Merchant's Plaza. At the threshold of Merchant's Plaza is a pair 
of buildings; two halls to the north and south, their heavy 
wooden doors barred.

Inside the Fox and Lily Inn~
   Bustling with activity, the commons of this inn sees a steady 
influx of people as they enter and exit from the door leading in 
from the plaza just to the east of here. Darkly stained wood 
paneling line the walls, giving the room a cosy warm feeling. A 
large brick fireplace provides warmth from its position nestled 
against the northern wall. The highly polished bar starts in the 
northwest corner of the room, along the western wall, and curves 
around into the dining room beyond. The southeastern corner of 
the room houses a small stage where musicians are seen playing 
night and day. The walls are decked with a mixture of hunter's 
trophies and quirky nick-knacks. Hanging proudly above the 
fireplace is a golden-brown fox head, wreathed with a garland of 
white lilies. The only natural light comes from the large 
picture window set next to the front door, and the plate glass 
doors that lead into the southern garden. A well worn, darkly 
stained stairway winds upward from here, set into the 
northeastern corner of the room.

Within a Well-Stocked Clothier's Shop~
   Bolts of brightly-hued fabric drape the sturdily-built walls 
of this clothier's shop in a rainbow of shimmering color, 
decorating it behind the racks and shelves. Crude mannequins 
have been erected to model the latest in Gondorian style for the 
common man and woman, and have been placed about the room. 
Although these wares are hardly of poor quality, they pale when 
compared to much of the gaudier garb preferred by nobles.

The Gilded Blade~
   Sprawled out around this large rectangular room, worktables, 
half-completed blades, tools, and pieces of coal litter the 
otherwise well-kept shop. A large forge sits near the front 
door, allowing smoke and heat to pass easily from the room. 
Patrons flock to the shop throughout the day, passing by the 
wares with occasional intrest. Well made blades mount the 
walls, showing off the shop's quality and expertise. The walls,
as well as the floor and ceiling, are made of a solid, white 
rock, edged at the corners with lightly stained pine.
   A front door, crafted from light pine leads out towards the 
business sector of Eastern Rath Sinth.

Eastern Rath Sinth~
   Grayish cobblestones line the road leading north and south, 
right through the main business sector of Eastern Rath Sinth. 
People of various races roam the streets, stand gossiping in 
crowds, and look through the many shops that line the way. 
   Adequate light throughout the night and evening hours is 
provided by tall, glass-enclosed street lamps that line the 
street. 
   Smoke, and the smell of sulfur drifts from the white-walled 
building to the east, along with muffled hammering. To the west, 
a small yard dotted with well-tended shrubs sits before a small, 
white building, a sign staked near the road.

Ralte's Fine Armors~
   Smoke lingers lightly in the air of this well-crafted shop, 
swirling with the passing of people. Grand, white stone blocks 
make up the walls, supporting the ceiling, and separating the 
room from the elements. The rear of the shop is almost 
continuously busy, the sound of hammering, the hiss of hot metal, 
and the smell of sulfur emanating from the large coal forge.
Completed works of armor hang on the walls, lay across counters, 
and sit on racks, waiting to be sold. Only a few pieces of 
scattered coal and twisted metal can be seen littering the floor, 
making this shop well maintained, if not extremely clean.
   A single, wooden, ironbound door attaches to the western wall
on shiny iron hinges, leading out to Eastern Rath Sinth.

Bend in Eastern Rath Sinth~
   This heavily traveled thoroughfare begins to enter the 
commerce area of Rath Sinth. Crowded with peoples of most races, 
most walk along easily, or stop to browse the many shops that 
line the way. The white stone walls of the surrounding 
buildings, some of which are carved intricately, arch gracefully 
skyward, making this road seem narrow in comparison. 
   The grayish cobblestones underfoot are cracked and worn in the 
center, apparently from the heavy amount of foot traffic, wagons, 
and horses that time has pulled through over the ages. Tall, 
glass-enclosed street lamps line the street, providing adequate 
light during the evening hours. Well groomed trees and shrubs 
also line the street, showing the care and wealth of this 
circle's populous. 
   Here the road bends, leading eastward into the commerce 
section and northward, back toward the gates.

Bend in Eastern Rath Sinth~
   Curving west and south, cobblestones ranging from black to 
light gray run underfoot, making up this stretch of Western Rath 
Sinth. During the day, shoppers and merchants flock towards 
their destinations, whether it be shop or home, filling the 
street with chatter and gossip. Neatly tended shrubs and ancient 
trees line the road on both sides, growing in serene beauty 
withing well cared for yards and gardens. Tall, glass lanterns 
stand silently near the roadside, lit each night to ensure an 
everlasting twilight. 
   Bending gracefully, the road turns here leading westward 
toward the residential areas, and southward, ever deeper into the 
shops that line the streets.

Master Landrius House of Herbs~
   This small store is crowded and smells strongly of some 
unidentifiable essence, probably coming from the smoking brass 
censer set behind the glossy oak counter. The floor is made of 
carefully sanded and varnished golden larch, which gives a soft, 
subdued sheen in the day's sun that comes from a series of 
artfully cut windows set near the roof of the stance. A large 
bronze chandelier hangs from the ceiling, it's candles dark at 
this time. 
   Bundles of common herbs are set hanging from lenghts of thin 
rope, displaying an amazing variety of the most commonly 
available flora of the Minas Tirith region. Set against the far 
wall is a very large chest of drawers, sporting tags for each 
herb and preparation contained within. If one took effort, the 
tags might be readable. 
   The only exit from this room is apparently west, through the 
sturdy door of red teakwood.

Each drawer has a small tag affixed with tiny bronze clips, the tag made of parchment and written in a fluid, neat calligraphy. The sheer amount of drawers and tags stand as silent show of the skill of the owner as well as the long rang of the ones that made the gathering.

Rose's Fine Brews~
   Unpainted, wooden planks stretch horizontally along each of 
the four walls of this compact room. Along with the low, 
undecorated ceiling, they give the room a constrained aura that 
is only alleviated by the wide door to the north. Many barrels 
and kegs of variable sizes and shapes are haphazardly arranged 
along the walls, while several smaller casks stand next to the 
counter, allowing the brewer to sell samples of his products. A 
small, spiralling staircase is set into the corner of the room, 
leading upwards towards a small, wooden door.

Kegel's Fancy Cutlery~
   While the room is very small, the walls being only several 
modest strides away from each other, the shop is designed in such 
a fashion that there is very little crowding or discomfort for 
the customers. There are only a handful of items on display, and 
these are available to be admired and handled from a lone sales 
counter, which stands against the western wall. Most of the 
other items are stowed away in bundles of cloth, or wooden 
storage containers on the many shelves behind the counter.

South of a Crossing on Rath Meneldil~
   Large, grey, granite cobblestones pave the fair street of 
Rath Meneldil as it runs north and south past fine houses of the 
citizens of Minas Tirith's fourth circle. Through the street 
presses a constant surge of human traffic, most dressed above the 
average cut for a commoner of the city, guardsmen and minor 
nobles standing out in the crowd just as much as the occasional 
vagrant. To the north Rath Meneldil runs into another street, 
and the gigantic gate to the Third Circle can be seen a short 
distance to the south.

Rath Thoron Progresses West and East~
   Rath Thoron progresses westward, through the private homes and 
occasional shops of Fourth Circle. This road is well-travelled 
and constantly patrolled by the City Guard, providing a feeling 
of safety for the rich merchants and lesser nobility who are 
often seen walking the streets or residing alongside it. Tall 
buildings of white stone loom over the road, their balconies 
decorated with lovely flowers and creeping ivy. The air here is 
crisp, and to the north, the mist-shrouded slope of Mount 
Mindolluin is easily visible.

East and West on Rath Thoron~
   The mist shrouded slope of Mount Mindolluin looms to the 
north, dwarfing the stalwart walls of the fifth circle that also 
lie in that direction. The street of Rath Thoron leads to the 
east and west here past many fine buildings built many years 
past, tall trees periodically sprouting out form the wide road to 
give shelter to those who pass along it during the noon sun. 
Many people clothed in fine colours weave their way through Rath 
Thoron, contrasting against the iron-coated guardsmen that ensure

Rath Thoron~
   Rath Thoron travels east and west through the luxurious upper 
class buildings of this part of the city. Large, well maintained 
and constantly patrolled by the local guard, the road is lined by 
marble statues of majestic eagles, which give Rath Thoron its 
name. The mist shrouded slope of Mount Mindolluin looms to the 
north, and tall white buildings, surrounded by magnificent 
gardens and shaded courtyards, are well visible facing each other 
on the sides of the street.

The Silver Moon Inn~
   The smell of roasted meat and spiced ale fills the small 
common room of this cozy tavern, mixing with the aroma of 
pipe-weed. The floor, walls and ceiling are entirely paneled in 
oakwood, except for the brick fireplace on the western wall, 
where the tavern-keep usually roasts meat on a spit for his 
patrons. A long, hardwood bar stands to the north, and hung on 
the wall behind it is a wide painting of a large moon, its 
benevolent light shining over the rippling waters of the river 
Anduin. 
   Those who frequent the tavern tend to look as though they have 
money, and it is not uncommon to see well-off merchants and 
lesser nobles meeting here. To the east, large painted windows 
look over into Rath Meneldil, which is accessible through a set 
of swinging double doors.

A Small Residence~
   This small, lower class residence is quite bare and spartanly 
furnished. The walls are of rough, interlocked blocks of stone, 
while the floor is paved by creaking planks of hardwood, covered 
by cheap rugs. Small, grated windows line the eastern wall, 
looking into Rath Meneldil, while to the west a door leads into a 
small courtyard. Such residences are not uncommon in this part 
of the city, although many of the fourth's circle inhabitants are 
quite wealthy.

On Rath Celerdain, East of a Creamery~
   Rath Celerdain, fair highway that carries all to and fro in 
their daily journey, stretches northward from the Plaza of the 
Sun, snaking deeper into the homes and smaller shops of First 
Circle Minas Tirith. As far as the eye can see, the road is 
bordered by stone houses, wooden houses, and ancient, warped 
stands bearing goods, like the one to the east, until eventually 
it curves into Minas Tirith's graveyard. To the south lies the 
Plaza of the Sun, the small but veritably bustling marketplace of 
the gates.

Along A Narrow Side Street~
   Rath Celerdain branches into a narrow side-street here through 
the alabaster city of Minas Tirith. The street is bordered by 
tall, wooden and stone buildings, some shops in the mix but most 
of the structures being private houses. Traffic is not as busy 
here as most are merchants or families making their way home, not 
many hagglers or peddler hawking their wares. The white cobbles 
continue here east and west along the street. A bell beside each 
door allows those passing to ring north or ring south to alert 
those within of the presence of someone outside.

A Small Plaza East of Rath Celerdain~
   White cobblestones are set into the ground of this 
moderately-sized plaza. In the center of the area is a small 
fountain. A number of middle-class shoppers bustle through this 
area, as well as the occasional cart. A few bronze street lamps 
surround the perimeter of the plaza, providing light in the 
evening hours. 
   To the east is the Furrier's shop. To the south is the

   A staircase of crumbling stone rises from the street to the
great, dark wall of the city, allowing easy access to a rather
large door. The door bears inch-wide bands of iron at regular,
alternating two-inch intervals, and are riveted with shiny,
circular steel rivets to the oak of the door. Occasionally,
an armor-clad guard ascends or descends the stairs.

On a Jutting Guard Tower~
   Grinning like sawed-off wyrm's teeth, the merlons and crenels 
that compose this guard parapet overlook the storied Pelennor 
Fields, home of many an itinerant farmer, merchant, and trapper. 
When the wind blows, a low-pitched whistling sound occurs, the 
result of it blowing through the crenels. The parapet continues 
to the north, while the city street, Rath Celerdain, continues to 
the west.

A Bottleneck in Rath Celerdain~
Rath Celerdain narrows sharply here, scarcely wide enough to 
accomodate a half-dozen people abreast. The walls alongside the 
road force throngs people into the bottleneck, and the occasional 
crowd forms as folk all attempt to go before one another through 
the gap. The road widens to both the south and to the north, 
bordered in both directions by buildings and stands of all sorts. 
The occasional horserider, cart, or donkey-driven wain barrels 
through, forcing the generally poorly-dressed citizenry aside. A 
short sidestreet leads off to the west, laced with white cobbles.

   Hanging over the city wall, this tower is quite like an 
elevated platform that gives a king's view of the Pelennor 
Fields. When the wind blows, a low-pitched whistling is heard, 
the result of it sweeping through the crenels. Doubtless many an 
orc has been pierced by a Gondorian arrow from this nest. The 
tower continues to the south, and the Lampwright's street is to

   As Rath Celerdain continues in a circuitous fashion around the 
alabaster city of Minas Tirith, one-roomed shops arise aplenty, 
dotted with numerous stands, stalls, and the occasional tent. 
Occasionally, loud shouts of merchants hawking their wares can be 
heard from the northernmost part of the Plaza of the Sun. 
   Two large doors on the eastern side of the street bear the 
richly-carved and painted emblems of the Merchant Houses. To the west, a

East of a Warehouse on Rath Celerdain~
   Rising sharply above is the alabaster wall of the second ring 
of Minas Tirith, denying all those with evil intent. The 
cobblestones of the city street here has been recently replaced. 
To the north and south, the Lampwright's street continues without 
end. Carved into the second city wall is a well-crafted 
depiction of a tree. 
   To the west is a simple set of doors leading into an often

In the Southern Plaza of the Moon~
   Just north of one of the many new-looking buildings along the 
edges of the broadly rounded plaza, this section boasts the same 
recently-replaced white cobblestones as the rest of the plaza 
itself and the road leading from it. Not far to the east, the 
change from plaza to the Lampwright's Street, Rath Celerdain, is 
far from easily apparent, showing the same care as this section 
of the city.

At the Far Southeastern Edge of the Plaza of the Moon~
   Between the last two buildings set in and around the Plaza of 
the Moon, this section of Rath Celerdain bends from the brilliant 
ivory cobblestones of the plaza to those of the road in smooth 
transition. Heavier traffic moves from the west, as many in 
above-average quality of clothing hurry along their way, mingling 
with those of seemingly less stature as they do so. 
   A small sign with a pair of rings hangs from the doorway of 
the northern building while the southern doorway leads to a 
cooper shop. A staircase leads to the second story of the 
northern building, a small sign with a diamond painted to it 
hanging by the steps.

   The old Lampwright's street, Rath Celerdain, bends here, from 
the south and west. Above, guards pace vigilantly upon parapets 
and bastions on the city walls, keeping eternal watch over this 
fair city. The road that runs through this section of the city 
looks to have been recently-replaced with new, gleaming white 
cobblestones. The street continues to the south as well as to 
the west, where the Plaza of the Moon is visible.

   Nearing the part of the plaza where the newly-set white 
cobblestones meet the dull grey of the road that twists through, 
many people begin to expand from their closed-in positions from 
the narrow change here. A single well-kept building rises to the 
east, while the rest of the plaza continues in the other

cream awaiting to be churned into butter line the eastern wall of 
the shop. A cold, running stream that flows from east to west 
through the shop keeps immersed bladders of milk cool. The only 
exit to the shop is through the warped door on the south wall.

Along the Eastern Plaza of the Moon~
   The wide-sweeping and aptly-namd Plaza of the Moon is round in 
nature, much like the beacon of the night, Ithil. The plaza's 
surface has been recently-renovated, bearing cobblestones much 
whiter than Rath Celerdain's surface in the distant south. To 
the east, a new-looking building stands, while directly to the 
west, a small, peaceful sward often sends the scent of healthy 
plants through the air. 
   A large steel gate to the east leads into a grand manor.

   Here in the center of the Plaza of the Moon, a quiet sward is 
enclosed within the gleaming, recently-set white cobblestones. A 
fair bed of white, bell-shaped flowers, surrounded by this green 
sward pays tribute to the moon in all her splendor and history, 
the scent of them often carrying through the air. In all 
directions, the plaza continues, cobblestones seeming only to 
come to a pause before the looming buildings that look to 
surround the plaza in full.

At the Northeastern Edge of the Plaza of the Moon~
   North and east of here, newly-renovated buildings complement 
the newly-replaced cobblestones underfoot, the white of them 
evidence of the recent change. As the plaza continues west and 
south, flanked by more large buildings, it holds a look that 
hints at recent and earnest changes, the cleanliness impossible 
to overlook. This part of the plaza is relatively quiet, as few 
congregate in the rounded corner. Eastwards an imposing manor is 
accessible through a massive, steel gate.

come to a pause in favor of well-tended greenery. 
   To the north, an elegant bath house is visible.

transition from road to plaza is most notable in color of the 
cobblestones; at the northwestern corner, they are a dull, dirty 
grey, while to the east and south, they are a freshly-replaced, 
clean pale grey color. Just to the north of here, a large 
building looms overhead, the cobbles coming to a pause at its 
doorstep.

A Guard Tower~
   This building is a large, simple tower, constructed from white

situated here to provide protection to the shops and streets
of the first circle, as well as provide a lookout over the
city wall. Two large shutters on the south and west wall provide
a view onto the street. A large lamp hangs from the ceiling
yielding illumination and a few simple furnishings allow
the occupants some comfort. A large stone stair set in the
northern wall leads up to a parapet.

On Rath Celerdain Near the Plaza of the Moon~
   Wide enough to accomodate the constant trickle of citizens and 
the occasional goods-laden wain, Rath Celerdain continues true in 
its course to the north from here. The years of punishment of 
the ancient Lampwright's Street have been mitigated by a recent 
renovation of the cobbling, which bears solid, square pieces of 
dark granite, meeting the gleaming white of the Plaza of the 
Moon, visible just to the east of here. 
   A recently renovated shop and Manse stand to the west of the 
street, a steady flow of customers constantly accessing the shop, 
which appears to be a weaponsmith's front. The shop seems to be 
an integral part of the Manse, which sports a tall wall and from 
which a constant plume of smoke seems to emit at all times. To 
the south, a gate leads towards a massive stone building.

Where Rath Celerdain Turns West and South~
   Dislodged like shattered teeth, the cobblestones here are 
cracked and worn, pulverized through the years by the trampling 
of throngs of feet and the iron-shod hooves of horses and 
donkeys. The occasional wain rattles by, a merchant hauling his 
goods to market or home from it. To the west, Rath Celerdain 
seems to sink deeper and deeper into slums, the buildings 
bordering it mostly ancient, though a few well-kept facades also 
reside upon the street. Southwards, however, the street seems to 
brighten a bit more every step one takes. 
   The cobblestones snake both westward and southward here, a 
sharp and convoluted twist beneath the city wall. To the north a 
pleasant home, with a mahogany door, peers sedately out over the 
cobbles.

At a Nut Seller's Stand~
   Great bins of nuts line the north, east, and south walls of 
this stand. Some bins are greatly laden with that which produces 
the fruit of Gondor, while others are mostly empty. The stand 
itself is constructed of warped planks nailed unevenly to thick 
posts in a mostly square fashion. A bar which can be lowered and 
raised serves as the front door for the stand.

Below the Magnificent Gates to the First Ring~
   The massive ivory gates shadow everything here, connecting the 
first and second circles. On the northwestern side, the cobbles 
show a bit more wear, their dull ivory stained and splotched in 
many places. A steady stream of people pours in and out of the 
gate, the coalescence of all types, seen heavily in the first 
ring, fading away here in the second. A more common sight is the 
haggard passer-by. All about a mix of stone and wood one- and 
two-level buildings dominate the sides of the street. A mixture 
of all sounds, from the clicking of wagon wheels on the stones to 
the hustle and bustle of the crowd, fills the air, as does an 
increasingly sour smell; the smell of people. Flickering torches 
are mounted on both sides of the gateway, providing light in even 
the darkest nights. 
   To the southeast, the magnificent gates lead into the first 
circle of the city. The ivory cobbles proceed northwest into the 
second circle.

Bend in Eastern Rath Sinth~
   This heavily traveled thoroughfare runs through the heart of 
the commerce area of Rath Sinth. Crowded with peoples of most 
races, most walk along easily, or stop to browse the many shops 
that line the way. The white stone walls of the surrounding 
buildings, some of which are carved intricately, arch gracefully 
skyward, making this road seem narrow in comparison. 
   The grayish cobblestones underfoot are cracked and worn in the 
center, apparently from the heavy amount of foot traffic, wagons, 
and horses that time has pulled through over the ages. Tall, 
glass-enclosed street lamps line the street, providing adequate 
light during the evening hours. Well groomed trees and shrubs 
also line the street, showing the care and wealth of this 
circle's populous.

Third Circle Rath Sinth, East of the Wizard's Cafe~
   A heavily traveled part of Rath Sinth, this road is constantly 
crowded by merchants and customers transacting their business in 
the small shops along either side of the road. The setting is 
quite pleasant, with numerous trees and shrubs dominating the 
white stone landscape. A heavy wooden door and the large 
glassless windows open up a view into the cafe to the west. On 
either side of the door, the white stone is covered by a lively 
painting of a smiling wizard, pointing customers into the 
entryway with a gnarled wooden staff. 
   On the eastern side of the street, a sign bears the symbol of 
the auctioneer's gavel, newly-painted.

UNUSED The Wizard's Cafe~
   The large windows opening outward into the street to the east 
provide the patrons of the small quiet cafe with a good view of 
the busy citizens of Minas Tirith that constantly traverse the 
Rath Sinth. The windows, as well as the several translucent 
panels of glass set into the roof, create a light and pleasant 
atmosphere. Loyal to the name of the cafe, the walls are covered 
in decorated, though sun-bleached tapestries that portray classic 
images of wizards, dressed in pointy hats, and holding twisted 
gnarled staves. Several tables are arranged around the room, and 
are serviced by elegantly-dressed waiters.

Rath Sinth beside a Portico Gate~
   Many homes of the moderately wealthy of Minas Tirith can be 
seen as Eastern Rath Sinth passes them by. While not carrying 
the splendor of the buildings of the western section of the third 
circle, they are far superior to others found in the lower levels 
of the city. A slight crush of people move through here, the 
occasional wagon pushing through the crowds of moderately dressed 
people to continue the busy commerce of the city. Grey 
cobblestones lead south and west as the street of Eastern Rath 
Sinth turns through the residences that line it. To the east is 
a small portico gate which leads down to the second circle. The 
gate is wide enough to allow two people to pass unhindered but is 
insufficient in width and height to allow wagons or mounted folk 
through. The gate is left open both day and night and a steady 
stream of people pass swiftly through it.

Rath Sinth before the Third Circle Gates~
   A multitude of human traffic pushes through the area, garbed 
in styles of modest housewives to the rich fashions of successful 
merchants. An occasional wagon breaks through the press, moving 
up and down the street of Rath Sinth in both directions. Tall 
lamp posts run at the edge of the slate-grey paving stones of the 
road, and behind them are twin rows of modest residencies to the 
people of the third circle of the city Minas Tirith. The buzz of 
chatter and tread of boots sound out from everywhere as Rath 
Sinth leads south and west.

Rath Sinth Leads North and East~
   This section of the long, well-upkept street of Eastern Rath 
Sinth turns from its normal straight course to curve slowly and 
smoothly to the north and east. Countless grey cobblestones 
stretch out underfoot, worn by the constant weight of the crowds 
of the third circle upon them but none seem to be missing or in a 
state of disrepair. Here Rath Sinth passes by a row of two story 
stone and wooden houses, rather plain in design and constantly 
maintained. To the southwest past the houses the colossal wall 
of the fourth circle of Minas Tirth can be seen. Rath Sinth 
leads on here to the north and east.

Northeastern Rath Sinth South of a Store~
   The ancient street of Rath Sinth stretches out to the east and 
west here, twin rows of cast-iron lamp posts running parallel to 
the street. Another line of structures also follows the road as 
it makes its way through the third circle, numerous moderately- 
designed buildings rising above the heads of the numerous people 
who walk along the grey cobbles of Rath Sinth. A building with a 
sloping roof is set on the north side of the street. Above the 
door, there is an old-looking mobile constructed from old wine 
bottles of varying color. To the south, a small window peeks out 
of a whitewashed building.

Maurel's Fine Vintages~
   Rich enough to be intoxicating on its own account, an intense
smell of wine has penetrated the entire room, stunning any coming
unawares from the door to the south. Narrow wooden poles that
support the low, sloping ceiling have been rounded and carved, so
as to have the appearance of decorative columns. They tend to
look a bit awkward amisdt the bare wooden walls and simple
furniture, suggesting that the shop may be older than the current
business establishment. Rows of barrels filled with some of the
cheaper wines are piled up near the door, while racks bearing all
sorts of imported fine wines stretch out into the darkness in the
north end of the shop.

Bend in Northeastern Rath Sinth~
   The traffic that makes its way along the age old street of 
Rath Sinth is diverted from its straight course here as the road 
bends to the south and west, both commonly-dressed tradesmen and 
finely-garbed gentry-men walking between the row of houses. Two 
lines of iron lamp posts work in conjunction with the sun to 
ensure this stretch of Rath Sinth is kept illuminated at all 
times of day. The faint smell of wine drifts in from the west, 
and a general aroma of sweat, horses and the city of Minas Tirith 
sits in the air here. The tread of boots of cobbles and the buzz 
of conversations assail the ears here as the many citizens of 
the third circle of Minas Tirith go about their daily business.

Rath Sinth Continues North and South~
   Rath Sinth is particularly crowded as it passes several shops 
displaying fine and rare goods. Most of those passing into and 
out of the shops are rather well dressed, appearing to be from 
the merchant and craftsmen classes. Occasionally, a noble, 
accompanied by several guards and servants, can be seen in one of 
the wine or jewelry stores. A smaller stone building stands to 
the west of the road; on its door, there is a large painted 
depiction of a fork.

Northeastern Rath Sinth Heads North and East~
   As Rath Sinth heads through this section of the third circle, 
its normal direct path is released as it begins to twist and turn 
gently north and east, in accordance to the route of the mighty 
wall to the fourth circle of Minas Tirith to the southwest. The 
street is paved in grey cobblestones, a dull slate in colour, and 
while they all look to have been worn by countless years of usage 
no potholes can be seen in the road. A crowd of people moves 
north and south between the stone and wood houses that border the 
street to the east and west, and to the southeast an arm of the 
mighty Mount Mindolluin cuts through the third circle. To the 
west, a dim alleyway could be seen.

of Eastern Rath Sinth as it makes its way through the circle. To 
the north and east a row of well constructed houses of stone and 
wood follows the street as it progresses through the city, the 
second story shutters looking down onto the varied people that 
walk along Rath Sinth. Jutting west to east a short distance to 
the south is a branch of the gigantic Mount Mindolluin that the 
city of Minas Tirith is cut into, carving a way through the seven 
circles of the fair city.

   The usual wide space of Rath Sinth is shortened here as it 
progresses past a number of stores, condensing the passer-bys into 
a moderate crush of people of all heights and weights. East and 
west of the grey-cobbled road are a row of stores, many of them 
displaying their wares for the public to glimpse at and hopefully 
lure them into the stores. The street to the north leads into a 
number of twists and turns in Rath Sinth, while to the south the 
entrance to a tunnel through Mount Mindolluin can be seen. 
   To the east a number of barrels-in-repair lay outside a door, 
while a wooden sign over a western door bears a picture of a 
gleaming diamond on it.

the room has been decorated with very rich furnishings. Several 
tapestries that are dyed in exquisite colors and beaded with 
semi-precious stones are arranged on either side of the small 
door in the western wall of the shop. The engraved furniture, 
for the most part, is stained a rich dark-brown tone. Very few 
items are actually on display, the shopkeeper usually walks over 
to one of the small locked cabinets arranged around the room in 
order to retrieve an item requested by a customer.

the street of Rath Sinth directly to the south. A wide tunnel 
has been cut through the base of the mountain, a wide stone 
entrance allowing access into the well-lit passage of Denmoth 
Tunnel. A plentiful amount of people and goods-wagons move into 
and out of the tunnel at all times of day, moving past the stone 
and wood townhouses that rise up to the east and west of the 
street. 
   Rath Sinth leads off north, while a set of sturdy iron gates 
allows access into Denmoth Tunnel to the south.

An Ivory-Cobbled Road Leading Through Slums~
   Dull and drab, two one-level buildings stand on both sides of 
the road. To the west, a large doorway leads into a wide stone 
building, a floor of hay seen through the open doorway, and the 
distinguished stench of a horse stable confirms the building's 
purpose. To the east, a stout wooden door stands in the middle 
of a wooden building, surrounded by two plain square windows, 
crossed by two thin oaken supports. 
   A stocky sign of wood hangs from an awning to the west, a 
small image of a horse depicted in a bright white paint. A squat 
door opens onto a tiny residence, the planks having a 
newly-cleaned look to them, despite being warped.

   The throng of people continues in both directions atop the 
worn white cobbles, the same cacophony of city sounds surrounding 
those who walk here. Here the transition from the first circle 
to the second is most clear. To the east and west, 
newly-repaired homes now stand relatively strong, their windows 
repaired and freshly cleaned, and with most of their windowframes 
planed smooth. The western home has been thoroughly boarded up, 
and looks quite impregnable. The eastern, however, bears a fresh 
coat of white-wash and looks recently done up, a sign bearing a 
wooden spoon hanging from a chain above the thin door.

customers stand about browsing, and from a thin door set in the 
west wall the sounds of the second circle of Minas Tirith can be 
heard. A pair of shutters allows in light during the day, and 
two lamps hanging from the roof provide it during the night.

A Junction with Rath Daelond~
   Here, the monstrous wall of the third circle halts any 
progress to the north. Hanging from the wall is a large glass 
lantern, several candles, while not lit during the daytime, are 
ready to provide light during the dark times. The recently swept 
ivory stones join Rath Daelond, which heads off to the east and 
west. Both paths, eastern and western, rise ever so slowly as 
they hug the mountainside. Rath Daelond, as it stretches west, 
leads to a freshly illuminated area, lampposts dotting the 
southern edge of the road, shadowed by the magnificent grey stone 
of the mountain. Rath Daelond also shoots east, following the 
mountain as it curves gradually northward. To the north the 
shopfront of a small cooperage can be seen.

Rath Daelond, Shadowed by the Mountain~
   Hemmed in on the north by the towering ivory wall of the third 
circle and on the south by one- and two-story buildings of 
varying materials, this road climbs slowly as it travels to the 
west. Along the southern edge of the road, seemingly new, iron 
lammposts have been installed, helping to keep this area well-lit 
even at night. A well built structure lies directly to the 
south, built of large rectangular stones a startling white in 
color. A mahogany roof tops the building, and a window of the 
same wood has been placed to the left of the sturdy door, thin 
steel bars cascading vertically over the glass.

   This home consists of a single room and four white washed 
walls, the roof made from densely woven thatch. Shutters either 
side of the solid oak door provide light during the daytime, and 
much of this squalid home has been conquered by dust and spider

   Hemmed in on the north by the towering ivory wall of the third 
circle and on the south by one- and two-story buildings of 
varying materials, this road climbs gradually as it follows the 
mountainside east. Where tall poles used to stand on the 
southern side of the street, there are now a number of iron 
lampposts. A dusty one-story building of light cedar, the roof 
tiled with red slates, rises to the south, four round windows 
dotting its visage. A sturdy door leads into the building, 
though it looks as though it's been closed off some time ago.

The Leaking Barrel Tavern~
   The old wooden planks of this establishment creak under the 
weight of the crowd. A thick layer of dirt and dust covers the 
floor, turning the otherwise rich cedar a dull grey-brown in 
color. Rather populated, this large building is open at all 
hours, and is very rarely empty, judging by the number of faces 
seen now. Against the eastern wall rests the long bar of light 
wood, the rest of the tavern filled with uniformly round tables, 
each cluttered with a wide array of refuse. Empty tankards, 
glasses, and half-eaten meals pile high upon the tabletops. The 
four windows implanted in the western wall provide a dim light, 
their panes covered in the same dirt that haunts the floor. 
   A small, almost unnoticeable, door leads south from the back 
of the tavern, while a large one leads west onto the street.

The Western End of Rath Daelond~
   Here the mountain all but blocks the sun, and the shadows 
encroach on everything. The fresh-seeming torches spaced evenly 
around this area give it a strong authority of light, leaving few 
shadows here. To the north, a lit and clutter-free alleyway 
begins behind a blackened portcullis of vertical iron bars, the 
white stone of the third circle's wall extending out into the 
path in order to connect with the white wall of the first circle 
to the south. An ivory archway bridges over the portcullis. 
From beyond, there is the slight, much reduced smell of refuse, 
while southwards, there is a newly white-washed building, the 
paint fresh and, as of yet, unmarred. A door, rounded at the 
top, allows entrance to the forgotten building, sturdy iron 
strips falling down its surface for support. There is a 
miniscule wooden plaque beside the doorway, a small picture of a 
golden key shabbily painted there.

A Quaint, Shabbily-Painted Locksmith's Shop~
   Covered in a cheap, thick white-wash, the walls of this small, 
homey shop peel and crack with age. Underneath, the same pale 
white boards creak and moan with each passing moment. Against 
the northern wall stands a large ash cabinet, cracked windows of 
dirty glass, implanted in the face of the cabinet, allow a look 
upon the many different keys of all different metals. To the 
south, only a few feet from the cabinet due to the small size of 
this shop, stands the locksmith's squat desk and work bench, a 
wide array of tools scattered over the surface of the desk. 
   A small door, reinforced with a few thick strips of iron, 
leads back onto the cobbles of Rath Celerdain to the east.

The Eastern End of a Dark and Dank Alleyway~
   Looming to the west and casting an impenetrable shadow over 
this place, the wall of the third circle stands. The only 
sunlight visible is that light high up that strikes the side of 
the wall or the mountain. Lining the street to the east are many 
miniscule homes of splintered and rotten wood, a broken window 
here and there allowing a look into the one-room houses. The 
remnants of piles of garbage are still visible in places, but for 
the most part, the streets seem relatively clean of refuse. 
Standing to the west and stretching back to the wall of the first 
circle, a burned out warehouse wobbles upon flimsy boards, the 
roof missing and the walls charred an endless black. An iron 
portcullis allows one to exit the dank alleyway south. The 
charred shell of a warehouse rises to the west, and the alley 
stretches on to the north, winding in between tiny dilapidated 
residences.

A Dark and Dank Alleyway~
   Looming to the north and casting an impenetrable shadow over 
this place, the wall of the third circle stands. Here the wall 
begins to turn to the north, now diving more toward the heart of 
the mountain. The only sunlight visible is that light high up 
that strikes the side of the wall or the mountain. Hugging the 
wall that slants now to the northwest is a large warehouse, 
standing two stories tall and dominating this section of Rath 
Daelond. Many round windows, framed with a dark oak, dot its 
visage. Flimsy shacks line the alleyway to the east, and traces 
of garbage mark the outlines of where piles used to be. A 
drooping clothesline connects the roof of one dwelling to the 
wall of the third circle. A pathetically thin door leads to the 
east into a one-room dwelling, and the towering warehouse can be 
accessed to the north.

A Run-Down Residence~
   Built entirely of filthy black boards, this one room dwelling 
is rather pitiful. A thick layer of dirt covers this place. In 
the approximate center of the residence lies a pile of charred 
wood, apparently the remnants of some past fire. The eastern 
wall is barely standing. Flame has licked its sides, turning the 
wall a jet-black color, and many planks have already fallen into 
this home. One miniscule, grime-covered window occupies the 
northern wall, allowing a somber look onto the alleyway outside. 
A pathetically thin door opens onto the alleyway to the west, the 
only apparent exit from this dwelling.

   Very little natural light is allowed in a window on the north

The end of Rath Celerdain is marked by a black, wrought-iron 
gate to the north, simple in design and allowing one to see past 
it. Stretching far to the east, the ancient Lampwright's Street 
wraps around the circular city of Minas Tirith. The gate, 
dwarfed by both the towering wall of Second Circle and the 
massive exterior wall of the city, leads into a quiet, almost 
undeveloped area of Minas Tirith, filled with ancient evergreens 
and the graves of the departed.
    Rath Celerdain leads eastward, while through the gate lies 
Rath Talant.  To the south a sleepy manor looks out over all
those that pass by.

plethora of buildings in a wide variety of states. A noteworthy 
building lies just to the north: opposed to the rotting wood and 
crumbling stone of the rest of the slums, this one is made of 
thick, pristine stone, their whitewashed surfaces kept gleaming. 
The well-known cobblestones of Rath Celerdain continue onward, 
unburdened in their march from east to west, however hidden by 
dirt and frequent puddles of animal offal they may be.

by Minas Tirith's walls. On the north side of the road stands a 
sturdily-constructed building of oaken planks, bearing a layer of 
recent whitewash that distinguishes it from the dull grey 
buildings around it. Directly across from it, is an iron-gate, 
beyond which can be seen an expansive manse, a large wall of 
stone rising behind it.

A Turn in the Dark and Dank Alleyway~
   Looming to the northeast now, past a monstrous warehouse, and 
still casting an impenetrable shadow over this place, the wall of 
the third circle stands. The only sunlight visible is that light 
high up that strikes the side of the wall or the mountain. Small 
torches, spaced evenly on the western side of the alleyway, do 
little to cancel out the darkness of this section of Rath 
Daelond. Flimsy shacks line the southern and western sides of 
the street, their monotony intermittently broken by a few run- 
down shops that look to have been recently boarded up and 
abandoned. 
   Here the relatively clean-looking alleyway turns from the east 
to the north, the once-impenetrable darkness of the area 
lightened by a ring of iron lammposts which follow the wall of 
the third ring.

The Beginning of Rath Talant~
   The harshness of a busy city collides with the gentle quiet of 
a grove which opens up to the west. Evergreens, natural to the 
mountainside upon which this city is built, line both sides of 
the road, which turns to the west. To the south lies a gate of 
wrought iron, leading into the busy Rath Celerdain. The wind 
continually whistles through the pines, creating an eerie sound 
most often only heard in the wild. Along the east and north, the 
city wall of Minas Tirith is not impeded a bit by the evergreens, 
rising higher than most.

Along Rath Talant~
   Between the wall of the Second Circle and the outer wall of 
the City of Minas Tirith sprawls this sweeping, barren, and 
generally quiet section of loosely-maintained pathway. Cracked 
and pulverized cobblestones, ancient as the massive trees around 
them, weave through numbers of headstones and cairns, and the 
occasional crypt. To the west and east, Rath Talant continues in 
an undisturbed reverie much different than the rest of the city. 
A white picket fence runs along the road to the north, separating
the road from the cemetery. The only openings in the fence are
for pathways that lead into the cemetery.

Rath Talant, South of Some Cairns~
   Evergreens, natural to the mountainside upon which this city 
is built, line both sides of the road, although a field filled 
with cairns can be entered through the treeline to the north. To 
the south, beyond the tall-reaching trees, the city wall can be 
seen. Rath Talant continues to the west, as well as to the east.

On Rath Talant~

Rath Talant beside the City Gardens~
   With a gentle wind whispering voicelessly through the pines 
that mark this part of the city, the treetops above sway 
peacefully overhead, as if they were locked in an eternal dance 
with Yavanna. To the north, a narrow path leads to a crypt, 
while to the east and west, Rath Talant stretches almost 
endlessly toward parts unknown. A white picket fence runs along 
the northern side of the road, occasionally opening up for a

Rath Talant, North of a Field~
    Rath Talant is all but silent save for the whistling of the 
wind through the towering evergreens above and the thick carpet
of pine needles crunching underfoot. It's hard to imagine that
this is within the confines of the city, yet the reality of the
imposing wall to the southeast confirms that fact. A field lies

On a Stretch on Rath Talant~
   The street known as Rath Talant curves here, stretching to the 
south and east. Overhead, the evergreens dance to music that 
cannot be heard by mortal ears. Indeed, it is a melody that few 
in Middle Earth can hear, save for those of Elven descent. To 
the west, a high wall of rock ascends many hundreds of feet, the 
natural boundary of Minas Tirith known as Mount Mindolluin.

   A tall oak tree towers many tens of feet here, hiding the 
northern wall and shading the dirt underfoot and all those who 
might choose to rest in its respite. All about the tree stand 
gravestones, plentiful and mostly weather-worn. Vines creep upon 
the city wall to the north, their umber and emerald shades 
providing stark contrast against the faded gray cobblestones. 
   To the east lies a small shack, which is nearly hidden by a 
multitude of pine trees.

Amidst Some Recently Piled Cairns~
   This is a smallish graveyard that has been filled halfway with 
cairns, many of them recently stacked. The peace of souls that 
have departed is evident in the overwhelming quietness and
respect of this locale, despite being located within the city
walls. A ring of evergreens surrounds the graveyard to the
north, east, and west, along with the wall of the city, while

   This is a rather cramped crypt, being about five feet wide, 
and six feet long. On the eastern wall of the crypt is a stone 
dais covered by a top much too heavy for any mortal to move 
alone. A stained glass window on the northern wall allows any 
ambient light in. The window depicts a great warrior in full 
battle array. To the west, a door spills into a small grove of 
pines.

gravestones are either crumbled, toppled, or broken. Long 
forgotten by man but not by Iluvatar, the writing on many of the

city wall. The grasses here are well kept, trimmed neatly to 
allow easy movement about the area. The steady noise of the city 
and even the animals that gather about the park seem to be hushed 
here, leaving an unsettling silence. No birds or animals travel 
near the towering beech tree, sticking more to the evergreens 
that grow around it. A small break in the evergreens leads 
northwards, along a path paved tastefully with white stones 
against the dark earth.

   Rath Talant turns north and west here. As it leads west, the 
cobblestones start to become sparse and overtaken by grasses. 
Off of the road, a thick copse of evergreen trees grow tall. 
Many of the trees are old and several feet thick. A thick bed of 
pine needles hugs the ground beneath the trees, which crunch 
softly under foot. Mount Mindolluin's towering cliffs are easily 
seen a short distance away to the west.

A Quiet Cemetery~
   The cemetery here is mottled with evergreen trees. Crunching 
underfoot is a plush carpet of long-fallen pine needles, which 
fight for dominance of the ground with the aging gravestones in 
the area. It is quite evident that no one visits this section of 
the cemetery as it is in quite a state of disrepair. To the 
south, the evergreens slowly become more sparse as the cemetery 
approaches the road. A white picket fence separates the cemetary 
from the grove of evergreens to the west, while the large city 
wall abruptly ends progress to the north.

At the End of Rath Talant~
   This quiet area wraps around the sheer cliff face of Mount
Mindolluin to the west and south. Pouring gently from a hole in
the cliff about thirty feet up is a fountain of water that
cascades into a pond jutted into the western end of the parkland.
Tall evergreens grow prevalently here and have covered much of the
area with a thick bed of pine needles. Old, forgotten gravestones
sometimes peak up from beneath the needles, but their inscriptions
are unreadable from the passage of time. The road, which has become 
more of a grassy path, halts at the gate to the south.

A Monstrous Warehouse, Hugging the Wall of the Third Circle~
   Made of a dark ash and supported by towering beams of the same 
material, this warehouse is fairly large. Crate upon crate upon 
crate line the walls, pausing only to allow the grimy windows a 
chance to illuminate this place, though they fail miserably. 
rather neat and organized, small trails can be found weaving 
through impressive stacks of crates and barrels of all sizes, 
rising to the ceiling high above. Dust seems to have won the 
battle with the goods stored here; a thick layer covering most of 
this warehouse. 
   In the back of the warehouse, past row upon row of crate and 
barrel, is a thin staircase, leading up to the second floor of 
this place. A thick door leads back onto the alleyway to the 
south.

A Dark and Dank Alleyway, Cut Off by Mount Mindolluin~
   Even during the day, the large wall of the eastern circle 
looms, attempting to cast this area in near perpetual shadow, and 
almost succeeding, save for a ring of newly-implimented iron 
lampposts. The only sunlight visible is that light high up that 
strikes the side of the wall or the mountain. Rath Daelond ends 
here, the great Mount Mindolluin rearing up directly to the 
north. Where the wall meets the mountain, the ground is stained, 
and the smell of old trash lingers, despite the fact that the 
area looks, if anything, to have been recently cleaned. To the 
west, a large two-story building stands, its doorway boarded over 
and its inside silent. 
   Above a tall rectangular door to the west, a random piece of 
rotting wood has been carved into the shape of an ugly green 
goblin, though this door has been boarded up and stands closed. 
The alleyway leading off to the south also carries the smell of 
old trash, but looks to be completely free of it.

eastern wall, this tavern is truly disgusting. A motley 
assortment of tables have been thrown haphazardly into the main 
common here, each possessing a single candle that sits in the 
center of its surface, leaning pitifully to the side as the flame 
flickers brightly. Most of the rugged patrons that bother to 
step inside this place sit alone, their heads hung low and 
focused on their drink. However, a few groups have formed, each 
emitting a different intensity of conversation and laughter, 
mingling with the loud clink of tankards. One corner of the 
tavern has apparently been committed to storage, several barrels 
and crates stacked in a disorganized manner, looking as if they 
could topple at any moment. 
   A tall rectangular door of vertical planks exits onto the 
darkness of the alleyway known as Rath Daelond to the east. A 
rickety, old staircase rises up to a second floor from the north 
western corner of the tavern. Alongside it, a staircase descends 
into a large cellar area.

Rath Daelond, Just North of a Large Cedar Building~
   Boxed in on the north by an impressive stack of golden hay, 
and beyond that, the towering ivory wall of the third circle, and 
on the south by one- and two-story buildings of varying 
materials, this road climbs gradually as it hugs the mountain- 
side, travelling to the east. A dusty one-story building of 
light cedar rises to the north, four round windows dotting its 
first floor visage. A sturdy door, decorated with an 
indescribable pattern, leads into the establishment. Overall, 
the street here has been kept in good, relatively clean, 
condition.

Under an Arch on Rath Daelond~
   Spanning over the ivory-cobbled street of Rath Daelond here is 
an arch made from the same white stone as the towering walls of 
Minas Tirith between two building. Two support pillars bear 
lanterns that provide light for this section of the street, 
fighting off the shadows created by the arch and gate. To the 
north and south of the road are two identical, sturdy-looking 
wooden doors, while Rath Daelond runs with a gentle slope east

North of a Large Residence~
   Well-dressed men and women move at a leisurely pace as they 
pass on through the street of Rath Thoron. An armoured member of 
the Minas Tirith City Watch can be seen here and there, watching 
over to make sure law and order holds in this section of the 
city, and the people here seem grateful for it. To the north and 
south of the grey-cobbled streets of Rath Thoron lie many 
fanciful and elegant buildings of stone. In particular to the 
south, a paved path lined with ornate benches leads through a 
small but solemn grove of ancient sentinel oaks, beyond which a 
large building can be seen. A pleasant home, with a silver bell 
by its door, resides along the northern road.

Shaded Oak Grove~
   Encircled by a high, circular wall, this solemn grove of oaks 
and sentinel trees smells of moist earth and decaying leaves. 
The thick black trunks of these ancient trees are crowded 
together under the dense canopy of twisted branches, through 
which the light of the sun struggles to pass. This is a dark and 
silent wood, a suitable place for meditation. A path lined with 
ornate benches crosses the woods in a north south direction, 
circling around a large pond at the centre of the grove, where a 
few long necked, regal black swans swim lazily, barely rippling 
the surface of the pool. To the south, beyond a low wall and an 
engraved iron gate, stands a tall, lean building.

Rath Thoron, Near Aldimir's Goods~
   A series of statues run along Rath Thoron here, each nestled 
under a delicate street light. All depict eagles in some stage 
of flight and each is the product of master craftsmanship. Under 
the statues lie the gray cobblestones that make up much of the 
street in the Fourth Circle, bearing upon them the hundreds of 
people that pass by everyday. Bordering Rath Thoron as it 
progresses east and west are numerous houses of the finest build, 
and a number of shops offering expensive wares.

Rath Daelond, South of An Ancient Well~
   A crush of people slowly make way to the west and south, 
through the lenght of Rath Daelond, which stretches to the west 
and south. To the north lies a small open space, where an old 
well stands, allowing the citizens of Minas Tirith to obtain 
water from there. During most of the day, matrons and children 
hurry to the well with buckets for the varied needs of the 
populace. Travel along the western road, however, has been 
restricted to a large, new-looking gate that has been built over 
the road.

   The dirty cobbles of Rath Daelond turn here, now running west 
and north between various buildings of all types. However, they 
all retain a certain grunge to them. Masses and masses of people 
crowd and push here, the traffic bottlenecked as everyone tries 
to negotiate the building to the northwest. To the south and 
east, the ivory wall of the first circle rises, dominating this 
section of the street.

Rath Daelond, North of its Turn to the West~
   The masses push this way and that, many carts and haggard 
passers-by carrying baskets obviously destined for the great 
markets of the first circle. The stink of people, mounts, and 
wood mixes oddly together, providing a truly offensive stench to 
this section of Rath Daelond. A few ragged wagon wheels lie 
discarded against the eastern wall, most warped or riddled with 
holes, generally unusable. 
   Rath Daelond stretches on to the north and south, where it 
abruptly turns to the west to avoid the wall of the first circle, 
the masses of people packing uncomfortably together. To the 
east, a flat carving of a mule drawn cart dangles from above the 
wide doorway.

Randall's Carts and Wagons~
   Easily the size of a large warehouse, the wooden timbers that 
make up the walls enclose within them a number of carts in all 
states of condition, quality, disrepair and paint surface. A 
scattered range of customers looks through the wagons offered, and 
lanterns dangling from the wooden beams that cross the roof cast 
down light onto the floor, illuminating the wares. The smell of 
oil, sawdust, as well as the resins and glues used to hold the 
carts together hangs heavy in the air here, two small shutters 
set highup in the western-most wall doing little to combat the 
smell here. 
   Set in the west wall are two wide doors that swing out onto 
the street of Rath Daelond, while a small, narrow door leads 
further east into the store.

mountainside, now running to the east and south. Past the
dilapidated building to the west, the ivory of the third circle
wall looms over this place and curves along with the cobbles of
Rath Daelond, also found to the north. The stink of people and

A Quick Turn in Rath Daelond From the East to the South~
   The cobbles turn very sharply here from east to south, or 
south to east, for the street has been cut off by the homes that 
line all sides of the street. The crowd struggles around the 
corner, and there is little room for movement. All travel is 
tedious and slow, through this section of the second circle. 
Added to the unpleasant jam is the stench of people that wafts 
through the air. 
   The cobbles turn from the south to the east, or vice-versa. 
Disheveled homes jockey for position on the roadside.

Rath Daelond, Southwest of the Jutting Arm of the Mountain~
   The grungy, disheveled homes seen dominating the street to the 
west begin to thin out gradually here. The space once occupied 
by home after home after home is now taken up by tiny shops, 
inns, taverns, hostels, and the like, and depending upon the time 
of day, most are filled with warm candlelight and boisterous 
laughter. One such establishment lies to the north, the rowdy 
customers sending a mixture of sounds out to the street. 
   Rath Daelond runs passed a great mixture of shops as it heads 
to the east a short ways. It also runs to the west, where the

The Raven and Boar Cornerclub~
   Loud and merry, this corner tavern has a warm, boisterous air 
to it. The sounds of tankards clashing against each other or 
against the tabletops permeates this place, coalescing with the 
conversations and laughter to create a strange mix. A wide array 
of people fill this busy place, harfoot and human sharing the 
warmth of the tavern. Two pairs of windows lie in the eastern 
wall, allowing a look onto the crowded street. In front of each 
window sits a wooden table, each marred by years of abuse. 
Across the wood-planked floor to the west lies the bar, sporting 
barrel upon barrel of drink. 
   The crowded ivory street that is Rath Daelond can be found 
behind the broad wooden door to the south. On the opposite side 
of the common is a pair of swinging doors, occasionally allowing 
a peek onto what seems to be the stables. And behind the bar, a 
rather inconspicuous door can be found, most likely leading to 
storage.

The Forgotten Shop of a Toymaker~
   The thick scent of charred wood overwhelms this place, in 
nearly any weather. Fallen, blackened boards are strewn across 
the ground among piles of fallen stone. The ceiling appears to 
have collapsed during a fire, and is laying atop the rubble 
haphazardly. A few portions of the stone walls stand pitifully 
among the ruins, though they sway and wobble as if they could 
fall at any moment. What was once a doorway in the east wall has 
been covered by debris. A makeshift door blocks exit to the

Rath Daelond, Directly South of the Arm of the Mountain~
   Here the road begins to widen as it stretches on to the north. 
To the south, however, Rath Daelond enters the slums and is 
overtaken quickly by the rows of shanty homes. Ahead to the 
north, far in the distance, one can make out Carak Tunnel, carved 
into the verdant arm of Mount Mindolluin. 
   Directly to the south, the cobbles of Rath Daelond turn from 
west to north, and vice-versa. To the north, a few more homes, 
taverns, and small shops line the street as it leads toward the 
tunnel.

Stablehouse of the Raven and Boar Cornerclub~
   This rather cramped stable is covered with a generous helping 
of rotting yellow-green hay. The moldy scent of the hay combines 
with the stink of the beasts here, creating a truly evil stench. 
Their tails flick this way and that in a futile attempt to drive 
off the swarms of flies and other insects. 
   The common room of the Cornerclub lies through the southern 
door. Rath Daelond lies behind a huge swinging gate to the east.

South of Carak Tunnel, Carved Into the Arm of the Mountain~
   To the north a gaping hole has been carved through the 
mountain, a faint speck of light the only indication of an exit. 
On both sides of the tunnel, huge lanterns have been mounted on 
the ivory wall, providing a faint light to this small square and 
the first few feet of Carak Tunnel. Most other light is blocked 
by the green mountain face that rears up to the north. The 
tunnel is rather wide and tall, so as to cut down on the 
claustrophobic feel of the darkness. Still, an empty feeling 
pours from the opening. 
   Back to the south, Rath Daelond weaves through the slums here 
in the second circle. Carak Tunnel leads through the mountain 
and emerges, eventually, onto more slums.

Emor's Carak Tunnel Hostel~
   This hostel is little more then a small warehouse, the walls 
unpainted old wooden timbers. Scattered throughout the area is a 
number of pallets made from old hay and burlap sacks, providing 
rough beds for any who have no where else to go. The room smells 
of lantern oil, and from the roof burns a number of such 
lanterns, providing light for the room. A rickety wooden 
staircase leads up to the second floor of the hostel, and a small 
door, resting unevenly on its hinges, leads out west to the 
street.

The Southern End of Carak Tunnel~
   A faint glimmer of light pours into the blackness of the 
tunnel, which opens to the south. Right at the mouth, on both 
sides of the tunnel, torches have been installed to signal the 
end of the tunnel. The crowds seem to flee toward the light, 
their pace picking up as they near the end. Some are just 
entering, pushing north into the darkness. 
   Rath Daelond lies to the south, running directly south away 
from the tunnel's mouth. The worn cobbles also lead north into

A Turn in Rath Thoron~
   Rath Thoron turns here going east and north, following the 
great white walls of the city. Beautiful gardens filled with 
lush green plants speckled here and there with varying colours, 
begin here and head toward the north in a walled garden in the 
centre of the path. Trees of varying hues of green leaves and a 
range of brown barks line the centre of the garden, shading the 
area close by. Statues of eagles sit nestled within the gardens, 
and occasionally one might have slightly decayed leaves resting 
upon its head from the trees above.

   Rath Thoron travels north and south through this beautiful, 
yet quiet section of the city. A walled garden files down the 
centre of the road, containing a variety of beautiful plants, not 
the least of which are trees shading the area close by. Statues 
of eagles occasionally emerge from the undergrowth with slightly 
decayed leaves resting upon their heads. Well-to-do homes sit 
quietly on the sides of the road, making this a peaceful place.

spirals into a circle, the cobble stones and garden winding into 
the centre of the circular area, ending in a magnificent oak tree 
with branches hanging over to shade the area. White eagle 
statues sit nestled against the walls of the courtyard with 
small potted plants on either side, giving the area a glimpse at 
forest fragrances. A building lies to the west, opening onto the 
beautiful court.

Rath Thoron by the Fountain~
   Rath Thoron travels east and west through the magnificent 
upper class buildings of this part of the city. In the immediate 
area white walled buildings line the road, many having small 
gardens with fragrant flowers blooming. A simple, yet beautiful 
white fountain sits to one side of the street with a small 
statuette of a blooming tree issuing from its bowl. Above the 
buildings here can be seen a spectacular view of Mount 
Mindolluin.

Rath Meneldil Merges with Rath Thoron at a Turn~
   From its straight course the street deviates from here, now 
turning to head west and north, following the gleaming white 
buildings that border the road. From the cobbled road, trees 
periodically emerge to provide an area of serene beauty for all 
who walk along Rath Thoron. Above the buildings can be seen the 
solitary beauty of Mount Mindolluin as it stands protectively 
over the city. The street of Rath Meneldil leads southward to 
the three-story gates separating Third and Fourth circles.

Rath Thoron, At a Water Feature~
   The road travels north and south from here, running between 
the tall white buildings of this tidy area of the city. Trees 
protrude from small garden-beds along the middle of the road, 
dropping a leaf now and then. A small, beautifully ornamented 
water feature begins here, a slight depression in the road set 
with white marble to channel the water in the desired direction. 
The feature continues to the north, following the street.

Past the center of the yard, the grey stones continue unto the 
steps of the grand house beyond that rises a few stories up. 
Surrounding the pathway to either side is lush grass and 
well-tended flowers, beautiful in bloom during the seasonal 
months. Upon the blackened-iron fencing that surrounds the 
courtyard, elegant lanterns have been hung intermittently, lit 
during the evening to perpetually illuminate the yard in style. 
   To the west, a wider path continues across the lawn towards a 
small, wooden stables in the distance.

A Garden of Willows~
   This garden is full of large willow trees that fountain from 
the top and hang low to provide a dome of leaves and a private 
hideaway. Ornate stone benches that have touches of mould 
growing on them sit beneath the shade of the willow trees. Small 
cobbled pathways lead in and around small beds of dull purple 
flowers.

A Garden of Willows~
   This garden is fragrant and large. Purple and blue flowers 
line narrow cobbled pathways that intersperse the 
weeping-willows. Stone benches occasionally appear along the 
pathways and beneath the domes of the beautiful willows, 
providing seating for anyone of a mind. Black iron lamp-posts 
appear here and there giving light when needed, which only adds 
to the beauty of the garden.

Rath Thoron, West of Rynd Permaith~
   Rath Thoron turns north and west from here between avenues of
well-pruned trees. The cobbles of the road are fit together
tightly and seem generally clean. A small fountain protrudes
from the white wall to the north, clear water falling from a
small ledge, while to the south the trees line the street
thickly enough to block view of what may lie beyond.

   The walls of this room are mostly covered in shelves of 
varying sizes and heights, all bulging with books and scrolls. 
The floors are of dark wood and are covered mostly in rugs. A 
few scattered chairs fill the rest of the room where an 
assortment of scrolls have been left haphazardly. A desk toward 
the rear of the room guards a passageway leading deeper into the 
building, the only really visible sign of order. A staircase 
leads to the upper level from the south east corner of the room.

Rath Thoron~
   The road runs north and south from here. The cobbled stones 
of the street are mostly clean and tightly placed together. Some 
potted trees sit beside the windows of some of the more wealthy 
of the fourth circle's residents. The white walls of the tall 
buildings shade the path through a slightly more narrow section 
of the road to the north while to the south gardens flourish and 
the road is wide. A tall white door is set into a building on 
the eastern side of the street, a banner displaying a black 
shield before a silver-grey full moon set above it.

   Rath Thoron narrows here into a thin road between the tall 
white walls of the wealthy residents of the fourth circle. The 
cobbled stones are well-kept and clean, tightly fit together with 
not even a clump of moss or patch of dirt in sight. Large glass 
windows look out of the buildings on either side of the road and 
plants have been added to window-gardens, giving the air a fresh 
scent.

A Turn in Rath Thoron, East of a Large Estate~
   The road turns east and south from here, briefly coming into 
contact with the wall of the fifth circle of the city. The wall 
itself is white and casts a long shadow when he sun is behind it. 
At the base of the wall is a slightly less well-kept portion of 
the road with cobble stones coming away where children have been 
playing. To the west, a Hall of beautiful architecture rises, 
most likely the estate of someone wealthy.

buildings of the beautiful fourth circle of the city. Gardens 
line window-boxes and vines climb houses along the way, giving 
this area a pleasant atmosphere. The cobbles of the road are 
tightly fitted together and are well swept. To the south is the 
entrance to the Fellowship of Scribes, Rynd Thannath.

   This entrance hall is relatively large for its use. A long 
bench which appears to be more of a table intrudes upon the south 
end of the room from the western wall. Upon the bench are all 
manner of scribing implements, including inks and parchments, as 
scribes busily scribble away. The rest of the room is sparse 
though a few shelves display the quality of some of the scribes' 
penmanship.

A Quiet Garden~
   A quiet garden, this place is perfect for a little bit of 
peace and quiet away from the rest of the city. Three great 
ancient oak trees stand here overshadowing the area and dropping 
leaves without regard to people below. A small path of paked 
dirt winds it's way in loops around all three trees, in the 
centre is a small fountain and three stone benches set back 
beneath the branches of the mighty oaks.

Upon the Worn Ivory of Rath Daelond~
   Gruff, brown, dilapidated buildings line all sides of the 
street. Standing beneath the verdant arm of Mount Mindolluin, 
the city stretches out to the north huddled around the cobbles of 
Rath Daelond. To the south lies the northern end of Carak 
Tunnel, allowing passage through the mountain to the rest of the 
second circle and eventually, the magnificent gates of the first 
circle. The massive mountain can be seen rising far up to the 
west and slowly curving to the northwest.

Rath Thoron Becomes Rath Aldamir at Council Crossing~
   Rath Aldamir continues to the north while Rath Thoron lies to 
the south. The buildings on either side of the road are tall and 
are made of white stone. The cobbled stones of the road seem to 
be coming loose in places in this part of the street though they 
do not cause any problem for travellers. Gardens have been 
planted along the sides of the road, giving a taste of the rural 
in the city streets. To the west sits the great Council Hall of 
Minas Tirith, an imposing shape carved into Mindolluin's bulk, 
while to the east is a tribute garden designed by the city's 
waterwrights.

A Peaceful House~
   This peaceful home is simple in design yet is rather spacious. 
The floors are all of hardwood that is fitted tightly together 
and in most places covered in rugs to hold the heat during times 
of cold. The house is lit by candles and lamps when nessesary 
from hooks and holders in the stone walls. Windows look out to 
the north over Rath Aldamir, and if close to the window Mount 
Mindolluin can be seen.

The Waterwright's Tribute Garden, North of a Hall~
   A graceful archway leads into this beautiful quiet garden. 
Grass has been allowed to grow and some large trees hide the 
sight of the tops of the white walls of Minas Tirith from view. 
Dark blue and light purple flowers bloom in small clumps about 
the base of these tall trees. What seems to be a small jutting 
mountain sits off to one side of the garden, gently down the side 
of which runs water in a seemingly natural waterfall. A small 
plaque has been placed to one side of the miniature mountain.
   A door to the south seems to have once permitted entry into
a tall stone structure, though the door remains locked.

The plaque has been made from bronze, and kept to a high shine

   To the Fellowship of the Waterwright's,
We, the Steward, thank you on behalf of the entire city
for keeping the water clean and safe for all to drink, so
that no man, nor woman, nor child may go thirsty within
these seven walls.

The Halls of The Waterwright Fellowship~
   This shopfront is very simple and not very large. The floor 
is made of hardwood that is closely fitted together and clean 
swept, while the walls are of stone. A counter stands to the 
western side of the room and a few large books rest upon it. 
Windows of glass look out to the east onto Rath Aldamir and 
beyond the the Fellowship's own tribute to the namesake of the 
road.

Along Rath Aldamir~
   The street meanders to the south and east. On the east side
of the road the white walls of Minas Tirith's fourth circle
continue to dictate the course of the street. To the north and
west of the road is a garden of tall trees blocking out the
view of what is beyond. The cobbles of this area are often littered
with leaves that have blown from the garden into the road.

   This garden sits to the north side of Rath Aldamir and
consists mostly of tall evergreen trees. The grounds are covered
mostly in a bed of brown needles that have fallen from the trees,
though here and there clumps of grass have managed to emerge. A
small cobbled pathway leads from the road to the south to a
house standing to the north.

side of the cobbled street. To the north can be seen a jutting 
arm of the great Mount Mindolluin, cutting through the walls and 
streets of the city. To the north west can be seen the tall 
trees of a fenced in garden of a wealthy home.

   This tunnel runs beneath a large arm of the great Mount 
Mindolluin. The roof and walls have been carved out of stone and 
are slightly rough. Despite the rough carving the tunnel is very 
high and relatively wide. The road however continues to be 
cobbled and the stones have been placed closely together. 
Lanterns hang from hooks that have been placed in the roof to 
give light to the area at all time.

Before A Crystal-Clear Fountain~
   The white marble slabs that pave the ground here run to and 
flow around the central fountain at its center. No hair's 
breadth of space and be observed between each slab's abutment. 
Few decorations or adornments detract from the center piece of 
this area's majesty. The high mountains rise above in a half 
circle in stark contrast to the elegance of the alabaster 
architecture.

The White Court~
   This arm of the elegant platform that surrounds the gleaming 
dais to the east and its prize is of similar construction to its 
surroundings. The craftsmanship and cunning of the hands which 
hewed its stones and laid them seamlessly together imbue the area 
with an almost other worldly air. Its white stone railings, 
polished smooth and reflecting any light be it torch, star or 
sun, stand in contrast to the surrounding mountains.

Beneath the White Tree of Minas Tirith~
   A white marble dais dominates the center of this courtyard, 
from the center of which grows the great white tree. The cobbled 
stones, each the height of a man, gently meet, their seems 
flawless and without space. No mortar appears to hold them 
together and while ancient it appears that their craftsmanship is 
beyond the touch of time.

   White marble stone shot through with silver and golden traces 
have been hewn into massive slabs approximating the height of a 
man. They have been expertly lain so no seam nor scar can be 
seen. The edge of the area is bordered on three sides by a white 
marble railing that reaches about waist high and stands in 
contrast to the encircling mountain crags which rise up on three 
sides.

The White Court~
   From the vantage of this area can be seen an elegant tree, 
white of leaf and limb, which grows several times the height of a 
man to the north. Faintly the sound of rushing water can be 
heard. On three sides high flying spires of craggy stone, grey 
against the sky in the day, blackening out the stars in the 
night, shelter this area from harsh winds. Under foot white 
marble slabs form the floor, their dimensions and flawless 
craftsmanship a testament to their authors.

Rath Daelond~
   The worn, ivory-cobbled street runs deeper north from here 
into the slums of residential buildings and south to the 
entrances of Carak tunnel. Ramshackle houses and properties rest 
on the eastern side of the street, and numerous people, mostly 
ill-dressed, make their way in both directions as Rath Daelond 
continues north and south. The building that stands on the 
western side of the street appears to be closed.

The Other Side Alehouse Commons~
   With a constant crowd of patrons throughout the day, be it 
dawn or dusk, the Other Side Alehouse common room is rather small 
for a tavern. The roof is low and a haze of pipeweed smoke, the 
smell of middling fare served here and the continual buzz of talk 
from the patrons creates a snug atmosphere. The patrons that 
meander through the alehouse commons are mostly dressed in 
cheaply made and dyed clothing. A sturdy door leads east back 
onto Rath Daelond, a low arch to the south leads to the taproom, 
a steep, winding staircase to the north leads up to the lodgings 
and descends down into the establishment's brewery. A small door 
is tucked away behind a narrow reception desk that extends along 
a portion of the west wall.

Rath Daelond Approaching a Turn~
   Here the ivory street of Rath Daelond begins a slow turn,
the road up ahead to the north turning to the west. Shanties,
slums and other pitiful places of housing run along the
west side of the road, while a store is visible to the east, a
wooden sign hanging from above it, the paint remaining only
in scratches upon it. A crowd of people move through the area,
and the vast noise of the city can be felt here, as well as the
powerful smell of the second circle. Rath Daelond runs north
and south.

Mindolluin and the arm which reaches down through he city to the 
south.

On a Bend in Rath Aldamir~
   The road turns north and east from this area of the road. 
White walled buildings line the road to the west while to the 
south the great arm of Mount Mindolluin cuts through the city 
like a knife. In the road to the north can be seen the 
beginnings of a long avenue of trees and gardens. To the south a 
large, imposing Hall of grey stone rises.

Upon the Paved Street of Rath Aldamir~
   Rath Aldamir runs north and south from here. To either side 
of the street runs a row of trees that have been lined up 
perfectly to follow the road north and south. Cobblestone paving 
fills the street and gathers in a circular opening around each of 
the trees so as not to impede growth. White-walled buildings sit 
to either side of the street, some with window gardens and others 
without.

A Turn in Rath Aldamir~
   Rath Aldamir turns west and south here following the white 
walls of this part of the city. The cobblestones of the road are 
tightly packed together and none are loose. The only break in 
the stone road is where trees sprout from circular areas of soil.
These trees then continue in an avenue at either side of the road 
and continues southwards.

A Pleasant House~
   This building is slightly small, but it is cosy and in a 
well-appointed neighbourhood. The floor is of hardwood that 
creaks and groans when walked upon, but is polished smooth. The 
walls are of smooth stone, though one or two cracks have appeared 
in the top right hand corner above the door. A window looks out 
upon Rath Aldamir and the beautiful trees outside.

Rath Aldamir Turning North~
   Rath Aldamir turns north and east from here, the tightly-
fitted cobblestones continuing their passage of the well-kept
and clean streets of the Fourth Circle. Lamp-posts stand to
either side of the road at regular intervals, lighting the way
in times of darkness. A number of well-dressed citizens progress
about the streets, shying away from anyone bearing signs of
uncleanliness or resembling pauperdom.

the street seeming to rise up slightly on the southwestern side 
of the road. A large tree stands to the southwest in a garden 
and evidently the roots have worked there way into the street. 
Houses sit on the sides of the road placidly watching its path.

white walled buildings of the fourth circle. Gardens 
occasionally are evident and roots of trees sometimes push up 
slightly out of the cobbled road giving it an uneven texture. 
Travellers often pass here, especially military types on their 
way to and from the barracks to the north-west.

road, a rosebush has grown wildly, shielding the view of the 
walls at either side of a gate. To the northwest can be heard 
the sounds of hammering and a distinctly strange smell emanates 
from that direction.

Rath Aldamir Between Two Structures~
   The road here runs east and west. The structure to the north 
seems to have been a grand place at one time but has since been 
closed up. The stones of the road are neatly fitted together 
while to the southwest, above the white halls of the fifth 
circle, can be seen Mount Mindolluin, towering protectively over 
the Tower of Guard.

before the gatehouse which leads to the Fifth Circle of the city. 
To the north can be seen the walls of an outpost of the City 
Guard and to the northwest, the gates leading into the compound. 
Standing several stories high, the gate to the south looks 
forbidding when closed, but opened, a light can shine through and 
a hint of Mount Mindolluin can be seen with a picturesque 
quality.

pieces of hardwood that have been polished to shine. The walls

the stone walls are covered by old, stained tapestries, seemingly 
hung so as to soften the sound of hammering emanating from 
somewhere to the north. Here can be found many different metals 
for sale, in smelted form and in varying shapes and sizes.

metal striking metal. The floors of this building are made from 
the same tightly-fitted cobblestones as the courtyard to the

worn by constant years of unrelenting use, no gaps in the path 
can be seen. To the east rises up a tall stone wall, a pair of 
stout iron gates set in the centre of it. The wall encircles the 
courtyard to the south and north while to the west a vast white 
stone tower extends towards the sky. The sounds of steel upon 
steel rings out from the south, and a wide wooden building to the 
north brings with it the smells and sounds of horses. A narrow, 
stone staircase leads up to the top of the guard house.

Stone Pathway Before a Tall Tower~
   To the west a tall building, constructed from white stone and 
spartan in design, towers over the wide pathway that rings around 
its perimeter. A set of two wide oak doors, nearly twice as tall 
as any man, are set in the base of the structure to the west at 
the end of the black and white paving stones of the path, a heavy 
brass knocker at head height on each of the doors. A row of 
plain, cast iron lamp posts ring around the edge of the path, and 
to the north and south more buildings of a similar fashion can be 
seen. The stone wall that acts as a perimeter for the guard 
compound stands a short distance to the east, a pair of solid 
gates set in it.

   Scuffed dirt covers the trampled ground here on the training 
field of the Minas Tirith Guards. Set around this spacious area 
are numerous dummy targets, practice logs and other objects for 
training use, as well as a number of off-duty guards sparring and 
honing their skills of combat. The sounds of metal practice 
weapons clashing and scraping wooden blades fills the area, as 
well as the occasional grunt and shout. A number of wooden salle 
rings have been set up as well among the field. To the west and 
north a black and white stone path runs about a large building, 
while to the south and east the stone wall perimeter of the guard 
compound stands.

Turn in the Path Around the Buildings~
   Black and white cobblestones run underfoot here, leading to 
the north and west past two large buildings. Each rise up to 
three storys in height, and both have been constructed from white 
stone. Simple in design and construction, the stone looks well 
worn from many years of surviving the elements. Out to the east 
stretches a large training field, past it the perimeter wall of 
the Minas Tirith Guard Compound. Passing through the area are 
members of the guard, either on duty or in their own free time.

Cozy Common Room~
   Arranged upon the two stone and two white-painted wooden walls 
of this common room are ancient shields painted with fading 
designs, moth-savaged banners from long gone campaigns and any 
number of broken swords and shattered spears. A cosy atmosphere 
is granted to this room by the close set nature of the chairs and 
tables placed in it. While no means squashed or cramped, the 
room is easy to settle in to, the light cast from the lamps 
attached to the walls not too harsh for the eyes. Three doors 
lead out from this room, a solid one to the north and two less 
bulky doors to the south and west. 
   A staircase set in the southwestern corner of the cosy common 
room leads up to the next level of the building.

sensible straight in shape. The wooden floorboards have been 
covered with a rich, old, crimson rug with frayed edges, and 
lining the edges of the entry hall as it progress from east to 
west are a number of lamps attached to the stone walls via iron 
brackets. A slanted archway has been cut from the stone in the 
west to lead to a massive mess hall, the sounds of people at rest 
traveling through, while two smaller archways grant access north 
and south to stairwells. To the east a pair of tall oak doors 
lead out of the building.

Expansive Mess Hall~
   Heavy stone walls, an off white in colour and rough in 
texture, have been set wide apart in this expansive hall. The 
ceiling is high up, far taller then any man could ever be, and 
the wooden floorboards of the floor have been worn by years of 
constant use. Filling the massive space of the mess hall are a 
dozen long, sturdy tables, seated at them numerous off-duty 
guards eating the meals prepared in the kitchen which lies 
through a wide door set in the western wall of the hall. Hanging 
from the walls are not only the lamps that light the mess hall 
but dozens of ancient relics from long gone battles, banners of 
victorious leaders and generals and other trophies of victory. 
The smell of good, plain fare hangs in the air, and the sound of 
men and women talking among themselves fills the room at all 
times. A short hallway leads out to a small door to the north, 
and a narrow arch leads south.

ovens and kettles cook on the northern side. A number of 
scullery maids and serving boys assist the cooks as they work 
here preparing food for all of those that reside within the guard 
compound. The smell of plain but filling fare fills the nostrils 
here, and the sound of clanging pots and cutting knives echos 
across the stone room. In the north east corner a trap door 
rests in the wooden floor boards, while a curtain has been draped 
over an archway in the southern wall.

   The only point of entry into this area is a small door set 
into the stones of the eastern wall. The room itself is vast, 
running the entire length of the tower from the east where the 
doorway is flanked by a brace of small windows to west where one 
single huge window gives dominates an otherwise plain white stone 
wall, offering a magnificent view out over the rooftops of the 
first and second circle below and distant views of the higher 
levels above. The southern and northern walls are decorated by 
enormous banners of burgundy cloth, a crown and sword emblem 
emblazoned boldly upon them. In between the banners a series of 
lamps illuminate the room at all hours.

Guard Compound ends to the end, running up to the base of the 
southern stone wall that acts as a perimeter for the area. East 
and west rise up two high buildings, forcing the path to narrow 
slightly between the overhanging bulk. Solid oak doors have been 
set in the buildings, allowing access inside, while the path 
leads to the north. A row of iron lamp posts shine down onto the 
paving stones, providing light both night and day.

Dim Barracks~
   This room is not very large yet there is enough room for easy 
movement about the many bunkbeds that have been arranged on the 
wooden floorboards here. Little other furnishing is present in 
the room, and four lamps, the slides open only slightly to 
provide a dull light to the room, hang from the ceiling. The 
north and east walls of the barracks have been built up from 
stone, while the remaining two from wood and painted white. 
Green curtains have been draped over an archway that leads west.

Black and White Cobbled Pathway Between Buildings~
   The stone pathway that makes its way through the area of the 
Minas Tirith Guard Compound ends to the north at a stone wall, 
the edge of the wall of the third circle of the fair city. Wide 
enough for perhaps three men to walk side by side here, the path 
is cramped slightly by the two tall buildings to the north and 
south of it, widening slightly as the black and white cobbles 
progress to the south. Small doors have been set in the north and 
south buildings, an untarnished lamp post set beside each of the 
doorways. 
  The pathway dead ends at a small wooden shed to the west.

Corner in the Pathway~
   A row of lamp posts casts down light onto the pathway here 
during the darkness of night as it runs between several buildings 
of the Minas Tirith Guard Compound. To the southwest and north 
rise up two tall, wide buildings of the similar plain design, 
both made from worn white stone. To the east a large wooden 
stables lays, the site of much activity from dawn till dusk. The 
paving stones of the path as it turns from south to west are an 
interchanging black and white in colour, solid underfoot.

Spacious Common Room~
   White stone makes up the east and south all of this common
room, the other two constructed from wooden timbers laid
vertically together and painted white in colour. A stout oaken
door has been laid in the southern wall, the frame cut from the
stone, and either side of the door sits a heavy pair of shutters.
The floor and ceiling have been constructed much in the same way
as the wooden walls, and the floor creaks softly underfoot. Set
in the north and west walls are two slimmer doors, opening inward but not
interfering with the furniture of tables and chairs about the
common room.
   A narrow wooden staircase set in the southeast corner of the
room leads up to the next floor of the building.

Wide Stablehouse~
   The wooden interior of the stables is quite airy, two 
double-doors set in the north and west sides of the building 
letting in much fresh air from the outside. To the south and 
east run two small passages, many stalls branching off from them, 
fit for containing horses. In the centre of the stables is an 
enlarged area, bales of hay and riding tack discarded about the 
area. The walls of the stable are painted a strong white in 
colour and show little signs of slaking. The ceiling bears no 
leaks, and the floors are generally well swept. Filling the air 
in the stables is the noise of horses being groomed and at rest, 
all under the watchful eye of the guardhouse stablehands.

Where Rath Daelond turns West and South~
   Rath Daelond narrows here, the great bulk of the slums 
encrouching on the ivory road as it turns gently west and south 
here. A slightly larger then the norm house lies to the east, 
its wooden shutters broken. A multitude of people squeeze 
through this narrow section of the great ivory street, an 
occasional wagon can also be seen. Two lanterns placed at the 
turn provide light at night for Rath Daelond as it widens to the 
west and south.

Abandoned Home~
   This residence looks long abandoned, empty apart from pieces 
of broken furniture scattered liberally around the floor. Two 
wooden shutters sit either side of the door, both smashed in and 
ajar. Dust gathers in the corner of this house, with a few 
cobwebs covering a shattered board or two in the rear wall there. 
A dim beam of light is visible from without, and the walls and 
roof are further apart than the norm for buildings in the slums.

Broken Statue on Rath Daelond~
   Placed in the centre of Rath Daelond here is a tall bronze 
statue of a man. The head of the figure has been removed, and 
various other bits broken and vandalised. A tinker's stall sits 
to the south of the statue, while to the north a residence lays. 
The sounds of metal being beaten mingles with the great buzz of 
the second circle here, created by the countless citizens of 
Minas Tirith who pass by. Rath Daelond heads to a turn to the 
west and east.

Tinker's Stall~
   This stall is cheap and quickly made, and serves the needs of 
the Tinker who operates from here. A small anvil and fire 
occupies the back of the area, trailing off into a small alley. 
Roughly organized, on a shelf and bench is a number of pots and 
pans on display, while another pile of bent and broken metal 
objects rests near the anvil. Out to the north of the stall Rath 
Daelond runs by, and a broken bronze statue can be seen there.

upon which hang numerous pieces of men's garb in various colors. 
The floor is made of wooden planks, worn smooth by the passage of

Before the Third Circle Portico~
   Built up with such craftsmanship and skill that they barely 
seem the work of mortal hands and tools, the colossal wall of the 
third ring of Minas Tirith is cut here by a small portico gate. 
The gate is wide enough to allow two people to pass unhindered 
but is insufficient in width and height to allow wagons or 
mounted folk through. The gate is left open both day and night 
and a steady stream of people pass swiftly through it. Citizens 
of the city, as well as no smaller number of travelers, flood 
through the area, moving from the second circle to the third, 
bringing with them the crunch of boots on the ivory cobblestones 
of Rath Daelond and the drone and buzz of a thousand voices. 
Rath Daelond runs to the north and east through the slums of the 
second circle of Minas Tirith.

Rath Daelond East of a Broken Wain~
   A row of whitewashed and flaking-paint houses lines Rath 
Daelond either side in various states of disrepair, all bearing 
signs of habitation. The road has been cobbled from ivory, no 
doubt once grand but now the work of thousands of feet has dulled 
and dirtied it, here and there a cobblestone missing, a dirt 
pothole present instead. To the west a gap in the line of 
residences holds a large, broken wain, and Rath Daelond continues 
north and south.

   This empty lot has been filled with a large wain, the wheels 
missing and the wooden frame bearing a number of holes and

Daelond coming from the east. The noise of the city fills the

Rath Daelond Through the Slums~
   Rath Daelond narrows here, the shanty-like residences rising 
up and giving this section of street a cramped, confined feeling 
to it. Despite this, many ill-clothed people make their way 
here, the tall walls of the third circle towering above to the 
west. Garbage litters the street near the houses, but the middle 
of the ivory streets of Rath Daelond is clear due to the mass of

slightly to the south. To the east, burnt ruins are all that 
remain. The road here is infected with the heavy smell of burned 
wood, and tinged with the scent of something sweeter burned as 
well.

Ancient Well Off Rath Daelond~
   This area is a small off-shoot of Rath Daelond, and is cobbled 
in the same dull ivory as the great street that runs to the 
south. A number of people make their way here to retrieve water 
from the well, and two lanterns provide good light over the area. 
To the west and east the row of squalid houses runs, and to the 
south Rath Daelond lies.

Squalid Home~
   This home consists of a single room and four white washed
walls, the roof made from densely woven thatch. Shutters either
side of the solid oak door provide light during the daytime, and
much of this squalid home has been conquered by dust and spider
webs. To the east lies the street of Rath Daelond, the hinges of
the door maintaining a fragile grip upon it, and a hazardous
staircase leads up to a second floor.

the form of a burnt shell, the south and west wall still standing

of crates have been lined up against the southern wall. Four 
wooden beams act as roof supports, lanterns hanging off them. 
The faint smell of sawdust resides here, and to the east a pair 
of large doors lead out to Rath Daelond, while a staircase in the 
north east corner leads upstairs.

Rath Daelond Near a Large Building~
   Rath Daelond runs with a slight curve through the tumbledown 
homes and houses, the ivory-cobble still bending slowly and 
gradually west and south. Rising up tall to the west are the 
white walls of the mighty wall of the third ring on Minas Tirith, 
the wooden shanties and shacks at its base contrasting starkly 
with its magnificence. The sloping path continues north to a 
corner and south to where it meets a plaza. 
   To the east a large, thoughtfully constructed building borders 
Rath Daelond, painted a sky blue in colour.

While it may of once displayed any means of wares, the stall now

Summer's Plaza~
   A quaint, rather small plaza, given its location just before
the gates between First Circle and Second Circle, Summer's Plaza 
is basically a widened section of the ivory-cobbled street of
Rath Daelond. Numerous people, mostly dressed rather drab,
mingle here, others passing through on their daily business. A 
number of lanterns placed throughout the plaza illuminates the
area, continuing with the cobblestones to the north, where the 
road falls into slight disrepair, and to the east, where Rath
Daelond eventually leads to the Third Circle's gates.

Summer's Plaza~
   The plaza comes to a corner here, the stagnant homes of Rath 
Daelond gathered to the east. The ivory-paved area seems a 
favoured place for people to loiter, though a number of citizens 
still push their way through on their own tasks and errands. 
Soft conversations fill Summer's Plaza, a mild but insistent 
noise. The plaza continues south and west. 
   To the east, a dark and seemingly abandoned large building 
rises up, while Summer's Plaza ends as Rath Daelond runs off to

Summer's Plaza~
   Summer's Plaza is a rather small square, basically an 
extension of Rath Daelond as it makes its way through the slums 
of the second circle. The imposing walls of the third circle 
tower to the south and west, shanties and ramshackle residences 
gathering at the base of it like dark mushrooms. A gentle 
chatter of voices fills the lantern-lit plaza at all times. The 
plaza continues with its ivory-cobble stones to the east and

   Spanning over the ivory-cobbled street of Rath Daelond here is 
an arch made from the same white stone as the towering walls of 
Minas Tirith between two building. Two support pillars bear 
lanterns that provide light for this section of the street, 
fighting off the shadows created by the arch and gate. To the 
north and south of the road here swings the sign indicating an 
inn, while Rath Daelond runs with a gentle slope east and west.

A Dimly Lit Common Area~
   This rather large common room looks to have been recently 
renovated, as the scent of freshly-cut wood lingers in the air 
and the wood of the solid looking floor looks newly sanded with 
the boards placed close together. Heavy tapestries of brown hues 
line the walls, hiding the wood behind them almost fully from 
view. Dim candlelight serves to create a dark atmosphere, as the 
few candles placed within the room provide scarcely enough light 
to see by.

   The dim lighting of this spacious room only serves to accent
its lavish furnishings, candlelight glinting dully off of the 
bronze fixtures and flickering across the tapestries hung along

those passing through from the large, solid door to the north,
to the dark, narrow hallway leading south, and to the sturdy
staircase leading upwards, as well as everything in between.

Rath Daelond Turns North and East~
   Whitewashed, ramshackle houses border Rath Daelond to the 
south and west as the dull ivory-cobbled road turns here, heading 
north and east. Numerous dinghy hooded brass lanterns illuminate 
the area all times of day, falling indiscriminately onto the 
poorly dressed citizens of Minas Tirith that walk by here. 
Scatterings of garbage and refuse litter the street close to the 
homes, but otherwise Rath Daelond is kept clean by the amount of 
traffic along it. The road leads north and east.

   This building is a single, simple room, constructed from white 
stone that now is filmed with grime and mire. A lamp attached to 
each corner by an iron bar dimly illuminates the room and the 
shelves that run around it save the east side. Littered with 
rusty weapons and splintered shields, the heavy smell of oil and 
polishing compounds rule here. Two large shutters, each bearing 
a secure bolt, provide a view onto the street of Rath Daelond to 
the east as it runs before the gate, the sounds of the city 
flowing into the outpost here.

West of a Charred Warehouse~
   Bordering the east of the street here is a double-level 
derelict warehouse, and along the west begins a row of 
dilapidated shanties and shacks constructed from wood, plaster, 
daub and wattle and anything else found at hand. The rough, 
ivory paving stones of Rath Daelond run north deeper between 
houses and homes to the north up to the third circle gate. 
Humans of all shapes and sizes making their way up and down the

Charred Warehouse~
   Thick black soot and ash cover this warehouse, though most of
it barely remains standing. The western wall is nearly completely
gone, a hole in the wall allowing access to and from the street,
while the eastern half is merely charred. The second story of this
warehouse rises up tall, but the roof is gone, having caved in through
the floor of the second level and onto the ground, bits and pieces
of wood scattered about on the floor.
   A door mostly untouched by the flames leads east out of the
warehouse, while a hole in the wall remains to the west.

Rath Daelond Turns Through the Slums~
   The great winding street of Rath Daelond continues south and 
west here, running through the shanties, shacks, houses and homes 
of this part of Minas Tirith. The ivory cobbled road bears many 
potholes, but even those stones that have survived are well worn 
by the constant tread of feet belonging to the uncountable amount 
of people who pass along it everyday. In the distance, the gate 
to the third circle can be seen some ways south from here. 
   To the east lies a squat stone building, standing out from the 
wooden houses that surround it, and to the north a long abandoned 
residence lies.

   Rath Daelond progresses past many ramshackle, rundown and 
condemned residences, however the state of them does little to 
concern the multitudes of people who live in them. The pot-holed 
ivory paved street runs east to a turn, while to the west lies a 
junction, another street branching off Rath Daelond. Refuse 
lines the edges of the street, but the centre of the road is 
clear due to the hundreds of feet treading upon it every day.

Small, Rundown House~
   This building is made up of a single room, the wooden walls 
bearing a coat of ancient white-wash upon them. The furniture is 
old and tatty, this home having been used fully during its 
lifetime. No spider webs house in the corners of the low roof 
and the floor has been meticulously cleared of dust. A warped

A Well Lit Entryway and Common Room~
   This low-ceilinged room has been newly constructed of 
well-fitted white stone, almost free of ornamentation, yet still 
crafted with meticulous precision. The western door leads 
directly onto the street, and the sounds of city dwellers 
filtering through from it and the windows which flank it on the 
southern corner provide a focal point for those who use this 
room. Further along the same wall, a door opens into a small 
kitchen. The doorways to the east and south bear the only 
decoration in the room, for above the lintel of each is a small, 
carefully carved symbol resting on a twist of leaf-laden vine. 
Above the southern door is carved a sword, point up-raised, 
against the unmistakable shape of a kite-shield. A sturdy wooden 
staircase runs along a section of the western wall, creating an 
alcove beneath. Above the eastern door is carved a six-petalled 
flower and a large fireplace is set in the northern wall near the 
northern doorway.

Junction in Rath Daelond~
   Here the tired street of Rath Daelond meets with the start of 
another, smaller street. Paved in neat, dull, grey cobblestones 
it contrasts sharply with the rough, pot-holed, ivory-cobbles of 
the main road. Running along the edges of the path are the 
rickety buildings and homes of the second circle, but a gap in 
the south leads off to an enlarged area of cleared space. Rath 
Daelond continues east and west, and the smaller street runs off 
to the north.

Space Off Rath Daelond~
   A space has been cut from the great line of slums that house 
many of the second circle of Minas Tirith. Cobbled as ivory 
paving stones, the area here is well traveled, many people moving 
to and fro to draw water from the well. East and south lie the 
shanties of Rath Daelond, while the small space leads off to the 
west. The street and intersection rests north of the area, from 
it coming the noises, smells and tastes of Minas Tirith. 
Somebody has attempted to place some bushes off to the side, yet 
they fail to do more than take up space.

Along the Ivory-Cobbled Road~
   Lined along the side of the street, amid the occasional build 
up of garbage and rubbish, are twin rows of iron lamps, slightly 
rusted, shining down light onto the cobbles of Rath Daelond. To 
the south lays a small open area, a break in the row of shanties 
that continues to the south and north. Behind them to the south 
is the imposingly tall wall of the third circle of Minas Tirith. 
Rath Daelond runs to the east and west, a great number of people 
following its progress through the circle.

Open Space South of Rath Daelond~
   The buzz of chattering and talking fills the ears in this 
small space set aside from the hectic pace led on Rath Daelond to 
the south. A number of stone seats, perhaps originally 
ornamented but now chipped, scratched and broken lay about on the 
loose- fitting ivory cobblestones that extend from the street

South of a New Shop on Rath Daelond~
   The slums and shanty-like residences that grasp at the street 
edge of Rath Daelond as it runs through the second circle seem 
mostly uninhabited in this section of the ivory-cobbled road. 
Still, the iron lamp posts that border the street cast out 
brightly, illuminating the area for the moderate amount of people 
that pass through here, little compared to the crush in other 
sections of Rath Daelond. To the north lies a newly-rebuilt 
shop, with a new roof and windows set in the cleaned-up stone 
walls. A butterfly-painted door leads northward.

Lucky's Adornments~
   A garish but sparse assortment of goods are arranged on racks
around this shopfront. It's built like a normal shop, with a small
front room and a living area behind and above it, like most, but
its shopfront is smaller than most. The building itself is new,
with a new wooden floor and roof built upon the older pale stone
walls. The air smells of incense most of the time, clouds of it
wafting through the shop. Those who leave often find their clothes
and hair tinged with the faint spicy scent.
   A selection of tables is arranged around the shop, and
at most hours, locals can be found relaxing at them and chatting
the day or night away.

Before the Third Circle Gate~
   The worn and dirty ivory stones that pave the winding street 
of Rath Daelond match the colour of the bleak, white-washed 
ramshackle residences it passes by to the north. The plentiful 
men and women that walk on the eon old cobblestones of the road 
look much the same as their surroundings, drab and ill-fit. Rath 
Daelond continues its crooked course parallel to the stone, third 
circle wall and great gate that lies directly to the south. 
Across the street, blackened masonery has fallen across a narrow 
alley, falling from the wall of a half-collapsed building.

Jailhouse Walk Before an Intersection~
   Known by many other names locally as well as Jailhouse Walk, 
this street is rather narrower then Rath Daelond to which it 
connects to the south. It has been paved with rectangular, grey 
stones, and the buildings that the road passes by look much the 
same, conforming to the drab feel of Jailhouse Walk. Few people 
move by, and the second ring of Minas Tirith is rather quiet 
here, the silence increasing as the street continues to the 
north.

Jailhouse Walk~
   The stone street here turns in a hard angle, running now to 
the south and west. There is little immediate noise present 
along the road, though the distant din of the first and second 
circles gently vibrates here. The sparse men and women who move 
by are moderately dressed, or in the garb of the Minas Tirith 
Guard. A number of stone buildings follow the street as it 
bends, far from the typical slums of the second circle.

Along the Clean Street of Jailhouse Walk~
   Variously known as "Sissy's Tavern" and "Dead End" by a 
sizable proportion of second circle residents, Jailhouse Walk 
runs east to west here, the street well cleaned and devoid of 
nearly any refuse or garbage. Light flows onto the street both 
night and day with the aid of the twin rows of iron lamp posts, 
though few people pass by to enjoy it. To the north west a 
large, stone building looms, while Jailhouse Walk meets with a 
corner to the east.

   To the north an imposing stone structure stands, running 
further along to the west parallel to Jailhouse Walk. Two 
storeys tall, a number of windows crossed with stout iron bars 
look down onto the grey-paved street, and to complete the 
construction a tall iron fence, the palings spiked and reaching 
far over a man's head rest solidly between the street and the 
jailhouse. Jailhouse Walk leads east, and further west in front 
of the jail, while to the south lies a small, paved square.

Nearing the End of a Short Street~
   A small and discreet shopfront stands out the eastern side of 
this part of the short street, sitting amongst a number of other 
smaller buildings. The shop looks to have been converted from an 
old house, but by all indications is no longer used. A few lamps 
light the street at all hours as it continues south to north. On 
the western side of the road looms a large building with a sturdy 
looking door.

The Gibbets~
   This small square has been made from the row of dull, grey 
buildings that border Jailhouse Walk. Constructed from the same 
even, rectangular blocks that make up the street, this open area 
here has a sombre mood about it, few people lingering as they 
pass. South, west and east all are barred by the stone walls of 
residences, and to the north past the street is the second circle 
Jailhouse in all its starkness.

Foyer of the First Circle Jailhouse~
 The foyer of the jailhouse is rather small. Little more then 
a hollow, stone cube off-white in colour, the only features 
present are a register desk which occupies most of the northern 
wall and three stout, iron band reinforced doors that lead south 
and west into the wings of the prison and east out to the 
streets of the first circle of Minas Tirith. The occasional 
shout is heard, as is the stamp of boots and jingle of keys, but 
otherwise a heavy silence fills the room.

Basement of the Jail~
   This section of the jailhouse is underground, easily told by 
the warmth and damp of the area as well as the mold that grows in 
between the mired white stones that make up this area. Solid 
oak doors set along the walls lead into the cells, coming from 
them the occasional shout or scream. Boots and keys jingling is 
another sound that hangs on the air. A narrow staircase spirals 
up towards ground, discerned by the currents of fresh air into 
this stale place.

Jail Basement~
   This section of the jailhouse is underground, easily told by 
the warmth and damp of the area as well as the mold that grows in 
between the mired white stones that make up this area. Solid oak 
doors set along the walls lead into the cells, coming from them 
the occasional shout or scream. Boots and keys jingling is 
another sound that hangs on the air. A narrow staircase spirals 
up toward ground, discerned by the currents of fresh air into 
this stale place.

Along Jailhouse Walk~
   Jailhouse Walk runs east and west here, the grey, closely 
fitting paving stones continuing their drab progression. To the 
north lurks a high, stone structure, that of the Second Circle 
Jailhouse, repository for criminals caught by the Minas Tirith 
Guard. A spiked iron fence runs along it, and few people move 
along the street here despite the bright light offered by the row 
of street lamps.

Along the Neat Cobblestones of Jailhouse Walk~
   The neat, rectangular cobbles of Jailhouse Walk run east and 
west through numerous moderately maintained residences, the drab 
grey stones in theme with the area. A small number of people 
make their way along the road, dressed slightly better then the 
norm for residents of Minas Tirith's second circle, passing under 
the lamp posts that bring light at night. To east a stark 
building rises up, the jailhouse that grants the street its name.

Where Jailhouse Walk Bends South and East~
   Cleared of waste and garbage, the grey-stone road of Jailhouse
Walk turns here, running south and east past an ancient statue, once
of a figure holding a sword but now faded due to the wear and tear
provided by the weather of Minas Tirith. A number of the paving
stones of the street are missing around the statue, but this concerns
none of the people that pass by. To the not too distant south
the walls of the third ring of the city can be seen growing up from
the slums along Rath Daelond.
   A stone wall corners off here a large area to the west. Set
atop the wall are cernels that look mostly abandoned.

Jailhouse Walk North of a Junction~
   This section of Jailhouse Walk is filled with the noise and 
bustle of Rath Daelond, the second circle's main street, which 
runs a short distance to the south. Two moderately-sized 
residences, constructed from stone and timber, lie to either side 
of the road here, and a number of men and women clad varying 
between the rags of a second circle citizen and that of a 
somewhat higher class pass between them. Jailhouse Walk leads 
north and south. 
   A great stone wall stretches along the western side of the
street. Cernellations allow the guards a vantage point to watch
the street from above.

Common Room~
   Taking up the first floor of the house, this room serves as 
kitchen, dining room and common room for all occupants of the 
house. Rather roomy, the walls and floor have been laid down 
with mismatching white and grey stones, arranged in no great 
pattern or design. A wooden staircase painted a light blue in 
colour leads up to the second floor, and a secure door spouting a 
large lock lies in the western wall.

through the room, the first floor of this building, brought on by the
apparent lack of occupation. A web-strewn staircase leads up to
the second floor of the house, and a secure door leads east outside
of the residence.

Fire-Scorched Homes along Rath Daelond~
   The normal sprawling slums of the second circle of Minas 
Tirith look worse here then their usual rundown and ramshackle 
state. The burning touch of fire seems to have swept through 
this area, leaving buildings blackened, charred or simply plots 
of empty land weighed down by smoldered planks of wood and soot. 
The normal ivory cobble-stones of Rath Daelond are ingrained with 
black ash here, leading east and west. Despite the damage, many 
ill-dressed people still pass by along the road.

Soot and Ash Covered Lot~
   Perhaps once a home to some of the denizens of Minas Tirith, 
this lot of land is strewn and littered with burnt and blackened 
planks of wood, the sparse section or piece strangely untouched 
by the destruction of the fire that once visited here. Twisted 
lumps of metal and shards of pottery sit among the soot covered 
wreckage, and a dim light falls here day and night provided by 
the lamp posts of Rath Daelond to the south.

Rath Daelond West of Charred Buildings~
   A constant stream of human traffic, poorly attired in clothes 
suited for the wear and tear of everyday life and work, 
progresses east and west here. Their ranks are thin compared to 
other points along the expansive street of Rath Daelond, but 
still strong enough to create a great din of boots tromping and 
voices talking. To the eastern end of the ivory-cobbled street 
here the homes and houses of the second circle of Minas Tirith 
show some signs of fire damage, while to the west a junction lies 
between Rath Daelond and another street.

Junction of Rath Daelond and Jailhouse Walk~
   Another street, constructed of neat, grey paving stones runs 
into Rath Daelond, joining it in cutting through the slums and 
dilapidated residences that plague the second circle of Minas 
Tirith, as well as house many less fortunate residents of the 
great city. Ivory cobblestones have been worn down by the 
constant tread of boot and shoe of the traffic that moves past, 
an odd pot hole or two present among them. Rath Daelond leads 
west and east, continuing its run throughout the second circle, 
while Jailhouse Walk leads off north.

Rath Daelond Approaching Mount Mindolluin~
   Its peaks capped white with snow, the mighty Mount Mindolluin 
rises to the southwest, dwarfing the white walls of Minas Tirith. 
Few people pass through here, a mere trickle compared to the 
crowds that are found elsewhere in the second circle of the east 
and west of the city. Shanties and shacks line the street as it 
continues on. Large holes dominate the surface of Rath Daelond, 
plaguing the efforts of the few travelers here.

Rath Daelond Ends Before a Pink-Painted Building~
   Here the great spanning road that marches its way through the 
entire of the second circle of Minas Tirith ends its ivory-cobble 
stoned path. A large, double-leveled building, painted a garish 
but fading pink in colour, occupies the slightly enlarged area 
where Rath Daelond ends, a large northern and smaller western 
door set in the front of the building. Few people pass by here 
under the shadow of the titanic wall of the third ring of the 
city, but an occasional man or woman can be seen walking east 
down the ancient road.

"The Golden Cat" Foyer~
   The wooden wall of this large foyer has been neatly painted a 
deep mauve in colour, and various pieces of comfortable, yet none 
too expensive furniture set about the floor of the room. The 
smell of cheap incense emanates from pine jars set on tables in 
the four corners of the room, next to them a number of plain 
white candles that light the room. A few people linger here, and 
at odd intervals the door to the north opens. Another door set 
in the south wall leads out of the foyer. To the west, a discreet 
pine door bars the way into a side office.

Staff Entrace for the "Golden Cat"~
   Wide enough for three slim people to move down with some
diffuculty, this hallway is lit by a single lantern hanging
from the wooden ceiling. The occasional creak and groan of
wood can be heard due to movement overhead as well as the sound
of laughing and voices. A small door, the bolt shiny and strong,
lies at the eastern end of the hallway, while it ends to the
west, an old red curtain leading to the smells of food.

   Contained within the spaced cedar walls is the Hosteler's 
Fellowship of Minas Tirith, organizer and provider of much of the 
cities inns, taverns and hostels. Conversations float through 
the area, originating from the numerous people seated at tables 
throughout it. Four rounded windows have been cut out from the 
northern wall, leaded glass set in them to provide a glimpse out 
at Rath Daelond as it runs past. Two solid doors, oak reinforced 
with iron bands, are set in the north and south wall, providing 
access respectfully to the street and deeper into the Fellowship 
Hall.

   Cedar walls, floor and ceiling have been set wide apart, 
giving this room a spacious feel to it. Lamps set in the corners 
provide light here both night and day for the few scatterings of 
women plus the occasional man seen resting in the hall. A 
painted, red house of simple design covers most of the southern 
wall, the mark of the Hosteler's Fellowship, and from the north 
the sounds of people at rest comes. The faint aroma of sawdust 
lingers here, combined with lamp oil. An oak door reinforced 
with bands of metal has been set in the northern wall.

   The walls of this building have been made from light cedar, 
the roof consists of masterfully laid, dusky red tiles over 
wooden roof supports. Around the walls are many displays of 
colourful tiles and intricately carved slates, an example of the 
talents found within the members of the Mason's Fellowship, the 
organization responsible for roofing many of the more upclass 
residences and buildings of Minas Tirith. A light crowd has 
gathered in the hall, casually talking and eating among 
themselves. Two doors lead out of the hall, the first onto the 
street Rath Daelond in the north wall while the second further in 
the Fellowship building.

large building projects sit on small tables, with portraits of 
some of the more famous Master Masons hanging in old frames along

brooding wall and gate to the third circle lying close by to the 
west. North and east lie the tops of the first wall of the city 
of Gondor, with them a distant drop into the first ring of the 
city. People push and crowd through here as they move along on 
their daily business. The building to the east shows signs of 
current remodeling occuring on the outside.

A Wide, Steep Tunnel To The Second Circle~
   Ancient lantern brackets spaced evenly up this steep and low 
tunnel reveal a way up to the Second Circle easily closed off 
when desired. Wide enough for four to walk abreast, a series of 
huge granite blocks at regular intervals are set off into 
alcoves, with cunning mechanisms set into the stone floor and 
ceiling to slide them effortlessly in place in times of need. 
Quiet and rarely used, this tunnel leads upwards to another gate 
above. Too small for horse or cart, messengers clothed in the 
garb of the Lords of Ithilien or the Steward's are constantly 
running up and down.

in the east wall, maybe once facing down to the street but now 
unusuable. A large gap in the west wall looks down onto an 
alleyway below, large enough for a person to squeeze through, and 
a rickety staircase leads down to the first floor.

drive off the Mountain's chill and a series of benches ring the 
walls to offer some comfort for those visiting the Hawkers. A 
raised platform at the northern end of the chamber bears a high, 
narrow wooden podium. 
   Frequently, the podium is occupied as auctioneers and those 
eager to purchase vie with each other for the best prices with 
loud bid calls or a tip of their caps.

quite small; most of the ambient light stems from mounted
sources, a sampling of this Fellowship's wares. A plush carpet
of a deep forest green covers the floor and helps ward away
the chill of the Mountain's ubiquitous presence.
   Set into the western wall, a reinforced door of warmly
polished mahogany leads into the Council Chamber; to the east,
the Hall's main entrance lies, a sturdy oaken door.

this foyer's interior. Gleaming sconces of polished silver hold 
lanterns at regular intervals along the walls, and well-polished 
chairs have been arrayed around its perimeter. 
   Double, glass-paned doors lead out to a small courtyard to the

   The gracefully constructed entry hall to the Woodwrights' 
Fellowship Hall is quite large, with darkly-varnished panels of 
fine oak. The western door has been inlaid with copper swirls, 
catching the sun in bright patterns each time it is opened. 
Several tapestries, mostly depicting woodland scenes, hang from 
the walls. A circular bench is seated in the center of the room, 
where petitioners may wait their turn to meet with the 
Fellowship's Council of Masters, whose chamber stands to the 
west. To the north is another chamber, this one lavishly 
decorated and obviously some sort of lounge.

under garbage, dirt and grime, runs between the looming third 
wall of Minas Tirith to the north and a fence to the south. The 
wooden planks of the fence bend low towards the wall, in some 
places only shoulder height from the garbage. The backs of 
shanties and shacks continues west and north, bordering the 
alleyway, as the fence ends. A great reek of garbage is present 
here, and vermin of all sorts scurry throughout it. The alley

scraps, alcohol, garbage and waste clog the air here, a powerful 
stench. The alleyway is little more than a thin path between 
dilapidated residences on the east and the white stone wall of 
the third circle to the west, trash covering its once white 
cobblestone so that they are hard to spot. Apart from the 
occasional alley scavenger in the form of cat, dog or rat, little 
life can be observed here, but from the south the gentle hum of 
noise fills the alleyway. South and east the garbage trail 
continues.

Back of Rundown Building~
   This space here is slightly widened, paved in what may have once 
been gleaming ivory cobblestones but have been violently 
assaulted with garbage, grime and dirt. To the north the space 
narrows quickly into an alleyway between the backs of buildings 
and the colossal white wall, while south lies a small building 
constructed from a makeshift mixture of tiles, wood, plaster and 
daub-and-wattle. Rats scurry to and fro amid the piles of 
garbage lined up alongside the building to the east and west, the 
only visible life here.

Dirty Alleyway~
   To the south the backs of many a shack, shanty and residence 
lie, a small rear door facing the alleyway as it progresses east 
and south under the great shadow of the third wall of Minas 
Tirith to the north and west. Even at full noon a shadow covers 
the alleyway, and at night a pitch darkness rules here. Garbage 
and refuse from chamber pots litters the ivory-cobble-stone path 
in an indiscriminate manner, the build up so great at the edges 
of the alley the dirty white stones are hard to spot. The 
squeaks and hisses of rats and cats are the only sounds heard in 
this area.

Narrow Alleyway~
   Barely enough room for two people to pass by side by side is 
granted by this narrow alleyway as it continues its progress, 
squeezing between the stalwart white wall of the third circle of 
Minas Tirith and the back walls of many ramshackle huts and 
tumbledown residences of the second circle. These two structures 
in their power and poverty block movement north and south alike, 
forcing the narrow alleyway to continue east and west. Garbage 
litters the cobblestones of the path, large vermin darting their 
way in and out of it.

Backyard of Double-Story Building~
   This small area of paved stones acts as the backyard of a 
number of rotting, wooden buildings that surround it to the 
north, east and south. The largest of these is a double-story 
building to the east. Refuse and junk lays strewn over the 
ivory-cobble stones, a home for many street vermin. From the 
east the sounds of the city float in, people at rest and the 
haggling of street vendors. Overhead to the north-west the 
mighty third wall of Minas Tirith casts its shadow over the area, 
while an alleyway leads west along the gigantic construction. 
   Someone has taken the time to pile a large amount of scrap 
wood, broken bits of wagons, old barrels and wooden beams to 
reach a hole in the second floor of a large building to the east, 
a makeshift ramp running from the yard to it.

Grimy Alley~
   This alley is rather sooty and dusty, with pieces of rotting 
timber slowing progress along it. It runs north and south 
between crumbling and derelict houses to the west and along the 
wall of the second circle to the east. Little to no human 
activity is seen here, but vast numbers of rodents as well as 
feral cats and mongrel dogs pad warily through the alleyways, 
investigating piles of garbage in search of scraps. 
   To the west lies an abandoned toy maker's shop, the narrow 
door opening out onto the alleyway.

Blind Alley~
   A tall, imposing, red brick wall to the north and east stops 
the alley here. A number of broken and smashed crates have 
gathered at the base of the brick wall, far beyond any sort of 
repair or use even by the scavenging population of the second 
circle of Minas Tirith. A large drop to the east represents the 
second wall of the city, that which the alley runs parallel to, 
and also a quick but fatal way to the merchant's circle of the 
fair Gondorian city. The alleyway continues only in one 
direction, to the south, past more battered houses and discarded 
waste.

Sharp Turn in Alley~
   The route the alley takes between the second wall and a row of 
poorly-constructed shanties turns sharply here, running now to 
the north and west, its course dictated by the gargantuan wall to 
the south and east. The sounds of a city at work float in on the 
air from over the tops of the houses to the northwest, doing 
little to avail the area of the pungent smell of vomit, garbage 
and refuse that lurks corpulently in the air. Few people seem to 
be able to brave the stench, but any number of rodents and other 
creatures of the alleys can be easily found darting through the 
trash.

Behind a Large Building~
   To the west a large building towers over the homely residences 
that cluster nearby it, set apart from the rest also by its finer 
make and thick blue coating of painting. The ancient white 
washes of nearby shacks and shanties do little to compare with 
it, but a number of them at least spout back doors to the alley 
while the larger building does not. Out to the east the alley 
continues through scatterings of refuse and debris.

White Washed Store~
   An ancient coat of white wash clings to the walls of this 
single room building, many places the bare timbers showing 
through. A number of rough shelves made from scrap wood and 
nails lines the walls, all sorts of odd objects and pieces of 
junk placed on them. A pathetic excuse for a door, merely planks 
of wood nailed to hinges and set across the doorframe, lies in 
the eastern wall, aided by two high-set shutters in letting in 
the aroma of refuse from the alleyway. Other smells lingering in 
the air here is that of westmansweed, and lamp oil coming from a 
singular lantern set in the roof.

Burke's Well-Worn Wonders~
   There is a distinctly claustrophobic feel to the front room of 
this shop, clogged as it is with all manner of baubles, curios, 
trifles, and bric-a-brac, much of the menagerie worthless or 
nearly so. The maple floors are darkly stained but dull and 
dusty, with some warping evident in the lean of display tables 
and dark, scum-clogged fissures between some of the planks. A 
variety of more attractive goods are displayed on utilitarian 
pine shelves tacked to the back wall, behind the counter. No 
more than one or two customers attempt, at any given time, to 
navigate the labyrinthine assemblage of trinkets.

Clean-Swept Alleyway Near the Remains of a Burnt Out Building~
   To the west of this alleyway loom the ashen remains of a 
large, cedar building. Gutted by fire, the structure of the 
building is blackened and charred, a faded sign bearing an ale 
cask, half devoured by flame, lying before its ruined facade. 
Through dutiful work, the rest of this alleyway has been kept 
clean from the ravages and horrors of waste and garbage that can 
be seen further north along the alley. South and east rest the 
dilapidated houses of the second circle of Minas Tirith, rough 
back doors looking out onto the alley. The smell of rotting 
waste drifts in from the north, and the sounds of life in the 
city washes through this area.

Cramped Alleyway~
   Cats, dogs, mice and infinite amounts of bugs and insects have 
named this section of alley home. the piles of garbage and waste 
discarded from the homes lining the west their source of shelter 
and food. To the east the second wall of Minas Tirith raises 
only partialy, and a view of the outer ring of the city can be 
granted to those tall enough to enjoy it. Through the powerful 
and retching smells the alleyway provides a path can be seen as 
the stretch of space continues north and south.

Alleyway East of a Bent Fence~
   This alleyway, for whatever reason, has been paved with once 
ivory cobblestones, but now years of toil and refuse have reduced 
them to a stained grey colour. To the west a tall pine fence 
runs parallel to the alley, and halfway through it a number of 
the planks have been bent away from the alley. Obscuring 
progress through the alley as it runs north and south are large 
quantities of garbage, a breeding pit for the vermin that plague 
the space between the fence and the tops of the second stone wall 
of the city to the east. Over the rooftops of shacks and 
shanties to the west floats the great din on the city, children 
at play and haggling merchants.

Under the Shadows in an Alley~
   To the west and north large buildings climb out from the 
ground, in grim states of disrepair and their coatings of paint 
peeling and flaking off. The combined effect of the two 
buildings, with more added by the numerous shacks and shanties 
nestled between them and the alleyway, is to cast the area in 
perpetual shadow, far from the natural light of day. This 
section of the alleyway is near still and quiet as it winds its
way south and west between the gargantuan old buildings, only the 
occasional squeak of a rodent or hiss of an experienced alleycat 
breaking the silence. To the east a squat and sturdy shack has
been built in a narrow gap between two large stone buildings.

Alleyway North of a Charred Warehouse ~
   A double-story, charred warehouse rises up to the south, over 
the top of a tall, pine wood fence that stretches around it from 
north to east and south. The alleyway here is little more then a 
tight path, paved with once-white cobblestones, between the tops 
of a stone wall to the north and the fence, as well as the back 
and side walls of shanties, shacks, residences, houses and homes 
of the second circle of Minas Tirith. Garbage has clustered up 
along they alleyway, but no human traffic can be seen passing 
through to take note of the rampant litter. With a sharp twist 
the alley runs along with the houses and wall, moving north and 
east here. Large blocks of masonery have fallen across the alley 
as the warehouse wall collapsed.

Twisting Alley Leading South and West~
   Running and twisting between the white-washed and flaking 
painted houses to the west and south and the top of the white 
stone wall to the north and east, this alleyway is hemmed in 
narrowly between these two forces. Cobbled over with ivory stones 
long marked and grimed with dirt, the hiss of cats and the 
skitter of rats punctuates the silences of the alley, in the 
background the din on Minas Tirith floating in on the air from 
the west. To the south the alley continues to twist and turn, 
while west lies a small space at the back end of a number of 
houses.

Backlot of Houses~
   A space has been granted here between the end of the second 
city wall to the north and the advance of the houses of the 
second circle of Minas Tirith to the west and south. Scatterings 
of garbage and refuse, both human and animal, raises a stink to 
the sky here, doing little to faze the rampant vermin life 
present throughout the litter here. Paving stones run further to 
the east here, dirt and trash wedged tightly between the cobbles. 
   To the south a stone house breaks the norm of the wooden 
shanties, a secure door facing the backlot.

On the Wall of a Large, Charred Warehouse~
   This space occupies the gap between a large warehouse scarred 
by the ravages of fire directly to the north and the cobbles of a 
dank, dirty alleyway directly below. A number of holes have been 
punched roughly into the wooden framework of the warehouse some 
time ago, allowing some a precarious grip for hanging. To the 
south the rooftops of poorly white-washed shanties can be seen, 
and the warehouse wall rises up further, more hand holes present 
to allow progress. 
   Two sizeable holes in the wall, perhaps once where shutters 
lay, allowing movement back into the warehouse, and the workings 
on the street can be easily observed from here.

Ontop of the Roof of a Charred Warehouse~
   Constructed from charred wooden timbers, the roof of this
large warehouse is none too secure, a large hole that occupies
the centre of it sign of the rundown state of this building.
Progress can be made around the edges of the warehouse on the
sections of the roof that remain. To the north rises up Mount
Mindolluin, dwarfing the mighty third wall of the city of Minas
Tirith. To east a large drop lies into a ramshackle shanty,
while the top of a rusty iron ladder rests on the southern wall.
To the west the flat roof of a store room lies, reaching the
wall of the warehouse.

Storeroom Rooftop~
   Underfoot here is a squat, stone building, the flat wooden 
timber roof allowing one to stand on it and move about the small 
space with is. Burn marks and soot cover the roof here, built up 
especially in the spaces where the stone walls rise just slightly 
over the edges of the roof. To the south and west a narrow 
alleyway runs around the building, while the great stone wall of 
the third ring rises up to the north. A ladder set in the walls 
of a charred warehouse to the east provides access onto it's far 
less stable roof, and a blackened trap door is set in the centre 
of the rooftop. Another open roof can be seen a fair distance to 
the west across the alleyway.

Inside the Rathouse~
   The insides of this white stone building are adorned only by 
the bare minimum of decorations and furniture, a single lantern 
hanging from the ceiling fighting back any shadows in this room. 
The smell of garbage lingers here faintly, mingling with the 
noises of the city that float in through the southern door. 
People, often dressed in the barest of rags and scraps, make 
their way across the floor, the Rathouse providing slight coinage 
in exchange for the tails of rats, these people of Minas Tirith 
playing their part in keeping the city slightly cleaner.

Cozy Kitchen~
   The smells and scents of simple, fulfilling meals fills this 
cosy room, the warmth from the oven radiating throughout it. 
Shelves, cupboards and pot rats line the south and west wall, not 
obstructing movement through the kitchen but adding to its 
close-knit feeling. Two curtains lead out of the room to the 
north and east, respectfully coming from them the gentle noise of 
conversation and the din of the city, mingling together to form a 
background of noise in the kitchen here.

Small Lounge Room~
   There is little free space here, the majority of it taken up 
by the furniture present here. Two lamps dangle from the ceiling 
dispelling all shadows in this room, and the smell of various 
cheap incenses mingle with each other. A picture of a green ship 
sailing over the ocean waves has been hung on the western wall, 
covering a small section of the sporadically mauve-painted 
surface. The rest of the room shows a number of these little 
touches of pink, mostly as splashes of paint. Curtains rest in 
the north and south walls, with an archway leading out to a small 
hallway leading off to the east.

perfumes and the faint trace of incense here and there. This

painted unevenly across the walls here, while the ceiling bears 
many splotches and splashes of the paint. Dangling from the roof 
by a piece of chain is a small lantern, lighting up the hallway. 
Oak doors unmarked by the mauve of the hall are set in the north, 
east and south walls, and a stair in the centre of the floor 
leads down to the first floor of the building.

Northern End of Denmoth Tunnel~
   Beginning its lonely trek into the darkness, Rath Sinth's gray 
and black cobbles run underfoot to the south, under the great 
northern entrance of Denmoth tunnel. Below the great stone 
structure of the mountain, the tunnel has been hollowed out, the 
pathway flat, wide enough to let ten heavy-horse to pass through 
side by side. The stone walls curve up and around, meeting with 
the ceiling in one continuous arc. 
   Great, iron gates stand before the northern end of the tunnel, 
only closed by the guard in times of emergency.

   The grey cobble-stones of Rath Sinth continue underfoot as 
they pass under Denmoth Tunnel. The solid stone walls have been 
set far apart to allow wagons, as well as the press of people of 
the third circle of Minas Tirith, moderately easy access through. 
To the south the tunnel ends, open air as well as light flowing 
in from the entrance. Lamps set from the roof cast down light 
onto those who pass through, either south or deeper north into 
the tunnel. 
   Great, iron gates stand before the southern end of the tunnel,

Along Southeast Rath Sinth, South of Denmoth Tunnel~
   Mount Mindolluin cuts through the third circle to the north, 
rising up far taller then the city walls as it moves further 
west. Cut through the mountain is Denmoth tunnel, the stone 
entrance swallowing the grey cobblestones of Rath Sinth as the 
street runs to the north and south. Fine shops and stores line 
the road to the east and west, and many of the men and women who 
walk by pause to peer into their windows to catch a glimpse of 
their wares. The excitement and bustle of Minas Tirith fills 
this part of Rath Sinth with the noise of a thousand voices and 
treading boots. 
   Great, iron gates stand before the entrance to the tunnel, 
only closed by the guard in times of emergency.

Light of the Tunnel~
   Friendly conversation flows easily over tankards of drinks and 
warm meals in the entry room of the Light of the Tunnel, one of 
the finer inns found in the age-old city of Minas Tirith. A 
dozen well-maintained tables seat the numerous patrons of the inn 
that create the friendly atmosphere, hints of westmansweed and 
sawdust riding on the aroma of alcohol and food that prevails in 
this room. Wide-set walls hold a number of tapestries depicted 
with animals of the hunt as well as long-gone battles. Set in 
the western wall is a small door leading out of the Inn, a 
similar door in the eastern wall allowing progress deeper into 
the inn.

The Finer Side~
   Carefully swept clear of dust, the floor of this spacious shop 
gleams with a pale luster, the smooth surface carefully tended 
and maintained. The white masonry of the walls almost glow 
radiantly, the pristine surface clear of blemishes. Racks of 
aged pine masterfully crafted to disappear into the background as 
they proudly display their wares line the floor of the shop. 
Hooded lanterns made of iron and bronze offer ample lighting to 
the store for the darkness of nights. A gentle touch of incense 
lingers in the air, a pleasant scent offering welcome to the 
patrons of the shop.

Southeast Rath Sinth~
   Cutting by fine shops and well-tended yards, Southeast Rath 
Sinth starts its gentle curve along the great alabaster walls of 
Minas Tirith. Gray and black assorted cobblestones pave the 
road, wide enough for the many shoppers and merchants to pass 
though without trouble. Tall, iron lanterns line the cobbles, 
providing the ease of light throughout the night. People swarm 
the road in the day, on their way to destinations unknown, some 
pausing to rummage through the many shops along the way. Mount 
Mindolluin can be seen clearly to the north, rising like the keel 
of a great ship above the street.

according to price. Alabaster stones cover the floor, some dark 
gray, others lighter in hue. Sitting beside the door is a short 
rectangular desk, its surface somewhat stained. In the center of 
the room several tables display books, scrolls, and various types 
of neatly stacked quill pens.

upon long, somber brown tables arranged about the room. A 
special glass case in the northwestern corner of the shop 
contains blades without hilts. Mounted on each wall is a wood 
and brass weapons rack displaying swords and other large bladed 
weapons. The floor is dark slate, chipped and scratched in many 
places. 
   On the eastern wall, a sturdy door of dark oak provides egress

   Noticeably turning north and west here, Southeast Rath Sinth 
travels past a white-washed fence. The road itself consists of 
various shades of gray stones, ranging from black to white. 
Lamps are hung high upon tall, iron holders, lit each night, 
providing light to anyone passing at that time. People flock 
past regularly, sometimes the occasional cart, overloaded with 
merchant goods.

Winding Rath Sinth~
   Like a long serpent, Rath Sinth turns again here, running 
south and east. To the west and north, shops border the road, 
each connected and rising two stories into the sky. Cobblestones 
run underfoot, each gray stone worn, but in good repair. Simple, 
glass lanterns hang from the walls, attached with iron bands. 
The top reaches of Mount Mindolluin can just been seen over the 
rooftops, its outline constantly standing out. 
   A small, white-stone-walled shop stands to the west, its 
simple wooden door leading inward.

Rath Sinth Leads North and South~
   Running straight Rath Sinth progresses north; closer to the 
side of Mount Mindolluin, which overtakes the northern view, and 
south; deeper into the merchant side of the third ring. The 
numerous cobblestones that make up the road press in close to the 
basework of the many buildings that line the way. Activity is 
nearly everywhere in the daytime, the sounds of street vendors 
entwining with the passing of feet, as well as the near constant 
chatter. Far above the rooftops to the east, a great, ivory 
spire is nestled in, between the two, massive, snow-capped peaks. 
To the west a newly painted sign showing a pair of crossed swords 
hangs outside a wide shopfront. A large banner has been hung 
below the sign with elegantly scripted writing upon it.

   Slate gray, black, and white cobblestones pave the road 
leading north and south, lined on either side by tall, 
glass-enclosed street lamps. Everywhere along the street, small, 
lush yards lead to shops of all types, most two stories tall. 
People of all races meander along, pausing to rest in the shade, 
some entering stores. The great wall of Mount Mindolluin rises 
into the air to the north, its top reaches just visible from this 
vantage point.

   Stretching south and west, Rath Sinth passes by small shops to 
the north and east. Daily, many throngs of people move past, 
some stop to loiter in the many storefronts along the way, faces 
pressed to windows. Often a merchant's call adds to the noise of 
the many conversations, a sharp call losing voice in the near 
constant chatter. Tall, glass-enclosed lamp posts light up the 
darkness when needed, lining the road near the many yards and 
gardens. Over the rooftops of the northern buildings, Mount 
Mindolluin can be seen, its great structure rising over the city.

Earthworks Pottery~
   A large stone potter's wheel dominates the middle of this 
large chamber. Beside the wheel sits a small stool of plain 
pine, placed by a foot pedal at the base of the wheel's support. 
A wide box rests beside the stool, its wooden lid coated by the 
ruddy stain of dried clay. Small stains of red and grey mar the 
simple complexion of the weathered floor boards, the scattered 
marks signs of regular use. A large oven sits before the western 
wall, its chimney rising up through the level ceiling a good 
eight feet above. Shelves line all the walls holding a variety 
of clay wares.

Rath Sinth by the Fourth Circle Gate~
   Here, the cobbled road curves gently, twisting its way past 
yarded shops, heading east and west. With Mount Mindolluin's top 
reaches easily visible to the north, and the sheer enormity of 
the peaks to the west, the whole area is filled with the sense of 
insignificance. Many guards patrol this street, passing along as 
easily as the many commoners and merchants, keeping watch 
throughout day and night. Tall, glass-enclosed street lamps line 
sides of the cobbled road, evenly spaced to provide light. The 
massive gate of the Fourth Circle looms to the north, rather 
sparsely travelled.

Rath Sinth Passing By Stores~
   Slowly, the yards resting before the many shops that line the 
way become larger, neatly-tended lawns set with shrubs and small 
trees. Multi-shaded cobblestones make up the road, leading west 
and east, flanked by shops of different types. Gondorian 
guardsmen add to the throngs of people flocking by, interrupted 
every-so-often by a passing cart or horse. Off to the north, a 
small yard leads past a small sign, its face depicting a boot. 
Southwards, a simple dirt path eases its way up to a wooden door, 
the smell of fresh bread and pastries wafting from that 
direction.

Moon Plaza Cobblers~
   A long counter stained to show off the subtle grain stands 
before the eastern side of the smallish chamber. The counter is 
broken near the southern wall, where a single plank lies across 
it, barring passage behind it. Sticking out of the white masonry 
of the eastern wall is a variety of nails and hooks, holding 
different tools and pieces of rough leather. Upon the countertop 
rest a few shoes, oddly all of them for the right foot only. The 
plain masonry of the southern and northern walls is adorned by 
simple shelves, holding small boxes of thin, pale pine.

Lissy's Baked Goods~
   Wooden planks of old pine make of the flooring, their 
weathered form darkened by time and well worn to a smooth finish. 
An occasional lightening of the wood with a white powder leaves 
the floor a mottled affair, much like the rest of the bakery. A 
long wooden counter runs along the western wall, broken in the 
middle for a wide iron oven, its black finish left either by 
constant use or done purposefully. The counter to the right of 
the stove top is dusted by a white powder with a rolling pin 
resting in its midst. Another counter runs parallel to the 
working area, holding baskets displaying a variety of baked 
goods. Shelves line the northern and southern walls, holding 
breads and other staples.

its tip peeking out above the massive walls to the fourth ring. 
Slate gray, black, and white cobblestones pave the road leading 
east and west, lined on either side by tall, glass-enclosed 
street lamps. Everywhere along the street, small, lush yards 
lead to shops of all types, most two storeys tall. People of all 
types meander along, pausing to rest in the shade, some entering 
stores.

An East and North Turn on Southwest Rath Sinth~
   The venerable street of Rath Sinth continues its winding 
pattern through the third circle of the city of Minas Tirith, 
running parallel to the gigantic wall that leads to the fourth 
circle. Two storey buildings composed mainly of lower 
storefronts and upper residences rise up above the grey 
cobblestones of the street. Human traffic bustles through the 
street during all times of day, following Rath Sinth east and 
north as it runs between two paths of iron lamp posts.

A Slight Curve on Rath Sinth~
   People mill about on the street here, dressed from tattered 
rags to fine silks and furs, moving between them the occasional 
armoured member of the Minas Tirith Watch. The worn grey 
cobblestones of Rath Sinth stretch out to the north and south 
past numerous stores and residences of the citizens of the third 
circle of this fair city, constructed from wood and stone. The 
buzz of city life echoes throughout the street here.

The Iron Hoof~
   Straw and dirt cover the weathered flooring of this long 
chamber. A wide stall, constructed of old pine boards nailed to 
square posts dominates the southern end of the chamber while a 
black anvil waits patiently by its entrance. A large bucket 
rests at the end of the anvil. A series of wooden shelves line 
the northern wall, their slightly warped surfaces holding the raw 
materials of iron and tools. The white stone walls are covered 
with nails holding horseshoes and other iron implements. The 
stench of manure lingers in the air mixing with the sweet scent 
of straw and sweat.

A Bend North and West on Rath Sinth~
   Noticeably shifting here, Southwestern Rath Sinth turns north 
and west. South and east, a line of small shops create the 
corner, forcing the road to turn. Cobbles pave the street, dark 
to light shades of gray, riding along under the feet of passing 
people. High over the rooftops, the ivory tower of Minas Tirith 
stands, surpassed in its height only by the two peaks behind it.

Southwest Rath Sinth North of a Large Warehouse~
   Passing east and west, Rath Sinth continues on its gentle curve 
through this building-walled canyon. Made up of different shaded 
cobblestones, the road runs close to the buildings it passes, 
lined by tall streetlamps set evenly apart from each other. Most 
of the shops and warehouses are made of a clean, white stone, 
framed in pieces of light pine and other woods. 
   Over the rooftops to the northwest, the very tip of the white 
tower can be glimpsed, rising high above the city of Minas 
Tirith. Westward, the southern slope of a gargantuan 
mountainside presses upward, creating the lesser of two peaks 
backing the great white city. A small dirt path leads to the 
large sliding doors of the building to the south.

A Freshly Appointed Cloak Shop~
   This large shopfront seems to have once been a warehouse, 
judging by its immense, pine-beamed ceiling that rises high 
overhead. A fresh scent of pine drifts by. From the rafters to 
the support beams of the walls, wood seems to have been used 
often in the creation of this large, squarish building. Hung 
deep into the back of the building, a few boarded rooms hang from 
a block of planks, a simple stairway granting access there. 
Clearly converted, the entire building is filled with wooden 
mannequins draped in cloaks and robes.

   High above the walls of the city, two massive peaks taper down 
to meet, just behind the tall alabaster tower. The great, white 
rings of the city continue down from there, coming to rest just 
behind the many shops lining the road. Cobbles pave the road, 
following the gentle curve of white stone buildings, eventually 
curving out of the line of sight. A couple feet of lawn 
separates road from shop, tall lamposts placed every so often in 
the dirt. A small sign made of blue-stained glass hangs above a 
glass-inlaid door, a lantern hidden behind it.

The Glass Oven~
   Seemingly quiet compared to the busy street outside, the shop 
smells vaguely of burning coal. Smooth, white stone frames this 
quaint room, whitewashed over many times and dulled over the 
years. Large ornately carved dark pine trusses support the 
foundations for the second story. The wooden floor boards appear 
older than the rest of the room possibly because of the dancing 
shadows, which are cast down onto it, from the four lanterns that 
hang lazily on the walls.

Southwestern Rath Sinth~
   From this point along Rath Sinth, the very edge of the ivory 
tower can be just seen. It peeks out from behind the smaller of 
the two giant peaks, its stone walls starting just to the west of 
here. Gray and white stones make up the road, following the 
gentle curve east and west. The buildings lining the street are 
dwarfed by the huge gate that rises up directly to the north, 
providing access into the fourth circle of the fair city of Minas 
Tirith. 
   To the south side of the road, a small wooden sign has been 
staked in the dirt, fashioned in the form of a leather pouch, 
along with a glass lantern hung next to the door.

White City Furriers~
   The subdued scent of fresh leather and oil wafts through the 
air of this spacious store. Dark splotches defile the purity of 
the light pine of the weathered wooden floor that spreads out 
underfoot. Sconces of iron jut out of the white walls, the 
masonry thick and securing. A simple hooded lantern hangs from 
each sconce, the shuttered casing regulating the light passing 
into the shop. A large counter stands before the southern wall 
while a couple of racks holding an assortment of goods stand 
perpendicular to it. The sturdy wood of the racks is pine, 
varnished to a dull luster with pegs to hold goods out, 
displaying them to their fullest.

Southwest Rath Sinth~
   Curving, Rath Sinth progresses east; closer to the side of 
Mount Mindolluin, and west; deeper into the merchant side of the 
third ring. The numerous cobblestones that make up the road 
press in close to the basework of the many buildings that line 
the way. Activity is nearly everywhere in the daytime, the 
sounds of street vendors entwining with the passing of feet, as 
well as the near constant chatter. Far above the rooftops, a 
great, ivory spire is nestled in, between the two, massive, 
snow-capped peaks.

Southwest Rath Sinth on Grey Flagstones~
   Fine old residences built in days long gone past line the 
mighty street of Rath Sinth as it winds its way on a parallel 
course to the fourth wall of Minas Tirith east and west. Grey 
flagstones rest heavy underfoot, bearing upon them the weight of 
untold numbers of people, both commoner and noble alike as they 
pass through the streets of the third circle of the fair city. 
The noise and bustle of the busy city echo off the stone and 
wooden buildings that run alongside Rath Sinth to the north and 
south, and a row of lanterns ensures that lighting is provided 
both day and night in this section of Minas Tirith.

northern windows, on either side of the oaken door, black, 
fertile dirt held inside long, wooden flower boxes grows many 
different herbs and flowers, the contrast of blooms standing out 
against the green leaves. The wooden floor is highly polished, 
running its planks straight from the front entry, passing below a 
cedar counter that stands to the rear of the shop, a light scent 
of the raw wood permeating the air along with the flora inside.

Shops North and South to Rath Sinth~
   Following the gentle curve of the great, white stone walls, 
Rath Sinth heads more or less, east and west. Cracked and worn 
cobbles run underfoot, ranging from black to light-gray, each one 
set evenly into the ground. Buildings follow the road on both 
sides, white stone and light wood creating mostly two-storied 
shops. Every so often, the stones of the street pass under tall, 
glass-enclosed streetlamps, each lit at night to provide ease of 
travel. 
   Westward, a gargantuan mountain wall rises far overhead, its 
very top too high to be seen from here. South and north, 
signposts stand close to the road, each one pointing to the doors 
of their establishment.

   Sacks of ground materials, ranging in size, are everywhere in 
this shop, leaning against the walls, and set on shelves. A fine 
dust hangs nearly always in here, settling on every object below 
it. Every so often, a patron will burst through the western 
door, picking up the dust in a whirl of powder. Seemingly busy 
throughout the day, this shop caters to most everybody in the 
White City. Taking raw materials, and grinding them down to 
flour, masonry mix, and anything else asked of them, they do good 
business.

eyes can see, short lawns lead to multi-leveled buildings, noise 
and people frequent the establishments most hours of the day, 
coming and going with the sun. Tall, glass-enclosed streetlamps 
poke out sporadicaly, most light sources being hung lanterns, 
each near a building. 
   South, a bronze plaque is hung from a few iron chains, 
pointing out the simple wooden door in the southern building's 
face.

around the city that are crafted largely from wood clutter the 
shop, each piece marked in some way or another with a price.
   A polished, wooden staircase leads upstairs, a stained, cedar

the workrooms of the shop, its wooden form fitting perfectly into 
its frame. To the north, centered against the wall, a thick 
oaken door provides access to Southwestern Rath Sinth.

and light wood of each standing out clearly against the black and 
grey cobbled road. To the east, the road bends away from the 
wall, bordered by streetlamps. In every other direction, small 
pieces of an alabaster wall can be just glimpsed, peeking out 
from behind buildings and plants.

street leading south into the plaza, while another staircase 
leads up to a similar door mirrored across the room to the north. 
The shopkeeper has taken advantage of the high ceiling and has 
decorated the entire white-plaster wall with various pieces of 
new, polished steel armor. A large worktable stands along the 
northern part of the wall, where the shopkeeper keeps various 
tools capable of being used for minor repairs on the armor.

   Coming to an abrupt halt, Rath Sinth ends here, a cobbled 
circle ringed with trees and other plantlife ringing the circle. 
Westward, a great mountain wall rises into the clouds, preventing 
any further movement in that direction. A few birds and other 
small animals fill the area with noise and activity most of the 
time, while the activity of merchants and shoppers is kept to a 
minimum, most content staying to the east. A single lamp stands 
in the middle of the circle, ringed with a small flower garden.

   It is a delicately-appointed with the most luxurious of
furnishings, with a thick woolen rug hooked in a floral
design on the floor, and velvet hangings on the walls, worth
probably an entire house by themselves. The furniture is darkly
stained hardwood, ornate and engraved and very heavy. Tall,
barred stained-glass windows along one wall let in light, more
than enough when combined with the crystal chandelier hanging
from the ceiling by a chain.

   The wooden flooring of this modest shop is carefully kept

use. A small counter rests before the northern wall, the pine 
surface holding small baskets containing pins, needles, and 
bobbins. Along the eastern wall is a long shelf, compartmented 
with thin wooden dividers, holding a myriad of threads in a 
kaleidoscope of colour. A stout chair, worn and appearing very 
comfortable sits invitingly at the western end of the counter, a 
hoop of pine is hooked against the edge of the counter. A small 
railing before the southern wall marks off the simple stairwell 
descending below.

Squeeze Between Buildings~
   This tiny alleyway is little more then a gap between the 
buildings that range either side of it, wide enough to allow 
movement through in a single file. A scattering of garbage lines 
either side of the alleyway, but most of it simply coats the dirt 
road, forcing movement to a slow pace. The walls to the side of 
the gap look to have been damaged by fire sometime in their past, 
A few vermin scurry about, and the path leads north and widens to 
the south. Masonery debris has fallen, blackened by searing 
heat, to further block the pathway, making it near impassable

Dark, Narrow Alley~
   This road is extremely cramped, barely enough room for more 
then two people at a time to pass down it through the large, 
shadowing buildings to either side. Light is scarce here, and no 
lantern or torch burns and sunlight failing to reach past the 
overhanging buildings. Refuse lines the sides of the road and 
all sorts of rodents can be seen to make their way through it. 
The road leads in no specific direction, twisting to the west and 
south in a gap between buildings.

Filthy Alleyway Entrance~
   Grey-stone houses meet the backs of wooden white-washed walls 
to the south of this alleyway, both covered in mirk and mire that 
is also present is the waste scattered on the narrow dirt path. 
With a width fit for two people abreast, the alley weaves broadly 
north and east through the gaps of the stone and wood houses that 
line in. The height of the buildings ensure that little to no 
natural light falls upon the alleyway, although a flicker of 
illumination does enter from the street to the north.

Second Level Hallway~
   This room is quite small and cramped, little space between the 
four unpainted and unadorned walls, the centre of the floor being 
taken up by a hardy yet plain staircase leading downward. The 
faint smell of incense and oil resides here, the former arriving 
from below and the later cast by a small lamp hanging in the 
north-east corner of the ceiling. Three doors are set in the 
walls, one in each the north, west and south.

Wide-set Room~
   Blue paint of a dark hue has been painted onto the walls and
ceiling in some distant time, now peeling off here and there.
The walls of the room have been set a fair distance apart from
one another, giving this space an unrestrained feeling to it.
In each corner lies a long candle stick, each supporting a small
bee's-wax candle atop of it, the wick blackened. The smell of stale
beer and smoke hangs in the air, and a small door set in the north
wall leads out of the room.

Tight Office~
   The wooden timbers of the walls have been laid vertically 
together, bare except for a faint tinge of mauve paint around the 
door frame set in the eastern wall. A weighty oak door with a 
large lock and iron bolt rests on heavy hinges in the frame. 
There is little spare room in the office left from the furniture 
and a single candle-stand in the corner. A set of shutters set 
in the western wall have been well maintained, and like the door 
bear a large bolt.

Storage Room~
   Numerous shelves and barrels have been crammed into this small 
room in an effort to bring the maximum possibly storage space in 
the smallest area. The wooden walls, ceiling and floor are bare, 
save for a slightly rotten section of timber in the roof 
indicating a leaking of water. A small door opens outward from 
the store room to the south.

Filthy Passageway~
   Most of the space between the four grime-streaked walls is 
occupied by the rickety staircase, the steps ascending to the low 
roof where they stop, looking as if construction of a larger 
building was halted midway. The sounds and smells of the tavern 
below drift freely up the narrow spiral of half-rotted wooden 
steps, and clink of tankards and stench of westmansweed can be 
sensed closeby. Light is cast up from the floor below, no source 
of brightness present within the passageway itself, and long 
shadows stretch out along the hallway. 
   A squat door set in the eastern wall provides the only other 
exit from this squalid hall apart from the descending staircase.

Ale-Scented Room~
   The aroma of stale beer and ale hangs heavily in this room, 
rankling to the nose of those not acquainted with inns, taverns 
and other places of drink. The unpainted wooden walls are set a 
fair distance apart, granting a moderate gap to the furnishings 
of this room, but the roof is low. From beneath the floorboards 
the sound of men and women at drink and rest can be heard. A row 
of four shutters has been set in the east wall, allowing a view 
down onto the squalid alleyway below and the occasional gust of 
foul air. 
   A single door set in the western wall allows access into and 
out of this room.

Open Rooftop~
   To the east and south the dilapidated houses and crumbling 
buildings of the second circle of Minas Tirith stretch out, a 
narrow alley winding between them. A gargantuan over all over 
structures rises up to the north, the pristine, white, stone wall 
of the third circle of the city. The floor here is wooden 
timbers, and a waist-height boundary of pine planks looks to have 
been recently placed around the edge of the rooftop, a small gap 
in the eastern side. The smell of garbage drifts up to the nose 
here, and opposite the roof to the east is the flat roof of a 
charred storehouse. 
   Broken tankards, smashed barrels and generic waste lines the 
available space up here, and a large pile of resin-coated planks 
of wood lay stacked up against the eastern pine fence.

Plank Bridge Over Alleyway~
   The footing here is a thick wooden plank of pine wood 
stretching between two rooftops to the east and west. Directly 
below the plank is a narrow alleyway filled with refuse making a 
crooked path through ramshackle buildings. Knotholes can be seen 
in the resin-coated surface of the plank, which is rather sturdy. 
To the north the huge third wall of Minas Tirith can be seen, and 
south past the two story drop the out lying walls of the fair 
city.

Crumbling Floor~
   The stone walls of this large storehouse are all that remain 
intact now, a thick layer of black soot and ash removing any 
cleanliness they may of once held. The ground floor is covered 
in rubble and ruins. Broken glass, charred hunks of wood, burnt 
leather goods all impede progress and block the door. A few 
crates seemed to have survived in reasonably good order, allowing 
progress from the first floor to what remains of the second, 
mainly a small section of blackened wooden floorboards near the 
trap door that leads up onto the rooftop.

A Wide Stairwell~
   Men and women of the Minas Tirith Guards pass through this 
small compartment to and from the southern archway and the 
stairwell, proud in bearing and walking to the clink of armour. 
A faded banner from a distant war ground has been hung on the 
northern wall upon a series of fine iron hooks, the symbol of the 
White Tree of Gondor just visible upon its ancient surface. In 
the eastern most section of the compartment here is a wide 
spiraling staircase, the stone steps broad enough to hold three 
men abreast at they move upward higher up into the building.

   The stairwell has been located in a small stone compartment 
off the entry hallway that lies through a narrow arch to the 
east. Constructed from the white stone that has been used 
throughout the entire compound, the staircase leads down west 
before cornering north. A tapestry depicting a battle on a 
distant field has been hung on the northern wall, a bronze 
lantern set opposite it. The occasional guardsman ascends or 
descends the staircase and moves to or from the entry hallway.

numerous sacks, crates and barrels of food that will store in 
time. Rice, grain, beans, hard tack and heavily salted meat all 
sit in an orderly fashion upon shelves and racks. Hygiene looks 
to have been kept first in mind throughout the cellar, barely any 
dust visible and no rat holes present in the walls. A trap door 
opens up in the north-eart corner of the wooden ceiling, a ramp 
leading up to the kitchen above.

   Here the stone staircase spirals up and down through the 
central building on the guard compound, in this section of its 
travels joining with a small room that allows access to a hallway 
to the south. Footsteps echo out across the rough stone walls, 
the sign of patrols throughout the hallway to the west, and 
accompanied by the metallic jingle of armor and weaponry. Lamps 
run up and down with the spiraling staircase, casting away all 
shadows for those who would travel upon them.

   A stone chamber has been carved out of the main structure of

steps descend to lower levels. The movement of armoured men and 
woman sound out through the stone walls, this stairwell rather 
lonesome and devoid of human presence. A plush red carpet is 
visible through a stone archway that leads south out of ts small 
chamber into the officer quarters of the main hall of the guard 
compound.

feet. Lamps set in the walls dispel all darkness from the base 
of the staircase here, and further points of light can be seen up 
the stones and to the east as a corridor leads off in that 
direction. Few people pass through here, only the occasional 
armored man or women with a jingle of armor and weapons. The 
stairwell leads straight up to the west before turning to the 
south.

A Dusty Workshop~
   Dusty, and cluttered with scraps of wood, this large, 
rectangular room makes use as the main workshop of this store. 
Unfinished pieces of woodwork leans against the sawdust covered 
stone making up the walls, some stained and drying, others pieced 
together half-way or so. Workers move throughout the workroom, 
leaving footprints in the wooden dust that seems to cover every 
inch of the hardwood floor. A large number of lanterns cast a 
bright light across the room, making it easy for people to detail 
and fit their work. 
   To the north, a finished cedar door opens into the main 
display room of the carpenter's shop, while to the east, a sturdy 
oaken door prevents anyone without the fitting key entrance to 
the storeroom.

from the next. Oil-burnt light is cast through the corridor from 
two lanterns set in the wall via cast iron wall brackets, keeping 
this area free of shadows. In the north, east and south walls 
thick, oak doors set with a tiny barred window lead off to cells,

   A greater distance spreads out from the north and south walls 
of this room then the east and west, giving it the shape of a 
rectangle. A pair of shutters have been set in the southern end 
of the room, overlooking a path below and letting in some fresh 
air into this otherwise stuffy space. Space is plentiful about 
this room's furnishings, and continual light is provided by a 
lantern hanging from the wooden beam ceiling. A door set in the 
eastern wall provides an exit from here.

Sergeant's Office~
   The stone northern and eastern walls of this room are rough in 
texture, their white surfaces far from pristine in condition. A 
pair of thick shutters bearing an iron bolt have been carved a 
space in the east wall, providing a view outside of the office. 
Faint sounds of movement and people stirring are only just 
audible through the unpainted floorboards, and the noise of an 
occasional armored person moving past comes from behind set in 
the south wall.

Third Floor Hallway~
   A spiraling staircase of sturdy and sensible wooden construct 
takes nearly all room available in the south end of this hallway, 
leading down with steps wide enough for three people atime. 
Solid oak doors have been set in the north and west walls, while 
the east and south walls have been built from white stone. The 
roof also has been constructed from stone, the slabs resting of 
thick wooden rafters that stretch across overhead.

Compact Armoury~
   Although only containing a moderate amount of space for 
storage, this armory has been meticulously designed and its 
contents arranged in a painstaking manner to draw the most room 
for the weapons and armor it holds. A small space to stand in 
the centre of the room is ringed with racks, shelves and stands 
in all directions save to the east, where a short walk through 
weapon racks leads to a solid oak door.

A Spacious Office~
   While modest in terms of floor space the white stone walls and 
high ceiling make this office feel large and roomy. A wide 
rectangular window in the stones of the northern wall allows 
natural light to filter in during the daytime while a number of 
lamps on the walls provide ample illumination at night. The 
other three walls are punctuated by doorways, the one to the east 
being particularly sturdy looking and bound in iron. Faint 
sounds of conversation and the movement of armoured people are 
just audible as they filter through from the south.

Ornate Hallway~
   Between the paneled maple-wood doors that run up and down this 
corridor as it leads north and south are numerous relics from 
battles gone by. Chipped swords, ancient war horns and faded 
banners are all examples of the legacy of war that hangs on the 
sky-blue painted walls. A thick red carpet has been laid over 
the wooden floorboards, giving this hallway a regal look to it as 
it passes the offices of rank of the Minas Tirith armed services. 
A set of double doors set in the stone wall to the south leads 
out to a balcony, and a small archway has been set in the eastern 
wall, granting access to a stairwell.

Well Adorned Hallway~
   Save from the occasional patrolling guardsmen this hallway is 
rather quiet. Plush carpet, a ruby red in colour, runs over the 
floorboards as the passage leads north and south, leading past 
the maple doors that give access to officer quarters, names of 
the occupants of the rooms scribed in Gondorian-Tengwar runes 
onto the door. Set on iron stands in the spaces between doors 
are tapestries depicting armed forces of Minas Tirith in battle 
with a multitude of foes, from orcs and goblins to darker, more 
sinister figures. more sinister figures.

in the northern wall. A plush red carpet well pacified by the 
treading feet of patrols runs north to south along the

A set of double doors leads back north into the building, while 
looking to the south, east and north provides a good view of the

A Simple Kitchen~
   Modest and somewhat cramped, this kitchen is nevertheless kept 
clean and tidy. The walls are painted a light cream, and the 
floor is planked hardwood, nicked and scarred over years of wear. 
The smells of cooking herbs and spices are ever prevalent here, 
and combined with the heat from the hearth, can get almost 
overpowering at times. The ceiling is somewhat smokestained, 
though otherwise clean. A large wood-framed charcoal drawing 
hangs on an otherwise empty wall.

stone. It smells musty and earthy, the walls and everything
present covered in a layer of fine soot. Along the western
edge of the ceiling, a blackened metal cover resides over a
wide chimney of sorts, diverting smoke and alot of soot out
of the cellar when possible. A solid staircase exists in the
north-eastern corner, leading up to a simple trapdoor.

sweet scent of jasmine to the air, helping to combat the smells 
of the streets outside.

An Enclave in the Wall~
   The battlements curve around to the west here, creating a 
small shaded enclave between the walls. This area has been 
secluded as a small loading zone for a cart that travels from 
gate to gate carrying passengers in exchange for a donation. A 
wooden bench stands against one of the walls, where several 
commoners impatiently await their transportation. Some straw had 
been shaken off of the cart and now lies in a small pile in the 
center of the enclave.

suitable for all kinds of food preparation. A low archway leads

While not nearly thick enough to keep the worst ravages of the

A number of moderately dressed people mill about, examining the 
small works of art set about on makeshift counters. A large flap 
opens up to the south onto the market square, whilst a smaller 
flap is set in the northern end of the tent.

   One of the White City's ubiquitous enclaves for its transport
carts, this area nonetheless seems lacking in the fairly decent

over the parched earth lining the dull grey cobbles of the road
nearby, and the buildings seen rising up on all sides are quite
evidently dilapidated and many years out of repair.

Remains of a Kitchen~
   A ruined wreck of a kitchen is here, littered with ashes and 
covered in smoke. The wooden floor is scorched, making footing 
dangerous. The one thing that seems to have survived is the 
cellar. The roof has collapsed against the blackened stone 
walls, and is now open to the sky.

Each of the tiles is roughly the size of a human palm.  They are masterfully 
painted with interlocking, blue and white, geometric designs.  The style is 
very reminiscent of that of the near Haradrim tile artisans.

A Cold and Dry Cellar~
   A narrow staircase leads from the wooden trapdoor above 
towards the cold grey stone floor. A rough railing parallels the 
stairs, allowing someone to safely descend without a light. The 
cellar is very dry and somewhat chilly. A variety of large beer 
kegs compliments the extensive wine racks arranged against the 
eastern and southern walls. There are several dozen bags of 
grain piled beneath the staircase.

Blasted Ruins of a Dormitory~
   The blackened, smoked out ruins of a large room is here. The
floor is severely weakened by fire damage. The damage is worse
to the south, where the walls are literally powdered to ash.

A Fire-Damaged Garden~
   A half-grown birch tree extends along the northern wall of 
this small encased garden. The garden is pleasantly shaded 
during most of the day, with the bright light only penetrating 
during the peak hours. There are two miniature furrows 
stretching north to south planted with a variety of cooking 
herbs. The area is fire-damaged to the east, though most of the 
garden itself has survived.

This small enclosed garden is saturated by a heavy fog. A 
half-grown birch tree, barely visible from anywhere except in its 
immediate proximity, stretches out along the northern wall. On 
the ground, planted with a variety of cooking herbs, there are 
two miniature furrows ready to trip the unwary fog-blinded 
wanderer.

   A naked half-grown birch tree extends along the northern wall

the searing blizzard, with most of the snow uneventfully 
accumulating against one of the walls. There are two small 
mounds in the snow stretching from the north to the south.

The Rath Celerdain Toolmaker~
   The walls of this small, one-room shop have been decorated,
not with pretty colored objects, but with various kinds of tools.
Tools for almost any purpose can be found here. A long counter
set against the southern wall is littered with tools of every
sort and size. A small door to the west leads back out to the
street. It is a well-arranged space, with plenty of light and
fresh air.

The Cook's Helper~
   This bright, inviting shopfront is the lower floor of a larger 
building. The walls are painted bright white, and are very 
clean. The floor is tiled and thrown with rushes to soften 
footfalls and smell good. All along the walls are neatly spaced 
rows of shelves and racks, each holding kitchen tools for the 
busy cook. The main door leads south, to the plaza.

A Large, Paved Courtyard~
   This large, open courtyard is paved all over with smooth, 
rounded cobblestones. Unlike the street outside, they are in 
random patterns, with many different colours being present. 
Despite the fact that the courtyard is paved, some green is 
visible in the cracks of the stones where grass has somehow 
managed to grow. A sprawling stone building extends to the west, 
looking old but solid, well-made and well-maintained. A sturdy, 
iron gate leads back into the street, and an iron-barred door 
leads into the manor.

   Polished stone floors and clean, wood-panelled stone walls 
make this room cool in summer and warm in winter. While fairly 
sparse, with no carpets or tapestries, the room is fairly 
welcoming. Rafters are visible underneath the high ceiling, and 
torches are set in bronze wall-sconces to provide light. An 
iron-barred door leads out into the courtyard. West, the hallway 
extends.

An Opulent Study~
   Lavishly decorated, this rooms seems to take fashion over 
functionality, as most surfaces are occupied by expensive-looking 
accessories and trinkets. An ornate settee sits in one corner, 
covered with plush pillows. Bookcases pushed against two of the 
walls are filled with books and antique bookends. Thick, velvet 
curtains of a dark red hue are mounted on a set of windows to the 
north.

stone floors and clean, wood-panelled stone walls make it cool

   Cluttered worktables and boiling hot stoves make this kitchen 
hot and sweaty to work in. Shelves and cupboards store things 
that aren't being used, and a trapdoor in a back corner of the 
room leads downstairs. There seems to be less effort made in 
keeping this room clean, and a thin layer of grime is visible on 
most surfaces.

A white, marble fireplace and mantle is set in the center of the 
western wall, with a large mirror hung above it. Spread across 
the floor is a thick, patterned carpet. Gossamer, white curtains 
cover the double-doors that open out into a patio outside. 
   A wide staircase against the northern wall leads up to a 
landing on the second floor.

even intervals along the walls are sconces holding thick candles, 
keeping the passage lit with their soft, flickering glow. The

Gondor Dyes~
   This large, spacious shop is the lower floor of a stone 
building. This room is the selling floor of the shop, with 
hardwood floors, panelled walls, and a high ceiling. Plenty of 
light illumines the goods for sale, dyes in various kinds of 
bottles and jars set on the shelves. Each dye has its own 
special place, with a piece of wool hanging below it to display 
the dye's color. The dyes are even arranged by color, with reds 
toward one end of the shop, progressing through the rainbow to 
the other. The air smells of the pungent and sometimes sharp 
dyes, cut with a floral scent.

Inside the Gates of Minas Tirith~
   At the Great Gates of Minas Tirith, the city is buzzing with 
activity of every kind. Guards stand sentry over the city above, 
pacing vigilantly back and forth on the impregnable walls of 
stone. Merchants vend their wares in a strident competition to 
be overheard. Farmers push their wains, overburdened with fresh 
produce, over the cobblestones. To the east lie the Great Gates, 
while a massive open market opens up to the west. Rath 
Celerdain, the Lampwright's street, runs around the city just to 
the west.

   The cacophony of sounds and cocktail of smells that is Minas 
Tirith's Plaza of the Sun assail the senses from all around, 
transient vendors from all over Gondor assemble to peddle their 
wares to those who enter Tirith's Gates. Nearby, a stand covered 
with pies of all sorts stands, carefully watched over by its 
owner as a number of citizens poke, prod, and purchase the 
various forms of sustenance.

A Well-Furnished Dining Hall~
   This spacious dining hall is enclosed within four fine 
oak-paneled walls, each boasting entry to another room beyond. 
The sounds and activity of the common room just off to the east 
often penetrate to this hall, making it rarely quiet when paired 
with the sounds of people passing through here as well. The 
wooden floors underfoot look to be new, kept clean and well- 
swept, reflecting the care of the tapestries hung along the 
northern and southern walls on either side of the doorways there. 
These tapestries depict epic battle scenes from both past and 
present, looking to be recently restored in some cases, and newly 
made in others. A large fireplace sits in the southwestern 
corner of the hall, a smooth oak mantle above holding decorative 
drinking flagons, warming the room at all times.

A Large, Immaculate Kitchen~
   Large windows on the northern and western walls provide ample 
light during the day, and when paired with the light the ovens 
and lanterns provide, this kitchen remains brightly lit at all 
hours of the day. A myriad of smells fill the air, from food and 
drink alike, filling this room and seeming to drift southward 
towards the dining room there. A trapdoor made of a solid, 
dark-colored wood leads downwards to the cellar.

A Small Cellar~
   The majority of light that manages to penetrate the darkness 
of this cellar comes from above, when the wooden trapdoor leading 
into the kitchen is open. The scents and sounds of that room 
linger here, seeming to echo against the jagged-looking walls 
that seem to have been hewn by chisel alone. Shelves and racks 
line the walls, providing places to store items needed for 
everyday use. South, a doorway leads into a brewery, while to 
the east lies the storage room used for prepared goods and those 
ready to be sold.

"The Watchman's Retreat"~
   This tavern operates from a rather large stone building, a 
sizable hearth in the southern wall effectively combating the 
cold of the stone. A thin haze of Westmansweed and the 
smell of fresh ale reigns supreme here, the subdued patrons doing 
little but occupying seats and consuming alcohol. The stone 
walls have been adorned with the various markings of the Minas 
Tirith Guard and with different, shields bearing the heraldry of
many regions and outfits. The patrons that consistently fill the
tavern seem more focused on their drinks than the decor. The
tavern's moniker comes from the large number of Guards that
seem to make this their stopping place, which seems to have a 
few of these patrons at all times. A stout, iron banded door 
leads out from the north wall to the street.

The Center of Merchant's Plaza~
   Rising out of the center of the cobbled, small triangular 
plaza here is a stone fountain, ancient but rather well-kept. 
The plaza, full of vendors of all walks of life, stretches toward 
its points northward, southward, and eastward, the small throngs 
of shoppers drifting amongst the merchants in a sea of shouts and 
cries. Westward, a number of ancient stone dwellings lie, rather 
nondescript and squat, circling the cul-de-sac in its entirety.

A Lavish, Well-Appointed Room Behind the Leaking Barrel Tavern~
   Well-appointed and rather comfortable, this back room's 
appearance highly contrasts the tavern's dull facade. Expensive 
candle chandeliers hang from the high ceiling above each finely 
made table, and a warm fireplace adorns the southern wall. 
Another bar inhabits the western wall, this one much more 
generously stocked, bottles of all shapes and sizes filling the 
Faint noises, the sounds of men and women at rest, drift in from 
the north. 
   A thick door of mahogany lies in the northern wall, a small 
rectangular slat placed near its top. Another, more compact 
door, lies in the eastern wall, the lock polished and 
complicated.

Inside A Darkly-Stained Oak Carriage~
   Somewhat understated, the decor inside this carriage reflects 
the modesty of its owners. The walls are panelled with smoothly 
polished, darkly-stained oak. Several small, glass-paned windows 
afford a view of the world outside. Plushly stuffed leather 
upholstered seats, arranged facing one another, provide 
comfortable seating for one to four occupants. Two brass-handled 
doors allow passengers to embark and disembark with relative 
ease.

The Stables of the Steward's Path~
   This stone stable is airy, its white walls and floor giving it
even more room. High-ceilinged, its loft visible through some steps
leading upward, it has plenty of room for the horses of those who
travel this part of the city. The people wandering through here are,
for the most part, exquisitely dressed, most of them noble. Some 
sweet-scented straw strewn with herbs covers the white stone floor,
leading out to the finely-cobbled street outside.

Rath Mardil North of the Houses of Healing~
   The aged, yet closely-fitted, elegant basalt and rough 
marble that make the street of Rath Mardil here are 
accompanied by the fragrant, invigorationg smell of a lush,
magnific garden that is maintained outside of the great
Houses of Healing, the center of the most advanced and
old medical knowledge in the West. Only the richest of
Minas Tirith, and those in direct service to the Steward,
be it in War or other pursuits, can expect to be treated
inside this place.

Sharp Curve West and South in Rath Mardil~
   Large, flat stones of glinting white rock are fitted 
together without a hairs-width between them, making the
street here smooth and even to travel upon. Everyone who
passes you on the street is clean and well-dressed without
exception. The homes here are more spacious, with walled
gardens and multi-story estates beyond them. Trees, planted
among the varied yards, make this area seem less populated
despite its position further up the mountainous expanse of
city that is Minas Tirith.

Rath Eradan Curving East and North~
   Clean, well-kept pale cobblestones, all tightly fitted, make up
this wide, curving street through Minas Tirith's Fifth Circle. Running
past exquisitely made houses and a few necessary shops, it winds from
north to east. People moving through here tend to be well-dressed,
with a mixture of government officials and nobility mingling with the
servants on their errands. Carriages and horses can also be seen, all
of the highest quality. This circle is one of the smaller ones, but
even so, there is plenty of room, giving it a spacious, restful feel.
White walls skirt the circle, but the view is incredible, both of the
city and of the faraway mountains.
   A small plaza opens up to the west.

   Here, the Gates of Fifth Circle open to the sprawling street
of Rath Eradan, whose well-kept and clean cobblestones twist west
and south. With the fantastic view of the city below, and the White
Tower above, the city looks like a fairy-tale castle come to life, 
all in white. The walls of the Fourth and Sixth circles skirt this
district, visible beyond the fine homes and shops. The gate can be
seen to the east, looming large and sturdily, carved all along
its length and girth along the white stone. Traffic through here
is not heavy, but composed entirely of very well-dressed citizens
and nobility.

traffic grows much heavier as Rath Eradan approaches the gates

Rath Eradan Between Large Stone Manors~
   The flagstones of Rath Eradan stretch east and west, traversed 
by well-dressed citizens of Minas Tirith. The residential area 
here is dominated by large manors of clean white stone, like most 
of the city. A few of the manors have a small grassy lawn, with 
a path that spills out onto the street here. Watchful guards, 
dressed in bright mail, frequently pass through the area, their 
keen eyes searching for signs of trouble. The lamp posts 
bordering the street cast a flickering light on the area during 
the night.

Along Rath Eradan on the Fifth Circle~
   The well-cobbled street here moves in a straight line from the 
east to the west. Several well-kept houses and manors line the 
street, and their occupants pass in and out at random intervals. 
Lamp posts of black iron stand sentinel along the edges of the 
white stone path, giving an air of nobilty to the atmosphere. 
Not far to the west, the slopes of Mount Mindolluin dwarf a large 
manor at the end of Rath Eradan.

Rath Eradan Ending at a Sumptuous Manor~
   The traffic here thins considerably, and is nearly 
nonexistant, save the occasional guard passing. The 
white-cobbled street here is clean and less worn than most places 
in the city. Black iron lamp posts line the street at even 
intervals, casting the area in a dim light at night. To the 
west, a sumptuous manor looms, a gate leading into the courtyard 
before it. Behind the manor, the slopes of Mount Mindolluin 
stretch toward the sky.

Beneath the Fifth Circle Gatehouse~
   Travelling southwest on its path deeper and deeper into the 
city of Minas Tirith, the great Capitol of Gondor, the 
cobblestone road seems only to get finer and more well-kept. 
Trash and midden heaps that plague the lower circles seem to be 
virtually non-existant in these upper levels, even moreso in 
Fifth Circle than in Fourth. The towering, several-story gates 
in the wall allow egress southwest and northeast, into Fifth and 
Fourth Circles respectively. A number of City Guardsmen 
constantly pace back and forth, looking over the rather paltry 
number of passersby with an unsurpassed, but probably not 
unnecessary, scrutiny.

Inside a Small Clothier's Stand~
   The walls of this small stand have been painted white, though 
this is now peeling and cracked, bearing a faintly yellowish 
tinge. An old, worn wooden counter extends from one makeshift 
wall, surface scratched with use. Rickety racks propped against 
the rest of the walls bear numerous articles of worn, used, and 
otherwise third-rate clothing and wearables. The floor is 
relatively clear of debris, while some of the floorboards are 
warped or separated. Many ill-dressed customers move in and out 
from the street at most hours of the day, though the stand 
remains far from crowded.

By a Dilapidated Wain~
   In the midst of a small, cramped lot here there can be seen an 
old, dilapidated wain. It is constructed of worn timbers; some 
are splintered or off-kilter, the wagon looking as if it will 
barely roll. A menagerie of mixed pots, jars, and other clay 
goods are carefully displayed in its back, which is turned toward 
the street for better visibility. The lot itself is rather 
squalid, fitting in with the surrounding buildings and street, 
and a few commoners pass by at all hours of the day, going about 
their business.

Back Corner of a Run-Down Warehouse~
   This corner, set in the very back of the warehouse, has been 
set aside for the use of a large mill, which takes up nearly the 
entire area. The area is dimly lit, a few small braziers on the 
back wall supplementing what little light filters in from the 
front. Stacks of unprocessed logs sit nearby, waiting to be 
sawed into lumber, and large piles of sawdust surround the mill, 
some drifting into the rest of the warehouse. There is little 
room for movement other than to manipulate the mill, and the air 
here is thick with dust.

Interior of a Hide-Dealer's Shop~
   The pungent smell of curing leather permeates the whole of 
this small shop from corner to corner. Lining the walls and set 
up on the floor are many large boards on which pelts of varying 
quality and size have been stretched out to dry. Several large 
jars made of clay have been placed close to the walls of the 
room, some of them containing hides steeping in the water. 
Although fairly well-kept, the building shows obvious signs of 
decay; some of the unpainted boards that make up the walls are 
worn and separating slightly. A consistent stream of traffic 
moves in and out of the building, perusing the displayed wares.

The Clever Cut~
   The walls in this shop are constructed from stout lumber, 
though their natural wooden colour has long since faded to a dull 
grey. The roof is slightly sunken in the middle, though still 
watertight. Blotchy reddish stains dot the floor at intervals, 
evidence of what occurs here, and the counter that extends from 
the wall is covered in grisly red patches and is most often lined 
with meats waiting to be butchered or sold. A few commoners can 
be seen making purchases at most hours of the day.

A Squalid Pawn Shop~
   Quite cramped and crowded, this room is filled with a clutter 
of odds and ends. Racks and shelves line the walls, containing 
multitudes of used and discarded items for resale. The 
floorboards are scarred and worn with age, and the once white 
paint that covers the walls is now yellowish and starting to peel 
off, leaving small piles of flakes along the floor. Those who 
frequent this shop tend to be the common and the poor; seldom 
will one see anyone finely-dressed.

A Pungent Stable~
   The pungent smell of manure is prominent in this stable, 
likely from lack of ventilation. It is not very well-kept, and 
the building is in a state of disrepair, some of the boards 
cracked or splintered. The floor is covered in a light 
scattering of straw, though cakes of manure can be seen amongst 
it, as well as the occasional rat or insect. 
   The barn extends back to several stalls where horses are kept, 
whinnies and snorts audible at most hours.

the vendors continually shout and hawk with their would-be 
customers, attempting to draw attention to themselves - and from 
their opposition. 
   The plaza continues toward the south, while to the north, a

alcove filled with throngs of people buying, selling, and arguing 
about the both of them. Shouts and cries of unhappy 
bargain-hunters and stolid merchants pierce the air throughout 
the day and night. The outer wall of Minas Tirith curves 
unhindered from the northeast to the southwest, bringing an 
abrupt end to the marketplace. A number of stands are set up, 
many using the great wall as one of their own. A door carved 
with a pawn stands solidly to the west, while the bustle of 
Merchant's Way lies to the south.

A Pond at the Base of a Cliff~
   Fresh, crisp, and clean water pools about the base of this 
cliff-face of Mount Mindolluin, creating a serene tribute to the 
graves and cairns of this peaceful and mostly-undisturbed grove 
and graveyard. A stark contrast to the rest of the city, the 
only sounds one can hear at most times is the trickle of water 
into this pond from a slow creek about thirty feet or so above, 
pouring down from Mindolluin's heights to seep into the cliff
here. A wrought-iron fence to the south separates the area from
an old, tall manor.

water flora, and the occasional minnow. An occasional bubble 
from a turtle or some other kind of waterly fauna floats its way 
upward, where the water gives way to the air; to the north,
the waters lead beneath a rocky overhang.

west, however, a metal shaft large enough for a large man allows 
water to filter through, past an ancient, rusted grate. The 
south leads back toward the openness of the pond.

   Curving walls of stone fall back to the west, joining to form 
the borders of the main floor of a large warehouse. The packed 
dirt ground is crossed with numerous cart tracks, and littered 
with stacks of crates, sacks and boxes that join to create 
numerous aisles and passageways through the enclosure. The 
atmosphere of the space, in spite of the clutter, is open and 
cool. The lofty roof above is shadowed by a complex of wooden 
ceiling beams, illuminated by the light of a dozen braziers near 
which a number of carts and workers cluster. The clamour of the 
warehouse rings through the area, and spills out onto the streets 
to the east through the only point of entry - two large square 
doors of heavy, furnished oak.

seperating the fourth and fifth circle. The drive twists around 
a small garden plot, raised up in the center, with an old and 
stately cherry tree, and south into a more lush garden with a 
hedge maze. The manor itself is two stories of pristine white 
stone with a single turret rising up from the back, sporting a 
large wrap around balcony.

   Broad double doors of sturdy, polished oak lead into this

well as ample space to park a wagon, this area is open and 
comfortable. There is plenty of space beside for storage, roomy 
enough to mount and dismount as well as hitch or unhitch the 
wagon without having to go outside. Made of pale, polished oak 
construction, the floors are rammed earth and well cleaned. 
While gently worn in places through decades or perhaps centuries 
of use, it is all well tended and maintained. A broad, shallow 
set of stairs lead up into a loft above.

   This large kitchen looks like it was designed for a place 
several times the size of even this large manor. Stove, 
fireplace, tables, shelves, the room seems designed for space and 
efficiency without giving up any comforts. The room also seems 
connected to everywhere else in the house, the gardens, hall, 
servants quarters and the small office to the north, adding a 
cozy, central feel to this part of the house. Windows on the 
west wall open up into the garden and its little pond, while 
stairs in the corner lead down into the cellar. The windows are 
set into a small round bay, making a very pleasant little 
breakfast nook out of the way of anyone passing through or making

than one might expect, arched supports run up the walls and rows 
of shelves run through the middle of the cellar. A work table is 
set against the northern wall, the rest of the room is devoted to 
storage. Brass wall sconces, set with lanterns, help keep it 
bright and easy to find things.

A Vaulted-Ceilinged Great Hall~
   This grand dining hall fills the center of the manor. The 
second floor balcony encircles it, while the cathedral ceilings 
are set with skylights, reflecting off the gleaming white stone 
to make the whole room bright and cheery. A huge chandelier is 
hung by several chains, strung through loops on the high ceiling, 
over the center of the room, higher than the balconies edge on 
the second floor. This allows the large fixture to illuminate 
both the hall and the balcony above, and yet still able to be 
lowered for cleaning or to replace its many candles. The stone 
floors and walls give the room a strong accoustical presence, 
carrying even soft words and footfalls to every corner of the 
hall.

Spacious Balcony Over the Great Hall~
   Two curving stone stairs from the north and south side of the 
foyer curl up from below. Wide, spacious and open, the whole 
structure is made of a gleaming, brightly polished white stone, 
with carved arches supporting the pointed cathedral ceiling. Bay 
windows between the stairs landing in the east wall give a 
magnificient view of the drive and the whole of Minas Tirith 
beyond. The great hall below is seen easily over the railing 
while doors to private staterooms, polished white oak and fitted 
with silver, open up to the north, west and south. A small table 
and chairs are set under the eastern bay windows, creating a 
comfortable and well lit place to sit.

that has been well polished. Silver inlay on the door itself in

treatments, the rich ocean blue rug with ornate silver trim, all

over the gardens below, while a curling stone stair leads up into

   On top of a high three story structure, the top of this spire 
actually reaches above the wall seperating the fourth and fifth 
circle. The view it provides is absolutely magnificent, the 
White Tower rising up, further up the tiered rings of Minas 
Tirith to the southwest, the rest of the city sprawling off away 
and below. The Pelennor fields, the Rammas Echor, even the 
distant woods of the Anorien can be seen on the horizon. Closer 
by, the drive, and gardens, even the street approaching the manor 
can easily be observed from this vantage.

city you see the Pelennor, great tracks of farmland, and beyond
that the massive form of the Rammas Echor. Smatterings of fields
can be seen beyond its barrier walls, and the distant green of

   This spacious lawn and garden starts on the south side of
the manor and curves around behind the west side. A little path 
of white stones waves among a few trees to a little foot bridge,
crossing a small pond out to a tiny island in the middle. A huge
willow tree grows from its center, boughs like a curtain around
it, brushing the water. Planted all about with flowers, a small
private bench sits under the willow overlooking the pond. Tucked
away among the trees is a latticed gazebo with a wide hammock in
it, sheltered from the rain and sun, shaded and comfortable.

walled along its edges with wrought-iron and hedges. Set with 
trees and carved stone benches around the winding stone paths all 
through here, it boasts a number of unusual flowers and shrubs, 
as well as trees not commonly seen in Gondor. The presence of 
guards is easily seen, but they are unobtrusive, allowing guests 
to take their ease away from the stress of shopping in the nearby 
plaza. This area is very rarely empty of visitors, even at 
night, during good weather. Lamps set along the paths have an 
archaic look, gracefully arching upward, and some have rosebushes 
growing up along their length to form arches here and there.

   This very large park is spacious and genteel in appearance, 
walled along its edges with wrought-iron and hedges. The trees
and shrubs are dormant now, mostly, except for the few evergreen
species, and most of these are not easily seen due to the soft white
blanket of snow covering the park. Few people are here, though there
are still a few guards patrolling at regular intervals. The overall
impression most guests here would get is one of dormancy; the sleeping
plant life is barely visible, making the park seem particularly empty,
its wrought-iron fencing particularly stark against the pale snow.

   The smell of fine scents and incense wafts down this stretch
of the arcade. A large brass incense burner hangs outside an arched
portal to the north, which leads to the source of the perfume. There
is a quiet, restful, serene air to this area, with its tall white
marble columns and its checkerboard slate and limestone tiles. The
surroundings dwarf the many visitors. Each person visible is well-
dressed, many of them noble in appearance, but they all speak in quiet
tones as they browse the shops along the arcade.

The Starlight Perfumery~
   More reminiscent of a library than a merchant's boutique, the 
walls of this small shop are lined with tall walnut bookcases. 
Each case contains a dozen shelves with rows of small vials, 
bottles, jars and candles neatly arrayed upon the them. There is 
a cacophony and clash of sweet and subtle perfumes, pot-pourris 
and candles which fills the air, wafting out of the arched 
doorway. In the centre of the shop is a small counter where 
samples and testers lie scattered about, testament to the 
demanding nature of the shopkeeper's clients. An exquisite 
stained-glass door leads back out to the arcade, its colors 
bright to contrast with the pure white walls and tiled floor.

The Starlight Delicatessen~
   The walls, floor and ceiling of this small boutique have been 
clad in red and black streaked white marble. The marble has been 
polished to such a degree as to reflect the light. Behind a 
great glass covered counter fine pates, cooked meats and pungent 
cheeses have been decoratively arranged upon white porcelain 
plates and dishes. Fresh kale, parsley, and coriander garnishes 
the wares behind the counter. Sitting on top of the counter in 
small straw baskets are clutches of small eggs from quails, 
pigeons, and other game birds. An antique-looking oak door 
stands to the north, carved with foxes and trees.

The Silver Spice Shop~
   Wooden panels of cedar and a pinewood floor give this shop a 
rustic appearance. The spices, dried fruits and herbs of this 
boutique are displayed in a haphazard fashion: hung from fake 
wooden beams by brass hooks, cast into wicker baskets or 
scattered into straw bowls. A single hooded lantern provides the 
whole of the shop's illumination further complementing the rustic 
and rural feel of the place. The shop is very quiet, few people 
come and go and those that do seem to leave with very small 
packages, wrapped carefully.

An Expensive-Looking Warehouse~
   This expansive, well-made warehouse is constructed of white oak,
with sturdy walls and a high roof. It smells faintly of fur and
wood. Shuttered windows can be opened to let in the light and air,
but the main door is a large gate to the north that opens to the 
street, allowing easy access to all the caravans and merchants
winding their way up to the Fourth Circle.

The Entrance to the Annon Borough Baths~
   Fine white tiles lead from the ornate door to the south off to 
oval-shaped corridors leading east and west to bathing rooms. 
The air smells perpetually of water and all sorts of scented 
soap. Large windows, glazed with diamond panes, let in air and 
light, but they are all high-placed along the walls, so nobody 
can look in. Clean and pristine-looking, this foyer gives an 
indication of the rest of the building. 
   The curtain to the east depicts a woman in fine, archaic 
clothing. The curtain to the west depicts a noble-looking man of 
seeming Numenorean descent in equally fine, archaic clothing.

The Eastern Bathing Pool~
   White tiles cover the floor in tight patterns, faint 
variations in color and shape picking out a detail of swirling 
stars and a path leading from the curtain to a very large, 
rounded bathing pool. The pool is an oval, bisected by a wall to 
the west, and it graduates from shallow to about chest-depth as 
it approaches the wall. All around its raised edges are ferns 
and flowering plants, planted in long marble boxes. Though 
nothing specifically feminine is set here, the overall feel of 
the bathing chamber is one of delicate sensation and self- 
indulgence.

walls and floor of this austere office. Great crates of ore and 
ingots sit waiting for customers. The provider of raw shipped 
goods for weapons, armor, the Malreds also own rich veined mines. 
They supply Gondor with ingots of iron, steel, bronze, silver, 
copper and gold.

sign~
In order to buy from these four merchants, you use them as normal shopkeepers. However you are actually seeing crates with set numbers of each good in them. You buy a whole crate. The prices vary from order to order that the merchant gets in. Sometimes the prices are low, sometimes not so low. To buy the crate, shop as normal then "drop crate" when you want to empty the crate. It must be dropped. Then type "empty crate" and the goods will appear! The deliveries are emptied out at the first of every month so make sure you come and see what has randomly arrived before then.

A Crate-Lined, Stone Storeroom~
   Labelled crates and bins have been piled high in this small, 
stone-walled storeroom, each containing ingots of iron, copper, 
and all other metals. The room itself is rather dusty due to the 
nature of the housed goods though it is well-lit by numerous 
lanterns affixed to the walls. A heavy iron-barred door to the 
south serves as the room's only entrance or exit.

A Lavish Entry Hall to the Warehouse~
   This lavish entry-hall has been designed to impress, serving 
as the gateway to the warehouse proper. Though the timbers and 
stones from which it is built are plainly cut, someone has given 
a great deal of thought to the room's decorations. Both doorways 
are guarded by a pair of elaborate stone vases, standing taller 
than most children. The eastern wall is concealed behind an 
elaborate tapestry, depicting men and women in gorgeous clothing 
partaking in a hunt of some sort, the foreground taken up by a 
massive white stag. The entry hall's floor is partially 
concealed behind a series of throw rugs, some beautifully tended 
furs and others elegant and elaborately patterned pieces. The 
ceiling is high and squared-off, the only portion of this room 
which has escaped decoration and stands as a monument to 
simplicity.

least twice as big as those who hunt it.

A Massive Warehouse Filled With Goods~
   This room is, in a word, massive. Its massive, domed ceiling, 
is a feat of engineering, a throw-back to earlier days. The room 
is filled with tall shelves, requiring ladders to reach their 
highest points. Each of these shelves is brimming with goods of 
all sorts, and along the northern end of the shelves is a long 
series of crates, presumably containing yet more goods. Empty 
crates are stacked neatly on the western wall. The eastern wall 
houses a series of large glass windows, which look out onto the 
wall of the building next-door. The floor is simple, square-cut 
gray stone, laid tightly together and not needing mortar. There 
is no ostentation in this busy room, its simple structuring 
giving it a more business-like feel than the entry hall to the 
south.

Alehouse Taproom~
   The ceiling of the alehouse taproom suddenly grows taller as 
you step through the low arch that leads to the commons. With a 
constant crowd of poorly dressed patrons, be it dawn or dusk, the 
alehouse taproom is a popular gathering place for common folk and 
those down on their luck who seek to forget their troubles over a 
tankard of cheap ale. A haze of pipeweed smoke mingles with the 
smell of stale ale and the aroma of middling fare prepared in the 
alehouse cookery. With dim lighting provided by a few tarnished 
brass lanterns, it's near impossible to judge the time of day due 
to the lack of windows in the taproom. The rough-hewn wood plank 
walls and ceiling that enclose the room appear to be an addition 
to the original alehouse structure. Some of the floorboards 
under one of the benches are slightly buckled. A door set in the 
west wall leads to the cookery and a low arch to the north leads 
through to the original alehouse common room.

Alehouse Cookery~
   A cold, stone slab floor and rough-hewn wooden planks on the 
walls and ceiling enclose this small alehouse cookery. Just 
large enough to accommodate a small hearth and other basic pieces 
of furniture and equipment used to prepare the middling fare 
served to the alehouse patrons. The room is windowless and lit 
by the golden light cast off by the greasy candles ensconced 
inside several strategically placed tarnished brass lanterns. 
The materials and construction of this room appear less worn and 
aged than the alehouse commons, apparently a later addition to 
the original structure. A heavy door set in the eastern wall 
provides egress into the taproom, a small door to the west 
provides access to the cookery's walk in pantry, and a narrow 
door set in the northern wall leads to a private office.

A Drab Office~
   Drab beige, plaster-coated walls, a rough-hewn wood plank 
ceiling and floor enclose this small space. Large enough to 
accommodate a few pieces of furniture and a small hearth, this 
room serves dual purpose as an office and a living space. A 
wooden key rack built into one wall holds keys to the lodgings 
situated above the alehouse. A small window bearing sturdy iron 
bars is built into the western wall, allowing some daylight to 
creep into the room. A pair of poorly dyed, olive-green curtains 
covers the window. It is apparent that the materials and 
construction of this room are relatively new and part of a recent 
addition to the original alehouse structure. A narrow door set 
in the southern wall leads out to the alehouse cookery while a 
small door set in the eastern wall provides access to the 
reception desk and original alehouse common room.

A Dark, Cramped Cellar~
This dark cellar is used to store dry goods and other 
perishables used in the alehouse cookery. The rough-hewn wooden 
walls are lined with rows of shelving and several sturdy, 
rough-hewn wooden beams support the ceiling. The air is cool and 
dry, the stone slab floor is cold to the touch. A steep wooden 
staircase leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling. A crack in the 
stone floor runs down the middle of the cellar, a hatch placed
in the middle of the floor.

The Other Side Alehouse Brewery~
   A smooth, stone slab floor and rough-hewn wood plank walls 
enclose the alehouse brewery. Several rough-hewn wood beams 
support the ceiling, through which the sounds of footsteps and 
the voices of alehouse patrons filter down any time of the day or 
night. Several evenly spaced tarnished brass lanterns are 
affixed to the walls and keep the work area well illuminated. 
Rows of vats and equipment used to brew ale and distill spirits 
are scattered about the room. The air is dank with the heady 
aroma of hops, malt and fermenting ale, assaulting the senses as 
soon as you enter. A door to the west leads to a private office 
and another door to the south leads to the storage cellar and keg 
room. A steep winding staircase leads upstairs to the original 
alehouse common room.

Alehouse Cellar~
   Long rows of sturdy, rough-hewn wood plank shelving line the 
walls of this rectangular cellar. The air is heavy with the 
aroma of cheap spirits and fermenting ale. Several covered vats 
are lined up in rows on the cool, stone slab floor. The muffled 
sounds of alehouse patrons enjoying themselves in the taproom 
above, heavy footsteps and chair legs scraping across the 
floorboards filter down through the ceiling any time of the day 
or night. Sturdy rough-hewn wood beams support the ceiling. A 
door to the north leads to the alehouse brewery and one to the 
south provides access to the keg room.

A Bleak Office~
   A narrow, ground level window allows some daylight to seep 
into this small room. Iron bars protecting the window prevent 
unwelcome visitors from gaining access to the area. A pair of 
poorly dyed, drab-grey curtains can be drawn across the window to 
provide privacy. The muffled sounds of footsteps and voices of 
the alehouse patrons filter down through the ceiling almost any 
time of the day or night. A recent coat of beige paint covers 
the freshly plastered walls; several rough-hewn wooden beams 
support the ceiling. Of a size large enough to function as both 
an office and living space, the room appears to have been 
recently renovated. A door to the east leads out into the 
alehouse brewery.

shelving and the stone slab floor is stacked with rows of full 
and partly filled kegs, barrels and casks. A door set in the

wooden walls and polished hardwood floor. A furry, pale red 
woolen rug has been placed carefully before the small table in 
the center of the room, a spool and needle embroidered in silver 
thread upon it. The table is clearly not meant to be used for 
anything more than gatherings between small groups or waiting.

The Hall of Horticulturists~
   The hall is quite large, with a high ceiling and wide windows, 
but it seems almost crowded. Plants of every kind occupy baskets 
and pots throughout the room. A faint floral scent hangs in the 
air, mixing with other richer, more earthy smells. At one end of 
the room is the main entrance, above which hangs a painted canvas 
bearing the symbol for the Fellowship of Horticulturists. There 
is another door on the opposite wall, flanked on either side by 
two small ornate trees.

   The Headmaster's office is a small, cozy room with a brick 
fireplace and comfortable furnishings. Along one wall is a plush 
couch. A tidy desk, almost buried beneath the delicate, creeping 
tendrils of a potted vine, occupies a corner, along with an old 
wooden chair. Small plants sit in pots around the walls and on 
the mantle. A large bay window overlooks a private garden, and 
above the door a painted wooden plaque bears the symbol for the 
Fellowship of Horticulturists.

A Lush, White-Tiled Courtyard Before the Hall~
   Steel gates polished to a high, silvery sheen mark the 
boundary of this vast, impressive courtyard, their metal 
delicately wrought and inctricately detailed. The courtyard 
itself is a perfectly flat, green expanse, divided by a pattern 
of white-tiled pathways, immaculately kept. The paths are lined 
on either side by tall trees of lebethron, their fair boughs 
heavy with leaf, casting a myriad of shades in the light of day. 
The paths wind in a broad circle, joining at a point to the west, 
where they meet the white stone steps that lead into a massive 
Hall carved into the face of the mountain.

An Airy Entry Hall of White Stone~
   An expansive hall of awesome proportions rises here, divided 
by row upon row of fluted columns, each fashioned of cloudy white 
marble. The floor is set with black and white tile, the pattern 
twisting toward the hall's centre where the image of Gondor's 
White Tree, wrought in silver, is deeply engraved. Above, the 
ceiling arches into a broad dome, supported by many stone 
buttresses that recede from the apex, where a circle of clear 
glass scatters light about the enclosure. The hall thins to the 
north and south, where it branches off into two other 
passageways. A pair of heavy lebethron doors, painted black and 
crossed with heavy chains, leads eastward to a courtyard.

A Side Hall, Before the Council Chambers~
   Joined to the south with the dome of the Great Hall of Minas 
Tirith, the walls of this side hall bend sharply to the west, 
where they end at the facade of a pair of bolted black doors. In 
an arch above the doorway, engraved in silver, lies the image of 
a tall tower, surrounded by seven stars - the symbol of the 
Council of Minas Tirith. The hall here is brightly lit, the 
white tile brilliantly reflecting the rays of the sun during the 
day, and the warm glow of lamps burning here at night. The 
records rooms for the city are located directly north, while what 
appears to be an office is to the east behind solid doors.

deep alcoves along the hall, decorate the enclosure, set with 
plaques bearing the symbol of the Grandmaster of the Guilds of 
Minas Tirith. To the west lie double-doors of glossy black wood, 
the symbol of the Fellowship Committee - a chain of fifteen links 
circling a White Tree - set in silver into an arch above them. 
The side hall widens to the north where it joins with the hall of 
entry, clearly visible from this distance.

Within the Circular Council Chambers~
   Double doors of black wood open out onto a broad, circular 
chamber here, the walls of stone, washed a breathtaking white, 
curving in a gentle arch. The structure is reminiscient of an 
ampitheatre, and is divided into two, semi-circular halves. The 
western is dominated by a series of curving, white marble tables, 
each set with a number of chairs, and growing smaller in breadth 
as they approach the lower centre of the enclosure. The eastern 
half is adorned with many rows of white stone benches, designed 
to seat a significant number of spectators. At the very centre 
of the chamber is a tall podium, also fashioned of marble, that 
faces the western wall.

steps that lead down into it. The walls are set with a series of 
tall, thin panes of cloudy glass, barred with silver. Between 
each pane banners are hung, each sewn of fine fabric, and bearing 
the image of Gondor's White Tree. At the chamber's western end 
sits a massive table of smoky grey marble, flanked on two sides 
by seven chairs, a large, elaborate fifteenth seat positioned at 
its head. Benches of marble fill the rest of the space, bolted 
into the floor's white and black tile. A very large banner is 
displayed on the western wall, bearing the Committee's symbol.

about the enclosure, lit at night by the series of fine glass 
sconces that ring the Hall. On the western wall a banner hangs, 
sewn with the symbol of the Fellowship of Jewelers in gold

Fluted columns line the Hall's western and eastern sides, 
undecorated, but sturdy in construction. Along the walls, 
between the columns, weapons are crossed behind shields and hung 
on display. The swords and flails of glittering steel, spears of 
fine wood and sharp-edged knives are kept in pristine condition, 
and are well-lit by a series of elaborate bronze sconces 
positioned beside them. A small door in the western wall exits 
into a wing of the enclosure, while another, larger doorway leads 
out onto Rath Aldamir to the north.

wood follows the street as it progresses through the city, the 
second story shutters looking down onto the varied people that 
walk along Rath Sinth. Jutting west to east a short distance to 
the south is a branch of the gigantic Mount Mindolluin that the 
city of Minas Tirith is cut into, carving a way through the seven 
circles of the fair city.

here. To the southeast lie the Great Gates of Minas Tirith, 
while the large market known as the Plaza of the Sun continues 
both south and west. 
   To the north, an ample door permits the entrance to the 
Healer's Clinic of the First Circle. A small stall bearing the 
heraldry of Lord Eradan is set up in front of the clinic here.

In a Squat Wooden Shack~
   Windowless and constructed with varying types of wood, this
shack is thick-walled and sturdy. The walls themselves have had
boards nailed in random places and in different angles. When the
door is shut all the sounds outside become completely silenced,
blocked by the walls. In the western wall is a doorway, the only
entrance or exit for the shack. Along the doorway's frame, four
blocks have been set up, but for what purpose would require a
more extensive look. The ceiling has had thin boards of wood
laid atop the small rafters, and a single lantern hangs in the
middle of the shack. The floor is dirt, giving the small abode
a less-than-hospitable feeling.

   The blocks of wood are slightly rectangular and thick, with
two at the top of the door on either side and two blocks at the
bottom. The blocks each have a large metal rod inserted through
them, into the frame of the door. With a little effort, one can
twist the blocks into a position behind the edge of the door, or
turn them out of the way, most likely in an effort to strengthen
protection. With the four blocks turned behind the door, it
would become quite hard to break it down. The door is made of
different types of wood, just as the walls of the shack are.

singular lantern has been hung from the center of the room, to

   Anyone stepping into these wide, expansive gardens is
greeted by a manicured, carefully maintained path of 
round, soft pebbles, that snakes through a masterfully
arranged area, showing the skill of those who have 
designed and sculpted brush, tree and flower to
invigorate those who are visiting or staying at the 
magnificent building of the Houses of Healing. The path
leads into the marble front of the Houses, passing 
through benches and small, secluded and shady spots
were people rest or quietly speak, away from the
bustle of the city.

The Houses of Healing~
  This magnificent, tall hall is fashioned from the purest
white stones, fitted flawlessly. The floor is made of massive
slabs of white, veined marble, which sheens with a 
mirror-like quality. Light comes through thin, tall
windows, where thick panes of glass have been set,
sanded with diamond shapes, yielding a cold, clear
white light. Several fine glass lamps are set on the walls,
so this hall is always kept iluminated. A wide double 
door made of darkly-varnished lebethron allows exit
south to the expansive gardens and into the Sixth Circle.
To the west and east, doors made of the same 
darkly-varnished wood allow passage into the inner 
chambers of the Houses.

The entire shack has been constructed of simple oak wood. To the
west is set a door which leads outside. A small door set in the

dusty. Insects scratch and rattle all around, beetles and 
cockroaches skittering away from any light. The air is stale and

   Clearly unfinished, this chamber stretches out to a far wall 
of red brick. The northern wall boasts what once would have been 
impressive maple paneling, but is now little more than 
disintegrated remnants and collapsed brickwork. To the south, a 
vaulted doorway can be seen, the old hinges and frame rusty and 
rotting. The chamber's high ceiling seems to swallow the light. 
A scattering of glass fragments and shattered brass fittings 
hints at a shattered chandelier. All is old and stale. The 
pattering of rodents and the crawling of insects is all one can 
hear echoing through this damn, long-forgotten chamber.

While the western doorway is open, the eastern is blocked by a

moment.

A Square Chamber~
   Entering this room, a choking lack of air hits you. In this 
large chamber of rotting wood and ancient brickwork the remains 
of furniture have decomposed beyond individual recorgnition. 
Collapsed sections of ceiling hang precariously and the floor of 
wood panels is stained and cracked.

A Musty Bedroom~
   What was once a bedroom is covered in a thick layer of fine 
dust, accumulated over what must have been centuries. The 
furniture, though once fine, has long since fallen into 
disrepair, with splinters fraying from the wood and a broken leg 
cracking one bed.

leads downwards while a small ladder set in the corner of the

Inside a Small Barn~
   This well lit barn provides serveral stalls for horses and

a strong odor of musky wood, hay, manure, and various animals.
Hay and straw are littered about the first floor. A large pile
has been gathered in the far corner from the doors. A simple,
sturdy ladder leads up to a trap door into the floor above.

A Spacious Pillared Hall~
   Two rows of shield-engraved, highly-polished white pillars run 
down the length of this spacious hall. Large chequered marble 
tiles of silver-grey and black lend a cold beauty to the 
interior, which ends at an eastern-placed domed apse, flanked by 
high square windows containing painted panes depicting victory in 
battle and the symbol of a black shield before a silver-grey full 
moon. The simple coffered white roof lends support to three 
large ringed chandeliers, supported by thick silver-coated 
chains. Thick, arched oaken doors flank the hall before the apse 
on either side of a large, circular marble table decorated with 
diamond-shaped tiles of silver and black. Footsteps of the 
guards and busy clerks of this place echo as the come and go. A 
western doorway leads out into Rath Aldamir.

The Final Room~
   From here you can move around and find shops to equip yourself 
before you commence. You do not have to buy anything though. 
Your coin can be counted by standing still and typing "count". 
Look in any containers you are wearing to see what you already 
have. Type "inv" to see your current inventory and "score" to 
see how you are doing. If you want to know if you can use an 
item, preview it in the shop. Type "skills" to see what skills 
you have chosen. Unsure about a weapon skill? Type "help 
medium-edge" etc to see what it means. And if you preview a 
weapon it will tell you what type it is. 
   Once you have wandered around and you are happy to start, type 
#Benter game#0 to move directly to the Battered Shield backroom 
where you will find a board to read with job opportunities. The 
tavern is located at the southeast corner of the Sun Plaza in 
Minas Tirith. 
   If you are a villein you will start in Wardogs tavern in the 
Pelennor. If you have taken an army role you will start at Lord 
Eradan's fortress. And so on.

An Abandoned Building~
This small building appears to have been a person's dwelling
at one point, though it has long since been abandoned. The floors
are worn down to the dirt. The few windows throughout the place
are nothing more than empty gaps in the stone walls. A worn
and rickety set of stairs in the south-east corner leads up to
the roof, which has many holes and leaks.

  Recent activity can be found here, with a medley of footprints
and waste of foods spread throughout the floor.

simple hole, likely where a trapdoor used to be, leads down to a 
set of stairs in the building beneath.

from horses to chickens to cats and dogs, amble past the flames 
and underneath the half-dozen garishly-painted wagons that have 
been circled widely around the fire. In closer proximity to the 
flames are several seats, many of which are constantly occupied. 
   To the north, a massive blue-and-purple wagon has been parked, 
large enough to need to be drawn by a team of at least six 
horses. To the east, a much smaller vardo has been parked, a 
hazy and heady smoke continually pouring out of its open side 
door. Southward, a silver-and-red vardo lies.

Inside a Hazy, Dimly-Lit Vardo~
   With padded orange walls and cushions abounding on the floor, 
this wagon is, at least while stationary, a study in comfort and 
decadence. A heady smoke, that of Westmansweed, smokeleaf, and 
various other unidentifiable substances, clings to the ceiling 
and wafts out the single exit at all times. Incenses also burn 
on the table in the center, mingling and almost masking the other 
smells. A few scant candles and sconces light the wagon, 
providing an intimate, soft atmosphere, and it seems like there's 
always at least a few people in the back of the room taking 
advantage of this.

Stairwell before a Dungeon~

a wide landing. The lit gradually becomes dimmer as one steps
down the stairs. Torches set in the walls are the only source

which has cracked in some places as a testament of time. Near
the bottom of the stairs, the air becomes moist and stale.

A Dim Dungeon~
   Fairly deep underground, this small, stone room is cold, damp, 
and musty. A few torches set on the walls keep the room dimly 
lit. On each wall there is a sturdy oak door reinforced with
thick iron bands. The stone walls are old and cracked in many 
places, letting in groundwater here and there. Several cobwebs 
adorn the ceiling, many of which look like they have been there 
for years. Set in the northern wall is a broad archway, which 
leads to a wide stairwell.

A Corridor Leading to a Stone Chamber~
   An elegant and spacious corridor leads to this polished 
white-stone chamber. The corridor is lined with tapestries and 
gold filigree. The chamber, itself, has been left elegantly 
simplistic. Light source consists of plain lanterns screwed into 
brackets at head height on each of the three walls surrounding 
the door. One side of this chamber clearly serves as a 
comfortable office, with a desk, shelves and table. The other 
side has been set up as a quaint bedroom. The table in the 
middle of the room clearly marks the boundary of the two sides.

A Modest Living Room~
   This living room is of moderate size, allowing for a few 
pieces of furniture to be placed here and there. The walls have 
been painted a clean, off-white color though the floorboards are 
slightly-worn, hinting that this house is not new. A small, 
stone fireplace has been set in the eastern wall, providing 
warmth during the wintertime and amply illuminating the room when 
lit and two windows flank the entrance to this home, curtained by 
simple, ivory linens. A railed, wooden staircase has been built 
along one wall, leading upstairs with a glass lamp affixed along 
the wall to light the way. 
   A door set to the west leads back out onto the street and the 
door to the north leads into the kitchen.

A Small Tiled Kitchen~
   Worn grey, clay tiles spread across the floor of this small 
but cozy kitchen. The walls are white-washed with a squared 
archway cut into the southern wall, leading to the living room 
while at the western wall, a smallish door opens into the walk-in 
storage area. A narrow, wood-framed window has been set above a 
cast-iron stove in the corner of the room, the window itself too 
small to afford a look outside and only able to open so much as 
to allow a small breeze into the room while smooth flagstones 
form the base of a modest fireplace, preventing ash and woodchips 
from spilling out onto the floor from within it's hearth.

   Numerous wooden shelves line the walls of this closet while 
still leaving ample room to walk in and store extra items. The 
closet bears no windows, the only light available being the glass 
lamp suspended upon the wall to the side of the eastern doorway. 
This room seems older than the other rooms of the house and it's 
walls have been left unpainted, still the color of the original 
wood treatment.

A Small Dormitory~
   This small dormitory is just large enough to accomodate 
several bunk beds and a few storage bins. The cedar timber walls 
have been recently white-washed, helping to brighten the room and 
the floorboards are well worn from the passage of feet over the 
years. A small curtained window set in the northern wall allows 
light to shine through in the daytime while at night, a lamp set 
next to the southern door illuminates the room. A sturdy door 
set in the southern wall leads to a private bedchamber and a 
trapdoor in the corner leads down to the workroom.

A Modest Bedchamber~
   Spaciously set, this room has a comfortable feel to it, the 
sage green paint of the walls adding to its light distance apart, 
avoiding a cluttered atmosphere. It is not stuffy, with a large 
window and shutters overlooking the street below set in the 
southern wall. A lantern hangs here, providing light in the 
evening while a single, sturdy door of stained wood has been set 
in the northern wall, leading back out into the dormitory.

A Dingy Sitting Room~
   This small, cramped room is almost claustrophobic in feel with 
a low, sloping ceiling and off-white walls of flaking plaster. 
The ceiling leaks in a few places and a single, thin door bars 
the southern entry when closed. Placed beside the southern door 
is a tiny window and across the room is a small, stone fireplace 
set into the northern wall. Creaky, unpolished boards of 
rough-hewn planks serve this room as its floor with a threadbare 
rug spread across the floor. A low archway has been set in the 
eastern wall with a wrought-iron candleholder rivetted lopsidedly 
to the wall beside it.

A Tiny Bedroom~
   This dismally small room has a perpetually musty odor. The 
walls are covered with off-white plaster that perpetually chips 
and a low, sloping ceiling lends little towards comfort, isntead 
leaving just enough space for one or two smaller pieces of 
furniture. The walls are barren and windowless, markedly devoid 
of anything save a single, wrought-iron candleholder rivetted 
onto the lone curtained archway opening to a larger room to the 
west.

   Heavy, stone bricks line the walls of this rather large store 
room, their color a dark grey. Thick, oaken beams of wood 
support the ceiling overhead though here and there through the 
planks of wood, one can see up above the workroom. The room 
itself is rather large and spacious though it is unfurnished, 
even the floors made simply of packed dirt. A trapdoor in the 
far corner leads up to the workroom while a hook hanging from the 
wooden beam beside it offers a place where a lamp or lantern may 
hang.

   Wooden panels of a dark mahogany cover the walls from floor to 
ceiling, their surface bearing a glossy polish. The floor is of 
the same material though it is slightly worn and spread across 
the entire room is a rather plush, pine green rug. It is a 
rather spacious room, capable of bearing a few large pieces of 
furniture though it is only modestly furnished, lending it a 
rather roomy feeling. A curtained archway to the north leads 
into the kitchen beyond while the door set in the southern wall 
leads to the workroom and the one in the east wall leads back out 
to the shop front. A steep staircase against the far wall leads 
up to a doorway on the second floor of the building, the steps 
perpetually illuminated by the glass lamps that hang in a few 
places around the room.

A Large Forge~
   The walls and floor turn suddenly to stone here to prevent 
fire from spreading in case of an accident as a sweltering forge 
is set up here. Weapons in various stages of completion hang 
from the walls as well as various tools and raw implements. A 
large chimney made out of stone is on top of the ceiling to allow 
the smoke and heat to escape the wooden building while the heat 
emanating from the forge itself keeps the room in a constant, 
overbearing warmth. A door to the east leads to the storeroom 
while a large, iron-ring upon the floor allows the trapdoor to be 
opened or closed into the storage cellar beneath.

   Mahogany panels polished to a slight sheen cover the walls of 
this Master bedroom, lending it a rather opulent feel. The room 
is squarish in shep, spacious enough to accomodate a few pieces 
of large furniture in addition to the bed that dominates most of 
the southern wall. A thick, pine green rug spreads across the 
floor, plush and soft to the touch while a singular bay window 
set in the eastern wall to overlook the street outside has been 
covered by soft, ivory-colored linen curtains. A door to the 
west leads to the dormitory.

A Sheltered Side-Garden~
   Tucked along the side of a vine-covered manor, this area is 
secluded by the well-tended trees and the high whitewashed wall 
that runs around the estate, yet retains a sense of light and 
spaciousness due to its positioning and the rambling nature of 
the gardens here. The plantings of the herb gardens and the 
meticulous rows of various fruits and vegetables have been lined 
with pathways of white gravel, and small copper markers have been 
set in each section to identify the various plants grown within. 
A well-sheltered work area has been laid out against the wall of 
the manor with ivory tiles and equipped with a large potting 
bench and worktable, making it a most agreeable place in which to 
work.

A Newly Appointed Auction House~
   What was once a dusty, closed down antiques shop has been 
converted recently into a light and airy chamber, its walls 
oak-paneled and high ceiling painted with murals of famous heroes 
of Gondor and Stewards long-dead. The floor stretches to an 
eastern doorway through which clerks and well-dressed auctioneers 
come and go, carrying scrolls or presenting items on sale. A 
dark red thick carpet lends a comfortable feel to this quiet and 
respectable auction house. 
   At the far eastern end of the elegant chamber, furnished with 
plush chairs and couches, the auctioneer stands on a raised brass 
platform before an ornate silver-etched pedestal.

Before A House of Ill Repute~
   Merchant's Plaza is still visible from within this rather 
shaded alleyway, piles of trash visible, but pushed towards the 
edge of the area to lean against the walls of adjacent shanties 
and hovels. The house to the north of this small alley is 
somewhat unique, to the fact that it is much larger than the 
common shanty, even going so far has to have a rather dilapidated 
stoop. The house was, probably, white once upon a time but has 
faded into a dull, rather sickening, yellow with mildew and wet.

Entrance to the Halls of Segomo~
    This room is enormous, stretching southwards as a very long and
large hallway. A great host of many different shields and warbanners
adorn each side of the wall, put in places of honor. As you journey
down the hall it is clear that the inhabitants of this hallway are
all heroes of some kind or another. A great sense of reverence fills
you as these huge warriors, donning their bloodstained armor all
fill this hall. As each person passes they cross their weapons in
front of them and offer a slight bow of respect. Further down the
hall a bright light seems to glow, irradiating the area that is 
shrouded in an eerie mist. The beautiful white marble that makes up
this hall is engraved, baring scenes of great battles and stories
of sacrifice and honor. Large platters of meat and trays of mead
and dark-beer line the room, being carried by beautiful and
well-proportioned women. Large dining tables are also strewn about
bearing feasts of kingly proportions on them. A large fiery gate
is set into the northern slate of white marble, permitting some
to enter but none to exit.

Further down the Halls of Segomo~
   As you continue down the hallway, the great host of brave warriors
continues. Beautiful women still adorn the bright white marble hallways.
The great story of many battles is being recounted by many inhabitants
of the hall. The warbanners and great flags are only outdone by the 
great many weapons held high and put in places of reverence. Legendary
weapons such Aiglos and the Black Blade are hoisted high beside kingly
banners. The bright light to the south grows stronger as you move closer.
The fog covers the floor, moving about as the mighty warriors and heroes
continue about their daily business of drinking and feasting. Despite all
the different races in this hall and the seemingly insurmountable amount
of armor and weaponry, there are no harsh words to be heard and no sounds
of battle to reverbrate.

Nearing the end of the Halls of Segomo~
   The end of the Halls seems to be in sight, as the light that once
seemed to shine from afar is now blindingly close. The bright white marble
that creates the Hall only helps to intensify this light, making it
difficult to see. The usual crowd of warriors and heroes has now thinned,
as only the most renowned and brave are seen this far down the Hall. The 
walls on each side continue to depict battles, though the intensity of the
battles and the dramatic adaption of these battles have intensified at this 
point. Mythical creatures and weapons, the things of legends, seem to be
abundantly depicted. Whereas much clatter and storytelling was heard to the
south, silence prevails here. The light ahead seems to beckon the inhabitants
closer and yet few dare to progress any further. An aura of awe, respect and
admiration fills this area. The floor bears a large crest, inset with many
different colors and gems. The light seems to pierce through the fog and
illuminate these gems, allowing them to shine their color out onto the fog,
creating a truly marvelous display.

Throneroom of the Halls of Segomo~
  This is the end of the Halls of Segomo. It seems as all of the
grandeous halls have led to this very spot. The blinding light 
that has pelted the hallway has it's source here. The light, 
mysteriously, does not harm the vision in this room. The fog has 
nearly dissipated, allowing the beautiful floors and their 
engravings to be seen. Engraved into the floor is a profile of
all the mighty and most valiant warriors and heroes of this world.
The walls are clouded, as if made of clouds themselves, until about
halfway up where they once again become white marble, bearing 
on them weapons of the mighty immortals, Valar and Maiar alike.
A mighty crest inset with the words "AvenClash" hangs on the 
southern wall, though the crest is empty of the two mighty 
battle-swords that once resided within.

been spread across the worn floorboards, and a table has been set 
in the center of the room. The archway to the north has been 
covered by a simple, cream-colored linen curtain while a hallway 
leads further west into the building. A sturdy, wooden door to

   The whitewashed walls here are busy with shelves that contain 
a dizzying array of colorful threads and fabrics. A large 
workbench dominates one wall of the room while a bright blue rug 
has been scattered across the wood-planked worn floor. Fabrics 
are draped over wooden forms while some are heaped upon the 
worktable. A curtain to the south leads to the workroom and a 
locked doorway east leads to the storeroom. The sturdy ladder in 
the far corner of the room leads up to what seems to be a loft 
while past the open-air archway to the west, the kitchen can be 
seen.

   This room is rather small, allowing for only a few pieces of 
kitchen equipment and storage to be placed around the room as 
well as the table that has been pushed up against the corner of 
the room. This part of the building seems more worn than the

floor made of stones worn smooth. A window has been set upon the 
western wall while on the eastern, an open-air archway leads into 
the workshop. A curtain separates this kitchen from the hallway 
to the south.

A Cozy Office~
   This cozy office space is rather small and cramped, featuring 
a single window on the southern wall to allow in light. The 
walls are build of the same wood in the surrounding building, 
with a sturdy looking door fixed on the northern side, a shelf 
sturdily affixed to the wall beside it. Overall the place looks 
well maintained, and in neat order.

A Cluttered Storeroom~
   The walls here are white-washed to match the outside workroom. 
Sturdy, wooden racks have been affixed to the walls and numerous 
shelves have been built into the room itself, all bearing or 
carying numerous pieces of men's clothing of different colors, 
styles, and sizes. The entire room is rather cluttered even, 
barely enough room to hold its contents.

A Low-Ceilinged Loft~
   The ceiling hangs low here in the loft above the workshop, 
making it so that those that stand above average height would 
need to stoop somewhat, unable to stand up straight. Despite the 
short vertical height, the entire loft itself is rather moderate 
in size, allowing for a few beds and storage pieces to be placed 
here with ample room for folks to wander. The edge of the loft 
bears a wooden railing while the far end of the railing allows 
one to climb the ladder down to the workshop below.

Inside the Carriage~
   The inside of this carriage is luxurious and sumptuous, the 
upper-half of the walls heavily-padded with a diamond-pattern 
design of deep, azure heavy-weight silk with the lower half 
panelled in dark mahogany wood. It is clearly a vehicle meant 
for passengers as two benches, also padded in the same beautiful 
fabric, protrude from opposite walls of the carriage. The seats 
double as storage, the top lid opening up to reveal a spacious 
compartment inside, capable of holding a few pieces of luggage. 
The door to the carriage opens outwards, a tiny glass window 
covered with an ivory curtain set centered within it.

   This room is quite spacious and cozy, enough area here for a 
few pieces of furniture to be placed while still yet large enough 
for people to walk comfortably. A large, curtained window set in 
the western wall provides a lighting during the day and a breath 
of fresh air when opened. The walls have been painted a soothing 
shade of sage green and a multi-coloured woven rug covers the 
lightly stained, wood-planked floor. An oak-framed, floor-length 
mirror , graces the eastern wall and to the south, a doorway 
leads to the dormitory.

Amongst Fire-Ravanged Ruins~
   The gutted skeleton of a building remains here, the few 
remaining boards fire-blackened and burnt. The heavy smell of 
burning wood still pervades the area, as well as the sickening 
stench of something sweeter. The ground itself is a mass of 
charred wood and other debris--bits of twisted metal and ruined 
iron. The building to the north and south of this one are 
stained with ashes and scorched by the flames of whatever fire 
devoured so hungrily this building.

   This small room is decorated in an understated manner. The 
walls are painted a light beige with a darker umber trim. There 
are two small windows to one side of the room framed by simple, 
linen curtains drawn back on either side. The floor is covered 
by a thin, yet well cared for round brown rug. Though not overly

An Expansive Workroom~
   This room is rectangular in shape and made of smooth, wooden 
planks, the walls freshly-painted a sage green in color with oil 
lamps that have been strategically-placed around the room to keep 
it well-lit at all hours of the day and night. The room appears 
to have been given to practicality instead of appearance and 
decor as it is dominated instead by a large workbench and storage 
space from which can be seen a vast array of fabric bolts, dyes, 
and other tailoring supplies. A small door to the east leads 
into the storeroom while south brings one to the sitting room. 
Off to the west, one can head into the narrow hallway.

Before A Wide Engraved Portico Gate~
   The top of the steep tunnel emerges into the Second Circle 
Carak passage under Mindolluin. Careful and beautiful work 
produced a smooth and wide passageway here, leading off down 
towards the First Circle Sun Plaza. The sounds of running 
messengers is often heard, urgently going about their business. 
A large iron gate is able to bar entrance here, exquisitely 
engraved with the heraldic symbols of old Kings of Gondor, too 
ancient to have any Stewards honored here.

stone walls of this expansive hall, punctuated with the 
occasional angry shout or bout of raucous laughter. Shaded a 
stark grey, the walls enhance the military atmosphere that the 
well-kept floor and precisely arranged tables already create. 
Black and grey banners flutter to either side of every doorway, 
proudly displaying the sigil of Lord Eradan's Battalion. 
   A wide swinging door is set into the west wall, and a sturdy 
oaken door is set into the east wall. Along the north wall, a 
few steps lead into an enclosed staircase which ascends directly 
to the second floor, and centered in the southern wall, a wide 
arch allows glimpses of a large training hall.

clean. The same military precision extends to the arrangement of 
the cupboards, shelves, and pot-racks, everything having its 
place. The strong scent of spices, herbs, and cooking meats

from windows set high in the northern and western walls.

northward to more sparring and drill areas. 
   To the west, long and narrow glass-paned windows allow a view

A Long, High-Ceilinged Bunkroom~
   This spartan, stone-walled chamber is two stories high and 
occupies the southeast half of the entire building. Privacy is 
completely lacking here, and long rows of bunks are stacked high 
atop each other in practical, militaristic fashion. Pathways are 
kept clear of personal belongings, and the floor gleams with the 
attention of constant care. High above, fluttering near the

A Dim, Well-Organized Cellar~
   Some moss has managed to creep onto the steep stone steps that 
lead down from the trapdoor, despite the obvious efforts taken to 
keep this cellar clean. It extends deep into the earth and 
expands into the darkness, row after row of stout shelves 
containing casks and barrels of food and drink supply.

A Windowed Observation Chamber~
   This stone chamber resembles a balcony, as a huge glass window 
takes up nearly the entire length of the southern wall. Kept 
meticulously clean, it allows a good view of the drills and 
sparring sessions in the training hall below. A plain black wool 
carpet-runner stretches over the floor, leading up to a stout 
oaken doorway set in the western wall. Adorning the eastern wall 
is a large portrait, flanked by two lush, potted plants. 
Lanterns flank the arch in the northern wall, a steeply 
descending stairway visible beyond it.

ferny plants that appear to thrive off of the dim light available
in this chamber. They are obviously kept well-watered, as the
rich black soil they root in is always damp.

E
portrait~
   This detailed, oak-framed oil portrait, done on a life-sized
canvas, depicts a tall, grim-featured man, his close-cropped 
black hair flecked with grey. He has a fair complexion riddled 
with marks of war, a red scar adorning the right of his face from
ear to chin. His cloudy grey eyes lie beneath the hard ridge of
his brow, shadowed in their sockets, adding to the gravity of his
features. His elaborately chased black metal armor is partly
obscured by the draped folds of his cowled cloak, its deep hue
matching that of his armor. It is swept back over one shoulder
to fully reveal the detailed white tree emblazon painted onto
his plated cuirass, and one bony hand is curled about the hilt
of a greatsword strapped securely to his rigid back.

A Tidy Stone Bunkroom~
   Tapestries depicting glorified battle scenes drape over the 
pale grey stone walls of this chamber, and two large windows 
overlook the plaza in the north wall. The black-tiled floor 
bears a subtle mural in shades of grey, and the windows are 
flanked with dark drapes, adding an austere atmosphere to the 
room, despite its lack of true comfort. 
   An unobtrusive door of black-painted wood nestles in the 
southern wall, and a large oaken doorway breaks the 
tapestry-draped eastern wall.

A Spartan Stone-Walled Office~
   Built of blocks of square-cut stone, this stark grey-walled 
office makes up in space what it lacks in comfort. The floor is 
neatly laid black tile, kept so clean that it reflects the 
furniture and objects set atop it. A single, forlorn-looking 
potted plant rests on the sill of a window set in the west wall. 
   To the north, a black-painted door provides the only exit.

layer of dark, teak-wood panelling, a combination that keeps the 
area warm in the winter and cool in the summer. A deep, ocean 
blue carpet runs the length of the hallway, slightly-worn but 
still useable and the passage is well-lit by glass sconces 
mounted upon both walls at intervals.

   This modest, pleasant workroom has white stone walls and a 
tiled floor. Creating a colourful display, bundles of both fresh 
and dried flowers and herbs hang from the ceiling beams while 
several storage pieces are arranged along one wall with a long 
workbench. Rows of shelving hold the various tools and 
ingredients used in the owner's trade and in the west, a large 
window, set with paned glass, allows fresh light to stream in 
during the day. Two doors of sturdy teakwood are set in the 
northern and eastern walls.

   There is a vague hexagonal shape to this sitting room, giving 
it an elegant feel. It is modestly furnished, though tastefully 
so, a fine table set in the center and dominating the room though 
a few other furnishings decorate it, adding flair here and there. 
A wide, double arch leads west into the workroom while the faint 
smell of freshly-cooked food drifts in past the curtain of the 
curtained archway to the south. The door east leads back to the 
front of the shop and the northern door leads into a private 
chamber.

   This roomy workroom has plenty of space, with well-organized
furniture and storage. Upon first glance, the first impression is
that of a busy, meticulously kept area with plenty of room to work
in and move around in. Wood-panelled walls are visible behind the
various shelving units, with generously-sized windows to let in
the light. Doors head off to the north and south, with an archway
to the east leading to a sitting room.
   A staircase leads up to loft.

smooth from time. Despite the age of the room, the kitchen 
itself is tidy and immaculately clean. A series of shelves and 
racks line the walls, displaying some kitchen utensils while a 
thick linen drape of an undyed ivory color separates this room 
from the sitting room to the north.

grey, river-rock chimney that provides wintertime warmth. 
Stained a golden brown, the floor is made of planks of 
light-colored birch, sanded and stained a light golden brown.

made up of sturdy wooden planks which are in good condition, and 
the southern door has been painted with a decent coat of 
whitewash. This room is large enough to accomodate a desk and a 
few other small pieces of furniture but little else lest the room 
become cramped. A door in the east wall leads into a private

atmosphere. The sparse furniture of this room has been set a 
distance apart, avoiding a cluttered feel, and the light that 
streams through the broad bay window during the daytime adds to 
the comfortable and cozy atmosphere here. A lantern hangs from 
the room. providing light throughout the day as well as the 
faint smell of lamp oil. A single door of stained cedar wood has 
been set in the west wall and another in the southern wall leads 
out into the sitting room.

A Well-Appointed Sitting Room~
   This cozy sitting room is large enough to hold a desk, 
bookshelves and a few chairs. The walls have been painted a 
cheery shade of sunny yellow yet the light-grey stones of the 
floor show that the walls too, were masoned. The room is 
perpetually warm due to the existence of the large kitchens to 
the west beyond the archway but a bay window in the south wall 
allows a fresh breeze to waft in when opened. A sturdy door is 
set in the eastern wall right beneath a staircase that leads up 
to yet another door to the master's bedroom.

A Warm, Spacious Kitchen~
   This kitchen is very large and well-cared for. The entire 
room is made of light-grey stones, obviously to prevent a fire 
from catching and great care has been taken to push all things of 
wood away from the large pieces of equipment such as the 
fireplace or the stove and oven which dominate two entire walls 
of this kitchen. A small window set high in the western wall 
allows for fresh air to come and go though it is too small for 
any adult to fit within. 
   Despite any attempts to clean this kitchen, a fine layer of 
flour perpetually covers all things here.

warm enough to house quite a few people. Like the rest of the 
building, the entire room is made of light-grey stones, carefully 
fitted together. The room is lit by a few lanterns that have 
been hung upon the walls though the room's only other furnishings 
are only the bunks that line the walls.

safe from the outside weather. A small, squat window, covered

wall to allow light in, but to ensure that prying eyes cannot see 
in from outside. The floor has been sanded smooth and sealed 
against excess water.

no windows and has no decoration save the fresh coating of bright 
white paint upon the walls as do the other rooms of the house, 
its floors also wood-planked. A railed staircase leads down to 
the first floor, set in the far end of the hallway with a lamp 
set above the landing as well as a few paces down the hall, 
providing ample lighting.

The Fellowship Office~
   The floor and walls of this rather large office have been 
fashioned from white marble though the high, vaulted ceiling has 
been created with marble of a bluish-gray color, obvious care 
having gone into this building's architecture to create a light 
and airy atmosphere. The windows are unique in that they are 
placed at the top of the high walls and are iron-barred to 
prevent entry, a chain attached to the wooden shutters that cover 
them so that light can be let in during the daytime or so that 
the window can be closed during the evenings. Nearly every inch 
of the walls have been decorated by the various banners of the 
Fellowships, one for each of the fifteen, their bright colors and 
symbols proudly displayed. A few chairs have been placed here 
and there along the edges of the room and the only other piece of 
furniture is the large desk that has been set along the back 
wall. On the northern west corner of the room a rather grand and 
beautifully crafted staircase leads upstairs. It has been made 
of solid oak with beautiful, masterful carvings all along the 
rail.
