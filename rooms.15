The Entrance to the Hedge Maze~
   Tall hedges tower up around this area in the very corner of 
the maze. Covering the ground here is carefully tended, dark 
green grass, cut low to the ground. All around, flowers bloom 
profusely, and colorful ribbons have been tied in the bushes. 
Set around the area are many ornate stone benches. A break in 
the tall outer hedge lies to the south, leading out into Anorien, 
while to the north and west branch two paths that lead deeper 
into the hedge maze.

A Well-Lit Hallway, South of the Commons~
   Wooden panels make up the walls and floor of this long 
hallway, obviously well-kept as there is little dust or 
scuff-marks that can be seen. Glass lamps have been affixed 
equally-spaced along the walls to provide ample lighting for 
those that pass this way, set between the doors that are set to 
either side leading to private Fellow bedchambers. 
   The hustle and bustle of the Commons can be heard just to the 
north.

A Landing Above the Commons~
   Journeymen of all Fellowships head up and down the stairs into 
the commons here, moving to their bedchambers which line the 
halls that branch off in all directions from this landing. A 
single, silver-sconced lamp illuminates the area, showing off the 
rich mahogany color of the wood while the sounds of the common 
area can be heard drifting up from below.

UNUSED Terendil's Leathergoods~
   A narrow, neat shopfront invites customers mulling in from the 
busy marketplace. Rough, axe-hewn pine walls surround the dim 
display area, peeking upon the occupants with relentless woody 
eyes, while the small glassed windows in the western wall cast 
uncertain shadows on the tiny opposing door. Whenever the 
outside door closes, a small cloud of strong chemical smells 
wafts up from the various hides and leathergoods haphazardly 
displayed upon the walls and shelves.

Workroom~
   Lined on all six sides by dark-colored wooden panels, this 
room is remarkably spartan. The windows in the eastern wall have 
rough, semi-transparent glass panes while useful for letting in 
air or light, they are too small and close to the ceiling to 
allow a view of the outside. A large heavy wooden door leads to 
the shopfront to the west, and a flight of winding stairs in 
northeast corner may be used to ascend to the first floor. 
Beneath it, there is another smaller, less-noticiable trapdoor 
connecting to the cellar. The distinct smell of freshly tanned 
leather wafts up from the contents of the room.

Storage Cellar~
   While the ceiling of the cellar and the main structural 
support of the building above is built of heavy pine longs and 
planks, the entire foundation encapsulating this large room is 
composed of worn, heavy, white stone. The minor designs within 
some faces of the stone, as well as the time-worn smooth surfaces 
strongly suggest that the builders, the purpose, and even the age 
of the two parts of the building are drastically different. The 
floor is similarly composed of heavy, damp white stone, but there 
are small patches of what appear to be pieces of tile that had 
somehow not managed to get dislodged from the floor. Some faint, 
incomprehensible sigils appear in the eastern wall, just below 
where the stone has been broken off and replaced with the wooden 
construction. Set into the north wall is small door.

Airy Loft~
   Fitting into the triangle of the roof, this attic has been 
meticulously and neatly refitted into comfortable living 
quarters. A layer of straw insulation has been carefully secured 
with hides and heavy cloth into the parallel bars supporting the 
sloped roof. The latched vertical tile-glassed windows built 
into both sides of the roof let in adequate light during daytime, 
while additional dark-stained pine shutters can be closed to help 
provide additional heat during the winter. The walls are covered 
with dark-stained panels and into one corner a fireplace has been 
built. A sloped wooden door opens outward to the west, and a 
large trapdoor leads downstairs.

A Balcony Overlooking Rath Celerdain~
   Looking over the busy street below, this sturdy balcony serves 
as an outdoor recreational area and a place to enjoy the evening 
sun. A heavy collapsible canvas awning protects the loping door 
to the east from the rain, with several jutting wooden poles 
allowing the cloth roof to be further pulled out to encompass the 
entire balcony. To the west Mount Mindolluin and the rising 
upper circles of Minas Tirith can be seen.

A Spacious Reception Area~
   Entering this opulent foyer and reception area is like 
entering another world, even by Rath Siriondil standards. 
Inside, the air is slightly cooler than outside, and scented of 
fine resins and herbs. Thick, sturdy doors lead off in most 
directions, with the main one set just to the east leading back 
to the street. Floor lamps, each heavy-looking and baroquely 
carved in ancient designs, stand at regular intervals, 
illuminating a room that is already well-lit by windows set along 
the east wall. The white walls are hung with antique-looking 
tapestries embroidered in stirring Gondorian patriotic and 
historical designs, and a tawny-and-crimson rug covers most of 
the floor. Everything here reminds most visitors of calm, cool, 
rational businesslike efficiency.

lending some warmth to an otherwise spartan place. A large
hanging breaks up the monotony of the western wall, while 
a shelf is set in the north one, probably for storing the

   A spacious office, clearly that belonging to the person who
administers this building's enterprise, this opulent room houses
work-related furniture. Its entire feel is that of unhurried quality
and calm, businesslike efficiency. Nothing in it is out of place or
mussed up; nothing here is anything except clean and perfectly
organized. Its white-painted walls and pure white tiled floor are
set with hangings, ornamental armor and weapons, and a rich, deep-blue
rug that covers most of the floor. A pair of doors lead north and out
to the staircase.

   Very spacious, to the point of looking too large for the 
amount of furniture in it, this well-appointed room functions as 
a bedroom. Its walls are pure white, a very pale wood, and the 
floor is made of the same color tile, perfectly fitted and 
polished to a shine, though most of it is covered with a large, 
ornate floor rug made of rich, midnight blue wool and tassled in 
gold along its edges. Baroque-looking silver-chased brass hooks 
hold antique-looking oil lamps, and windows all along the north 
and eastern wall let in the light. Glass-paned doors to the east 
open onto a sumptuous balcony, while the other door opens to the 
south.

The Warehouse Depot~
   This warehouse stretches wide and tall from the entrance to the east. 
Well constructed, and newly built, the scent of wood and mortar 
pervades your nostrils. This part seems to be some sort of depot for 
whichever goods are brought in, by hand of wagon, which are then
piled or stored in the varied crates and wooden boxes set around, most
of them ordered neatly. Workhands seem to worry at the loading and
unloading of goods at most times, the large area lit by barred windows 
near the roof or by large lamps set in the walls.
This depot can be left by the wide, strong doors to the east or through
the large, banded-iron door to the north. An apparently thick wooden 
door leads south, after a small landing and a short flight of steps.

Inside a Large Warehouse~
   This is the northern end of a very large warehouse, newly-built
from the scent of wood and construction. It is utilitarian but
extremely well-constructed, with no flourishes or other decorative
touches but with all corners edged and mitered. Its ceiling is very
high overhead, and it is built with shelves all around at wide
intervals for holding large objects.

the day to keep the place in working order. The floor is made of stone, 
and the walls are strong masonry. A large skylight allows the sun to 
pour down clear illumination by day, while at night, two large oil 
lamps are lit, set in the walls. 
Doors lead to all directions here. North, back into the warehouse, 
while wooden ones lead east, west and south.

A Balcony Overlooking Rath Siriondil~
   This large, scenic, spacious crest juts out slightly above the 
expensive-looking homes of Rath Siriondil. Its balustrade is 
made of white stone, the same as that used for the walls, giving 
a clean, chiseled appearance. Each rail in the balustrade is 
carved in a scrolling, precise design, each with carved ivy and 
leaves that mix and mingle with the real ivy that grows all up 
along the wall and balcony. Lit by antique-looking oil lamps 
that give off a golden candlelight in the evenings, it has a 
sedate, calm, and studied feel evident only in the most opulent 
of gardens. The curve of the balcony's guard wall is carved as 
well, with each post topped with a carved shape -- a pyramid, 
then a globe, then a pyramid again, the three shapes set 
equidistant from each other. 
   Glass doors lead back into the bedroom.

leaving the exotic scents and sounds here to waft in and entice the
senses.

A Sumptuous Dining Area~
   This is a large, beautifully-appointed dining room, with its tile
floor and perfectly panelled walls. Deep blue wainscotting extends
halfway up to the panelling, about hip-height, and all the edges and
corners of each wall are set with deeply-mitered moulding and carved
gingerbreading. It is a dizzyingly opulent room, like all of the ones
in this building, with an air of quiet, serene, genteel nobility.
Its oil lamps look like they're hundreds of years old, and all hang 
from silver-chased brass hooks. Perfectly clean and organized, the
room is tasteful and carefully furnished.

into a much larger room while a short set of stairs leads
to another large and well reinforced door heading to the
reception area below. The same tawny and crimson rug from
the stairs spills up to cover the floors here as well, 
muffling your steps.

A Cool, Dug-out Cellar~
   Damp and cool, this cellar has barely enough room for an 
average person to stand upright. The walls are rough-hewn packed 
earth and rock, with numerous pale-white tree roots dangling from 
the west wall. The floor is hard-packed earth with the odd-cut 
ends of boards pieced together to make a serviceable floor to 
keep stored goods from being immediately ruined by the dampness.

The roof and walls are made of wooden panels, unfinished and 
dull. The floor is of stone. There is a chimney in the far 
northeast corner and several cabinets lining the wall. It seems 
entirely untouched by past ravages.

The City Gardens~
   The noisy hustle and bustle of the market, loud shouts of 
street-hawkers and haggling customers fade here in this lush and 
fragrant parkland. The area is enclosed by a tall, wrought iron 
fence to the west and the walls of several tall buildings to the 
north and south. The stone walls are softened by climbing ivy 
vines which sprawl across their rough surface. The foundation 
stones of an old building have been restacked to border 
ornamental flowerbeds which spill over with a riot of colors. A 
wide pathway lit with ornamented brass lanterns winds eastward 
through the manicured flowerbeds and some sitting benches, 
leading toward the far side of the gardens. To the south of the 
path stands a stone cairn flanked by rowan trees, a solitary 
lantern burning night and day above it.

The City Gardens~
   Enclosed on three sides by the walls of tall buildings 
situated to the north, east and south, this section of 
well-manicured gardens is peaceful and secluded. Ivy climbs the 
walls with a flourish of verdent green, looking as though the 
gardens wish to escape into the city. Occasional windows look 
out into the park, the lights flickering as people move about 
inside. A wide pathway wends its way through neatly manicured 
bushes and wide beds of inviting grasses and wildflowers, leading 
westward toward a distant gate. A manicured sitting area is in 
the northeast corner, where granite benches are flanked by clumps 
of blooming violets, the area lit with a soothing glow by ornate 
brass lanterns on tall poles. 
   A small wooden garden shed sits in the northeast corner,
behind some tall bushes that flower in the warmer months.

A Second-Storey Room With Shattered Roof~
   The decaying and abused walls of this upper level room are 
cracked and broken in places, as the entire roof appears to have 
been knocked off some time ago, a segment still hanging from the 
northern wall. The worn floorboards squeak worryingly if anyone 
walks here. A sturdy door, set in the southern wall, leads out 
onto a narrow balcony. However, while the doorway remains 
intact, the wall on either side has toppled to the ground. A 
creaky wooden staircase leads down to the first floor of the old 
building.

inside, just like the outside, is all made of well polished white 
oak, carved and embellished with silver filigree. The floor is 
set with a roughly woven mat to absorb water and give traction in 
the oft-wet weather of the region. The doors on either side are 
set with heavy velvet curtains of ocean blue and tassled 
tie-backs so one can enjoy the day or block out the rain as 
desired. All in all it is a very clean, very comfortable coach, 
the decorations all in white, silver and ocean blue.

scattered squares of lush grass, this courtyard has been set with 
a repeating pattern of grey stone tiles, their surfaces worn 
smooth by years of weather. Rows of poplars and spruce further 
divide the courtyard into columns, the main tile-set path leading 
straight southward to the front of a sprawling estate, climbing 
upward to end at the bulk of an engraved ebonwood door. The low 
facade of the estate is fashioned of grey-pebbled sandstone, the 
slatted roof sporting rectangles of red clay. A collapsed white 
tower can be seen looming over the southeastern section of the 
building, at the edge of the Anduin to the east.

strange black wood panels of the hall's floor. Windows of etched 
glass scatter shafts of light between the columns in the daytime, 
while elaborate lanterns of twisting bronze keep the hall 
well-lit at night. Drapes of green silk hug the ends of the 
spotless panes, complimented by the rich azure and burgundy of 
the many heavy tapestries that hang like sentries on the western 
and eastern walls of the enclosure, depicting scenes of battle 
and many solemn faces. One large tapestry hangs above a 
double-door to the south, proudly displaying the image of a blue, 
spread-winged falcon over a many-speared red sun. Two other 
doors lead away from the hall, while the northern door exits out 
onto a grey-tiled courtyard.

the occasional tapestry, hang from the sandstone walls, and the 
room is sparsely dotted with furniture, lending it an open but

Wide Smooth Section of Roof~
   Somehow, while all around is a view of a collapsed structure 
of limestone, granite, marble and iron, here an entire segment of 
sloping roof remains, rising up westwards. The view of eastern 
Osgiliath is spectacular and leads swiftly eastwards as far as 
the Black Mountains of the Ephel Duath and the Morgul Vale 
somewhere beyond the Forests of the Moon. The view to the north 
is of Ithilien and the thick sparkling band of the Anduin during 
daylight hours. Westwards the section ends suddenly and is 
broken into smaller pieces, leading to a fatal drop below of many 
floors, although some platforms and remains cn be seen stretching 
far above the Anduin resting on old pillars. 
   An easy climb down from here is offered at the south-eastern 
corner, where the roof has shifted outwards until it nearly 
touches a rooftop amidst the carnage of old Osgiliath. 
Southwards, a missing wall grants access to a small section of 
the remains of the Great Dome's eastern fortress.

West Annex of A Spacious Armoury~
   The first thing that one notices in this room is the near
overpowering smell of oil. Hardened leather suits of armour rest
on racks bear the aroma, blades of all sorts lay wrapped in oil
soaked rags as do the array of mail suits displayed along the
rear wall. Spacious and well ordered, the armoury bears enough
arms and armour to outfit an army. Pike and halberds lay leaned
against tall racks that in turn bear axes and maces, everything
kept in impeccable condition. A small, shielded lantern casts a
slight light onto the room.

A Shattered Chamber~
   Remnants of weapons racks rot here amidst the limestone blocks 
and sections of ceiling that crush pike shafts and picked-clean 
skeletons of humanoids still clutching rusted halberks and 
wearing blemished yrcish armor. It seems from the number of 
remains that a large section of the Great Dome's east side 
collapsed suddenly here, burying those looting this chamber. An 
open doorway opens northwards with a breeze felt from beyond. A 
small gap to the west offers access to an intact doorway. 
Southwards is further ruin and wreckage.

An Exposed Floor Above Ruins~
   Walking through the doorway from the eastern chamber, it is 
quickly noticed that only a few feet remain of the floor of 
whatever chamber this used to be. Shorn off and laying somewhere 
beneath here, the entire section of the roof, floor and walls are 
gone. Looking down, a view of boulders, rubble and remains is 
all that is offered. To the west is a view of a series of 
columns, some broken, some leaning against each other. Resting 
atop some are the remains of the Great Dome roof as it narrowed 
and stretched across the Bel-Iant bridge over the Anduin, nearly 
a mile to the western shore beyond. Rushing water can be heard 
far below along with the macabre sight of the river flowing above 
what was once the greatest bridge over the Anduin.

A Ruined Armory With A Hole~
   An old reek of oil lingers among the wrecked chamber, filled 
with rubble and the press of shattered helms and mail suits. 
Nothing here is recoverable, being too long exposed to the 
elements from the large hole in the northern half of the 
destroyed building. Stepping over chunks of basalt as well as 
barely recognisable burnt remains, access to the only exit at 
ground level from this room is reached southwards. Rainwater 
pools under the shattered ceiling space and rats scurry through 
cracks and under piles of ruined remnants of Osgiliath's proud 
past.

A Small, Cozy Kitchen~
   This room is brightly lit by lamps on the walls, giving it a 
warm feeling. It is arranged in such a manner as to be 
confining, but not quite cramped. Various smells permeate the 
air at almost any hour of the day, as it seems to be used as a 
kitchen area. Where they show amidst the furnishings, the floor 
and walls are faded wood, marred in many places with scuffs and 
scratches. A door in the northern wall leads to the staircase 
which links the other floors of the building.

A Grey-Tiled Courtyard~
   Bordered by what seems to have at one time been an elaborate 
gate, now a rusty chunk of immovable metal barring the way, this 
courtyard has seen better days. Repeating patterns of grey stone 
tiles, their surfaces worn smooth by years of weather, lay 
cracked upon the ground. Rows of skeletal trees, their claw-like 
branches rising without hope of salvation, further divide the 
courtyard into columns, the main tile-set path leading straight 
southwards to the front of a desolate estate. Its windows 
boarded up, glass shattered upon the ground, walls pitted, it 
seems a mockery of its former splendor. The low facade of the 
estate is fashioned of grey-pebbled sandstone, the slatted roof 
sporting rectangles of red clay, some of these fallen to the 
ground or simply missing.

An Abandoned Hall Lined With Faded Tapestries~
   A wide hall stretches forward here, its domed roof, gaps in 
its surface allowing the sky to be shown, supporting by two rows 
of cracked sandstone columns. The black wood panels of the 
hall's floor seem to have suffered under the neglecting hand of 
abandon, dust accumulating and rot having begun to set in. 
Windows, some of their etched glass panes still visible, are 
boarded up firmly in a vain attempt to provide more security. 
Elaborate lanterns of twisting bronze hang upon the walls, their 
existence supported but their function destroyed. Drapes of 
green silk, moth-eaten, hug the ends of the windows, complimented 
in a rather mocking way by the heavy tapestries colored in azure 
and burgundy which hang like sentries on the western and eastern 
walls of the enclosure, depicting scenes of battle and many 
solemn faces. These tapestries seem uncared for however have 
deteriorated little. One large tapestry hangs high upon the 
southern wall, depicting in a decrepit manner a blue, 
spread-winged falcon over a many-speared red sun. A single door 
leads to the west. 
   The doors to the north and west were once sturdy and strong,
but now hang in splinters and shards and are broken.

A Dusty Lounge~
   A burgundy-painted pinewood door, the color flaking in places 
to reveal the surface beneath, opens out onto this spacious, 
stone-walled room. The floor, fashioned of ebonwood panels with 
twisting, inky grain, seems dusty and dirty, though little else 
save perhaps vermin have harmed it. The wall bends north to west 
to south, forming a crescent whose length is set with several 
wide, boarded windows. Paintings, age and rats having reached 
them in the form of holes and yellowing, accompanied by the 
occasional tapestry in fairer condition, hang from the sandstone 
walls, and the room is sparsely dotted with old, moldy furniture 
lending it a rather desolate, abandoned atmosphere. A fireplace 
is set into the southern wing of the flat western wall, its ashes 
an unusually large mound.

At the Bow of the Intrepid~
   The ship ends at a dull point here, and a short mast rises 
from the bow. A triangular foresail is attached, complete with a 
boom and rig. Numerous ropes and line are coiled on the mast in 
neat rigs, and the fullsail blasts full whenever the wind picks 
up.

At the Midsection of the Intrepid~
   Twelve men could easily stand shoulder-to-shoulder here on the 
main deck of the ship. The worn wooden panels underfoot are held 
secure by rusty nails that keep them firmly down. The main sail 
flutters overhead, the mast directly in the middle of the deck. 
A door is set fore in the sterncastle, ladders flanking it on 
either side which lead up to the aft deck, and sturdy-yet-old 
wooden rails flank the sides of the boat. The ship creaks a bit 
as it bobs in the water. A small crew of sailors busily move 
about the deck, checking rigs and performing other tasks.

Climbing the Mast~
   A single rope ladder climbs up the main mast of the ship, 
leading eventually to the crows nest high above. Surrounding it 
are all sorts of rigging equipment, from ropes to chains. The 
mast is very thick, and tends to sway every time the large 
triangular sail catches wind. The rope ladder continues as it 
climbs the mast, with footholds sunken into the wood in even 
intervals.

In a Small Crow's Nest~
   The main mast narrows slightly, barely supporting the weight 
of the circular platform perch near its top. Well above it, 
there's room for the ship's flag to fly, with a flag-rope 
connected to a swivel at the very top of the mast beneath a 
finial. The platform itself is made of sturdy treated 
greyish-brown wood, roughened by sea air and water, and it's not 
entirely snug against wind. It'd reach about waist-height to 
most people, with a ledge all around it to lean on if desired. 
It rocks and heaves with every motion of the ship below, but 
despite the instability it affords a spectacular view of the 
surrounding area and of the deck that looks entirely too far 
down. A rope ladder leads down the mast, with patina'd bronze 
footholds sunk into the wood at regular intervals.

well as a few pieces of furniture if needed.

This room holds an impressive nature, it's width equal to that 
of the ship. Along the edges of the wooden ceiling lie simply 
engraved edgings that lead to wooden walls. The floorboards and 
walls of the cabin are made from thick pieces of wood that have 
been heavily caulked and sealed. Among the many scents that 
intermingle here, the smell of Westmansweed and wood are the 
prominent ones, seeming to mix into a rather pleasant odor. 
   On the floor lies a large, rounded plush blue carpet, scarlet 
intigrated into it in a simple bulls-eye design.

A Cellar~
   A narrow stone staircase sits in a corner of this small 
cellar, and the walls and floor are made of rough irregular 
stones. Light is visible in between the planks that make up the 
ceiling, and there are several large beams that span across it, 
as well as two thick wooden pillars.

Brenna's Threads (S)~
   This square-shaped shopfront continues from the north,
an archway dividing the two parts of it. A wooden floor is
set about with rugs, making shopping the racks and shelves
a comfortable experience on the feet. A large window to
the east looks out at the street.

A Well-Lit Hallway, West of the Commons~
   Wooden panels make up the walls and floor of this long 
hallway, obviously well-kept as there is little dust or 
scuff-marks that can be seen. Glass lamps have been affixed 
equally-spaced along the walls to provide ample lighting for 
those that pass this way, set between the doors that are set to 
either side leading to private Fellow bedchambers. 
   The hustle and bustle of the Commons can be heard just to the 
east.

The Burnt-Out Ruins of a Warehouse~
   What was once a warehouse is now a charred and thoroughly 
destroyed assortment of ash and rubble. Although more or less 
everything has been destroyed beyond recognition, some of the 
larger sections of masonry that were stored here have managed to 
survive with salvageable levels of damage. There is no longer a 
roof, and the weather is free to enter the remains of this 
building.

The Burnt-Out Ruins of a Warehouse with a Collapsed Roof~
   What was once a warehouse is now a charred and thoroughly

half-charred and smashed machinery gives any indication of what 
this place was once used for. There is no longer a roof, and the 
weather is free to enter the remains of this building.

A Small Galley~
   This expansive galley, where the crew's food is prepared, is 
well kept and orderly. Smelling pleasantly of food at all times 
of the day and attains a welcoming atmosphere. The walls and 
floor are made of tightly caulked wood, and the whole room sways 
back and forth with the rocking of the ship.

A Cargo Hold Turned Sleeping Quarters~
   Tightly fit planks, caulked and sealed, make up the floor and 
walls of this room. The looser planks above and the regular 
supports spaced through the room imply that the room was 
originally designed as a cargo hold, but has been efficiently 
altered to make it simple sleeping quarters for several 
individuals. The ever- present creek of wood on wood is about 
the only sound that generally makes its way into this otherwise 
quiet room and its original design as a hold makes it wider than 
you would expect of a sleeping berth.

The Charred Remnants of a Building~
   A pile of burnt timbers and broken rubble lies strewn across 
the ground. It is barely possible to determine the shape of the 
original building that once stood here. The intensity of the 
fire that swept through its interior has left only the outer 
stone walls standing. The thick stone walls are scarred and 
blackened by soot and ash, leaving them a mucky grey colour.

A Makeshift Forge~
   The original use of this place, probably a shop, is now lost to
the setting of a makeshift forge. Half the northern wall is taken
by a freshly built chimney, that houses a forge of massive size,
yet of simple craftmanship. The walls lack any finishing, and
are of simple stone, bearing the marks of whichever covering
they had prior to being abandoned. The floor, of stone, has
nothing to conceal the cold, harsh nature of granite, and 
bears many scuff marks, globs of molten metal and chips.
The heat is constant and tiring, as the forge is always alight,
as men seem to keep it fed and blowing with infernal rage,
constantly shaping weapons at a fast pace. A simple door
leads outside, to the more bearable outside air.

stones.  A shuttered window rests within the eastern wall, 
offering a vantage point over the ruined city and even reveals 
the edge of Ithilien.  A fireplace made of stone is set within 
the northern wall, giving a warm glow that fills the room with 
a soft light.

This window lies within the eastern wall of the stone room, 
offering a distant view of the broken city of Osgiliath.  Beyond
the crumbled ruins of the walls of Osgiliath can be seen the 
Forest of Ithilien.  The woodland looks at peace as it lies in 
the far distance of sight.

A Branch in the Hedge Maze~
   The tall, dark-green shrubs that make up this maze loom up 
over the grassy path. Though not huge, the path here is sizable, 
large enough for three people to walk abreast. The hedge here 
grows thickly, so dense that it cannot be seen through. This way 
intersects another path, creating three exits. 
   The paths lead east south and west.

A Dead End in the Maze~
   Neatly groomed dark-green hedges rise up on either side of the 
sparse grassy path of this maze. Wide enough for three people to 
walk side by side the path continues on, bordered by the lush, 
dense vegetation of the maze walls. 
   The path leads straight into a wall of hedges here, the only 
exit leading back west.

A T-Shaped Intersection in the Maze~
   Healthy shrubs, their leaves a dark green in color, rise up in 
neatly-trimmed hedges on either side of the maze. Lush grass has 
been cut short, providing a path through the maze that is wide 
enough for three people to walk side by side as the path 
continues on. Many brightly-colored ribbons have been tied onto 
various branches of the hedge, adding cheerful splashes of color 
here and there. 
   The path here leads north, south, and east towards another 
three-way intersection in the maze.

A Spacious Workshop~
   This wide and spacious woodworking shop is two stories high, 
with thick oaken beams drawn laterally across the space. During 
the day, columns of dust-illuminated sunlight fall from open 
skylights upon the ample work area, brightening it fully. A few 
rooms on the second storey overlook the shop floor, each with 
glass-paned windows facing out from high above. Dangling from 
the rafters are a set of oil lanterns on blackened iron chains. 
In the front of the workshop, a neatly trimmed staircase traces 
up the wall, making its way to the second level.

A Hallway Above the Shop Floor~
   This sparsely appointed hallway runs the length of the shop, 
leading from a stairway at one end to a distant window set at its 
furthest length. Its floor is lined with neatly trimmed 
fittings, all set above the beautifully joined maple floorboards. 
A lamp fixture of curling black iron sits at eye level on one 
wall.

   Bunkbeds line one wall of this dorm room, butting up against 
the neatly-trimmed paneled walls. Maple-wood flooring runs the 
length of the dorm, the wood smooth with years of foot traffic 
and care. On the opposite side of the dorm lay a dramatic set of 
shelves, their extent lining high up into the rafters. A window 
on the wall opposite the door looks out onto the shopfloor.

A Refurbished Kitchen~
   Recently renovated, the focal point of this kitchen is an old 
but well-maintained cast-iron stove that dominates one corner of 
the room. A set of tastefully trimmed fine maple-wood cabinets 
line the walls, providing for ample storage. The scent of spices 
and herbs filters through the air, borne along by the louvered 
vents above the windows. A thin burgundy coloured linen drape 
covers the exit of the kitchen, separating it from the sounds of 
the workshop beyond.

   This intimate addition to the shop is nicely furnished, it's 
wide maple floorboards waxed and polished to a warm hue. In the 
corner of the room stands a proud granite stonework fireplace, a 
thick, carved wooden mantle seamlessly mounted to its face. A 
fogged-glass bay window sits amid floor-to-ceiling maple-wood 
shelving, offering bright but filtered light throughout the room 
during daytime.

A Storage Room for Lumber and Supplies~
   Inset from the main workshop and tucked underneath a set of 
stairs rising up to the second level, this storage area for 
lumber is scantly illuminated. The sharp and rich aromas of many 
different kinds of wood and lumber fills the air and a light 
layer of dust covers over the worn maple-wood flooring. A large 
rack for lumber lines one wall with rails for large pieces 
setting atop slotted shelving for smaller pieces. A single wall 
sconce hangs from the thick timber of the support beam for the 
staircase.

Atop a Tower's Wooden Platform~
   Fashioned of sturdy pine planks, this tower rises on stout
log legs off to the west side of the opening in the ruined city
walls. It offers a commanding view of the area outside of the 
breach in the wall. The platform itself is surrounded by a low
wooden railing, and is crowned by a slatted roof of wooden 
shingles that provide shelter from the elements. A square hole has
been cut in the center of the platform's floor with a wooden ladder
hinged to one of the edges, providing access to the ground below.

Light Woodlands Near Ruined Walls~
   Some animals can be seen passing through this area, though they
are shy and avoid contact with any who are near. Tree shadows fall
over almost everything, though none block the sky fully as the area
is only lightly wooded. The ground is littered with dead leaves that
have decayed over time leaving the soil mostly moist with small shrubs
growing everywhere. To the south, the ruined gray walls of a city
rise, a gaping hole revealing a path into the city. Sharpened log
palisades have been built on each side of the path.

Street Running By Flattened Buildings~
   The building to the west seem literally flattened. Supports,
roofs, walls all have collapsed inwards, the top of this mess of
debris pitted and scarred with old, broken arrows, large rocks
and soot-streaked logs. It spills into the street, rendering the
street slimmer than it once was, the grey cobblestones beneath
only visible at intervals, churned dirt and mud in their place.
A smell of cold ash wafts through here, lending the area even
more of a dismal, forgotten atmosphere. A wall, pitted and scarred
rises to the east, the foundations of an older wall crumbled at 
its base. A small wooden sign bearing a horse is splayed atop one
of the ruined buildings.

   A wall of rope bound logs are set to the north, a wooden gate
hung in the mid-section of the wall. There are wooden steps leading
up to an archers platform on the eastern end of the wall.

A Rubble-Strewn Street~
   Lampposts, set at random intervals, run north and south here,
rather large gaps in between each occupied with twisted, stricken
heaps of metal which may at one time been copies of their still
standing brethren. The lanterns have all long expired, some
with shattered panes and others with twisted bodies. Heading 
parallel to the lanterns is a large, confused jumble of rubble,
only a few buildings peeking their grimy walls through. Those 
few buildings visible are mostly one-story, made of grayish brown
stone, though the couple of two-story buildings who have survived
hold wooden walls, the paint long chipped with only remnants 
remaining. A pitted and scarred wall rises opposite these.

   Sharpened log palisades have been built to the south, a short 
wall of rope lashed logs set behind them. A wooden gate reaches 
across the path.

A Damp Cellar~
   Though set high above the river to escape the worst of any

heavily-scented with rot and mould. Overpowering this though is 
the stench of charred flesh and bones. Dark patches bear tribute 
to the feats of those who triumphed here long ago and disposed of 
so many hundreds of citizens who once called this city their 
home. 
   A vertical ladder offers escape to the hovel above.

A Steep Dug Out Tunnel~
   Under crumbling blocks of Dome roofing, iron sections of wall 
supports, great pillars propping up the mass of twisted girding 
and masonry, this tunnel descends from the east to the west. It 
is a long and expansive passageway, strewn with bones and old 
rusting equipment and armor of many past battles.

A Bone Stairwell~
   A rising stairwell of bones, skulls and little more, wraps 
around a desecrated pillar where once the faces of Kings were 
carved. Now they are formless faces, the features chiseled or 
torn away. This stairwell winds up to a small opening and down 
to a large chamber.

The Edge Of A Large Collapse On the Great Dome~
   Looking down from here the street below can be seen. To the 
north a burnt out tower lays charred and dulled. To the south 
the ruins of the Dome rise up blocking access. Eastwards a hole 
can be seen in the rubble, leading out of sight, though the roof 
collapse rises just beyond.

A Large Master Bedroom~
   Lovingly crafted with flawless maple boards, the floors of 
this bedroom are polished and sealed by a careful hand. The 
walls, wooden as well, are covered in grand carvings and 
etchings. Scenes depicting the White Tree, and often times 
groups of soldiers gathered about are carefully engraved into the 
main portions of the walls. The ceiling itself has been married 
perfectly with the walls, the smooth boards beautifully engraved 
with one great, massive image of the White Tree. 


   The door to the west is made from solid oak, with engraved 
sigils about it.

A Broad Causeway~
   Relatively recent construction has extended this causeway as 
it leads eastward toward a pair of branching towers jutting up 
from a broad ancient city wall. They bracket an enormous 
portcullis and gate. The road has been constructed of large well 
hewn granite slabs which have been expertly lain. The cobbles 
have been lain in an alternating pattern of black and white 
checkerboard.
