a roughly-sketched map on plain parchment~
A roughly-sketched map on plain parchment has been discarded here.~
[This map has been roughly but meticulously sketched in charcoal     
 pencil. The shapes are simple and not always in strict  
 proportion, probably due to a lack of ability on the part of the
 cartographer. The notations, however, show great skill and are
 scribed in the Westron tongue, using Numenian-Tengwar sigils.]

an unframed pen-and-ink drawing~
An unframed pen-and-ink drawing on a sheet of parchment lies here.~
   An artistic, black line-drawing of a male figure resting in a 
supine position on a large stone slab covers the surface of this 
sheet of parchment. Great care and attention to detail has been 
given to the rendering of the angular facial features and the 
individual locks of short, curly hair covering the head of this 
middle-aged man. His overall expression is slightly macabre 
suggesting he may have met an unpleasant and untimely end. His 
lifeless eyes are wide open, staring blankly at the viewer; his 
lips are twisted into a pained grimace. The body itself is 
unclothed save for a burial shroud that has been modestly draped 
over the lower half of the corpse. Fine cross-hatching has been 
used to effectively portray the play of light and shadow over the 
figure and the stone slab upon which it rests.

A grim, pen-and-ink drawing on an unframed parchment lies here.~
   Rendered artfully across this page is a black line-drawing 
portraying the severed head of a man. Great attention to detail 
has been given to the depiction of his hair and facial features, 
which are twisted and permanently frozen in a gruesome expression 
of pain. His expressionless eyes stare blankly back at the 
viewer. A long, pointed pike resting beside the severed head 
adds to the grim tone of this sketch. A burial shroud has been 
artfully draped over the stone slab, upon which the menacing pike 
and severed head sit. Loose cross-hatching has been used to 
suggest the play of light and shadow across the stone slab and 
the macabre arrangement.

Angry and frightened commoners have gathered in a crowd here.~
   A large group of commoners, both men and women, adults and 
children, have gathered in to a circular crowd here, voicing 
their concerns and fears, looking uneasily towards the east and 
west. Everyone carries large rucksacks upon their backs, 
bristling with all manner of goods, and periodically some of the 
group break off to walk down the besieged streets of Osgiliath. 
Many hungry and desperate faces can be seen.

induce a weeping effect that is intensified when coupled with the 
strong scent produced when the onions are peeled or sliced.

Traces of gold leaf can still be found on the spine, but time has 
long since made whatever title may have been on the book 
illegible. A pair of brass hinges are set into the cover of the 
book and can be used to latch it shut. Once shiny and bright, 
the hinges are now heavily-scratched and dull, but still 
functional.

A wide sculpture of polished marble depicting a battle is on display here.~
   Made with the greatest of care and skill, this marble 
sculpture is very large, near a dozen strides in each direction. 
It holds nearly a dozen figures, the majority of them clearly 
recognisable as soliders of Gondor. Each man has been etched 
with its own character, one made to be a elderly veteran with a 
grizzled face and notched armor, another looks to be no older 
than twenty winters with a smooth youthful visage. The are all 
stood at various points, one holding the banner of Gondor, 
another with a sword raised to strike, a third running through a 
twisted, horrible twisted creature. The rest are similiarly 
posed, all of them stand in strong positions, proud and firm, 
save one. A lone man hangs limp held, aloft by a soldier at 
either side, his armor bears many rents and cuts, each one 
painstakingly etched in to the mail of his armor. Around them 
their brothers in arms hold back twisted creatures in ragged 
clothes, each one baring a snarling grimmace, though each one 
having been beaten back. Each of the figures is near-life sized 
and no detail has been spared in their making, from the rings of 
their mail to the notches on their blade.

A drying plant with heart-shaped leaves and elegant flowers is hung here.~
   This small plant has leafy flowering stems and long-stalked, 
heart-shaped leaves. It is carefully drying to preseve the 
elegant flowers, each with five petals and a paler spur, a hint 
of the original violet hue remaining. Unlike its cousin, the 
sweet violet, the dog violet emits little odor; even less now 
that it is hanging to dry.

A drying plant with globular flower-heads the color of dried blood hangs here.~
   The stems of this dried plant are upright and hairless, the 
leaves composed of paired rows of leaflets. The distinctive 
flower-heads that grown on the apices of the stems have been 
carefully dried with the rest of the plant to preserve the once 
crimson color; now the hue of dried blood. Painstaking care was 
taken in the drying of this Great Burnet plant, evidenced by the 
preservation.

A slimy, sticky, reeking glob of ooze is spread out here.~
   This greenish-yellow glob of ooze sticks to anything it 
touches, though it feels slippery at the same time. It is quite 
ripe, smelling much like a pile of rotten fruit and vegetables 
after being in the sun. The smell seems to linger in the 
nostrils.
