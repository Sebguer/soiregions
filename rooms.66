Marketplace at the Entrance to the Warrens~
   The steep slopes of a black mountain rise up quickly to the 
south, the rocky surface clearly unscalable. Instead, numerous 
tunnels look to have been carved out of the rock, leading down in 
to the dark warrens that run below Tur Edendor. Several burly 
orcs work underneath a tarpaulin during the day and out in the 
open during the night, always sweating as they quarry the black 
rock which is then taken down to the numerous stalls where all 
manner of ore and stone is sold. The range of peaks curves to 
the west as well, but the market continues north and east. There 
is a metal pole with red and white stripes over the door of the 
shop to the south.

A Bleak Entrance to the Markets, East of the Gatehouse~
   A large, bowl-shaped plateau stretches out to the north, east 
and south from beyond the squat stone gatehouse nestled between 
two stubby spires of rock to the west. A worn mountain wall of 
bleak, black rock forms the horizon to all points of the compass, 
however the northern slope is broken in to several stretches of 
ramshackle tents and huts, and a particularly foreboding jagged 
peak in the east rises ominously high above. The air is alive 
with sounds as a lively farmers market takes place in the 
plateau. 
   From the glum and foreboding gatehouse have been thrust black 
Flags, on them crossed lightning bolts encircled by a halo, 
embroidered boldly with bronze stitching.

Noisy Punishment Round before a Large Black Canvas Tent~
   A squat stone building is obscured to the west where a large 
black canvas tent has been fastened to its coarse stone walls - 
spanning the gap between two dull peaks of the mountains that 
form the outer border of Tur Edendor, the structure begins here 
and continues to run southward. Smooth pavers of stone have been 
laid out in a semi-circle originating from a doorway set in the 
building, and the press of common-folk of the city is absent 
here; the sight of gallows, cages, spiked heads, whipping posts, 
and the occasional crest-helmed soldier dragging a bloodied 
unfortunate in to the gaolhouse is enough to generate appropriate 
disinterest amongst the citizenry. Of course, on occasions a 
small crowd of people can be seen, cheering on as various 
miscreants are hanged, flogged, or beaten in full view to the 
accompaniment of an official proclamation of their misdeeds. 
   The ominous presence of an obsidian structure, looming high 
above the western battlements, dominates the area here.

Cliff-Edged Corner of the Plateau, Before a Popular Tavern~
   The weather-worn mountains that enclose the township of Tur 
Edendor rise up to the west and north here, though a series of 
shanties, tents and the occasional established house have been 
erected upon the latter slope. Before the steep rise of the 
black cliffs, though, is a superbly constructed building. A 
polished bronze sign creaks gently above the narrow door of the 
building, a picture that looks faintly like a bed engraved 
carefully upon it. More recently, a wooden shop has been 
constructed to the west, built at a slight lean to take into 
account the mountain's slope as it rises.

Southern Edge of the Market Square~
   This edge of the market-square is occupied by a significantly 
rougher number of people, never more than a dozen gathered here 
at once, but those that are seem to be all scar-skinned, 
weapon-bearing orcs, goblins or men, both pale-skinned and 
dark-skinned, and clad in heavy, smelly leathers. The focus of 
their attention is a line of squat, dark tents that have been 
erected along the steep face of the black rocks that end the 
market-square to the south, all manner of rusted, stinking, 
bloody, and otherwise almost worthless pieces of armour for sale 
to those warriors, mercenaries, bandits and other scum unable to 
afford anything of greater quality. A stone building leans up 
against the southside of the square. It's portal is swept clean 
and debris free.

Wagon-Traversed Section of the Market~
   The sight of a wooden, produce-filled wagon wheeling along the 
dirt-covered rocky round of Tur Edendor's market is a common one 
here, all manner of goods brought to and from the city; caged 
pigs squeal and caged chickens squawk, gangly peasant boys sit 
atop sacks of ground wheat destined for the baking ovens, and 
some carts bear silent, straight-backed Black Watch soldiers upon 
them. Around the wagons, numerous other rural-looking people 
walk, some with bundles tied on their backs, other stopping here 
to hawk whatever they may have for sale.

Amidst Rows of Vegetables and Fruits for Sale ~
   Perhaps a dozen farmers have gathered here, forming a series 
of narrow paths and channels through the otherwise broad market 
with their large stalls of fruits and vegetables for sales, each 
taking up quite an amount of room and staffed by skinny-looking 
peasants. Lettuces, carrots, cabbages, apples, oranges... all 
manner of goods are for sale here, but most seem to be of 
inferior quality, bearing signs of rot, frost damage or 
infestation. A number of people looking to be household 
servants, their demure manner and slave-collars telling signs, 
filter through the area, buying from the various vendors.

South of a Shanty-Filled Ledge in the Market~
   There is little activity in the market here, shadowed by a 
jutting ledge of rock to the north. Upon it, and the whole 
northern side of the ring of peaks that encircle Tur Edendor, a 
number of crude shanties and shacks have been hastily assembled, 
looking to sway slightly in the cold, brisk breeze that is always 
present up here in the mountains. A number of humans, clad in 
rags and sackcloth, can be seen to meander between the dark 
houses on the plateau, some making their way down the narrow 
trail directly north of here, steep steps carved out of the black 
rock and winding their way about a fissure in the peak.

Tinker-Filled Section of the Market North of the Pits~
   The clang and clash of metal upon metal fills the Market 
Square here, drowning out the common noises of chatter and 
footstep. A number of grindstones, mounted on the end of rickety 
push-carts, spin here, tended to by wizened orcs and burly men, 
brutish warriors and mercenaries standing about waiting for their 
favourite blade to be sharpened. Other stalls here sell and 
trade in all manner of weapons, though most that pass hands look 
to be old, rusted, or simply broken. The market expands to the 
north, east and west, and a large pit has been dug out of the 
mountain to the north, a wooden stockade complete with seats and 
stalls constructed above it.

Market Section Occupied by Trappers, Tanners and Hunters~
   Furs and pelts change hands between farmers, skinners, 
trappers and tanners in this section of the marketplace, tents 
and stalls being erected, manned, and then dismantled for the day 
or night. A multitude of stenches, all clear and sharp and harsh 
upon the nose, prevail here, generated from the stomach wrenching 
processes of tanning carried out in large clay basins set on the 
dirt-covered ground. The piles of bone, brains and other scraps 
and miscellaneous animal pieces that quickly form up are carted 
away regularly by filthy mongrels, all bearing rags wrapped about 
their face to combat the smell.

Centre of the Marketplace, Marked by an Imposing Copper Statue~
   The copper statue that rises up tall here is surrounded by a 
small section of well-laid pavers, no merchants or hawkers 
boasting about their wares in the immediate vicinity of the 
figure, the crest-helmed soldiers that patrol the farmer's market 
in force clearing away the occasional one that tries. Roughly 
the centre of the bowl-shaped depression in the mountains, this 
area gives a broad view of the rim of black rock that encloses 
Tur Edendor, the shanties erected on the northern slope, and the 
keep being carved out of a dire eastward peak.

Amongst Livestock Being Auctioned in the Market~
   Farmers walk through their cows, horses, donkeys, mules, 
sheep, chickens and pigs for sale here in the marketplace, most 
looking far from the peak of health, but still able to work on a 
farm. Occasionally a scarred goblin or orc wrangler can be seen 
dragging a warg, wolf or bloated, freakishly large spider for 
sale here, but apart from the curious gazes these creatures 
attract, the leather-covered warriors passing by pay little 
attention as livestock changes hands between the farming folk. 
Not too far away, great hunks of raw meat are for display and 
sale from a number of human-run stalls.

Open-Aired Lumber Yard in the Market~
   Numerous fences formed from hemp rope tied between stout posts 
partition this section of the market, circled around numerous 
bulks of lumber or raw tree logs, a gathering of spry and nimble 
goblins clambering over them and keeping a watchful eyes for any 
thieves desperate enough to steal dozens of pounds of wood. The 
occasional pair of rugged lumberjacks, usually dragging a 
coniferous tree with them that leaves a trail of shed needles, 
enters from the northwest, engaging in a brisk trade in the 
lumber market before departing again.

Outside a Large, Blockish Building in the Market Square~
   Purveyors of small handicrafts set up their stalls and tents 
here, hawking handmade goods including wooden jewelry, combs, 
penny-whistles, dolls, balls, shelves, bowls, cups, utensils and 
numerous other petty goods. The hawkers come and go often 
enough, carting their ratty stalls and burlap sacking with them, 
but more people always come to replace them, the land beneath a 
particularly sheer and large rise of black stone to the east 
seemingly the hawking grounds of the town. A few wooden 
buildings have been built between the Market Square and the steep 
slope, one of them particularly big, almost a warehouse in size.

   Stalls and stands, carts and tents all compete for space here 
amongst the clamor of the Market Square. The area is almost 
constantly a bustle of activity, merchants and vendors selling 
items of every description to customers of equal variety. This 
portion of the market is at the eastern edge, the bowl-shaped 
depression in the mountain rimmed by black stone that rises 
sharply to the east in an imposing incline. To the other 
directions the market continues, and a large bronze statue can be 
seen rising above the crowds to the west.

Edge of the Market Square, Leading up the Mountain~
   The shallow-bowl-shaped Market Square extends to the south and 
west from this rocky patch of ground, ringed all around by the 
black mountains of Tur Edendor. To the east, a path has been 
carved in the stone ground, shallow steps leading up to a plateau 
populated by buildings, most fashioned out of wood but some 
looking to be carved directly out of the mountain. A variety of 
people move along the steps deeper in to the market, the majority 
commoners of the city heading down to purchase the day's 
supplies, others carrying bundles of goods or produce to sell. A 
strudy wooden ramp of logs leads up a red-stripped tent on the 
plateau.

A Gatehouse Between the Marketplace and the Orkish Underwarrens~
   As the Orkish warrens begin to slope upwards, towards the 
surface of Tur Edendor, a heavily fortified gatehouse of stone 
and iron has been created - seemingly focused on controlling the 
flow of traffic in to the marketplace more than out. There are 
two layers of stone barriers, the first lower than the second, 
which have been reinforced with wrought iron bars. A heavy 
bronze gate - too heavy to be opened by a single individual - 
separates the market from the warrens. Black Watchmen inspect 
and search individuals at random, creating a bottleneck and 
letting them through in groups once inspected. Nonetheless the 
traffic is fairly light, as the Orks seek to stay underground 
during the light of day.

Black-Watchman shout instructions over the din and cry, splitting 
the orkish folk into manageable groups which are promptly 
searched and sent through. The occasional brawl or fight breaks 
out when one is turned back, and these individuals are generally 
quickly subdued by the Black Watch and create delays for the 
rest.

Warren Path Twisting North and East Before a Shop Stocked with Armours~
   The further one moves to the east, the warmer and staler the 
air grows, save for the occasional gust of chill wind that comes 
from the north. For those unable to see easily in the dark, such 
as the occasional pair of humans or Black Watch soldier that walk 
through this turning warren path, each orkish dwelling here bears 
a lit lamp out front, casting the immediate area in a dull glow 
of light and disappearing in the distance north and east as 
little points of yellow. The ceiling is high ahead, the walls 
and ground hacked out in a regular, relatively straight fashion.

Underground Intersection of Paths Near a Busy Weaponshop~
A broad, well cut tunnel path runs from east to west, but a 
smaller, crooked and darker path leads off to the south, the 
hunched shapes of orcs and goblins visible moving up and down it. 
The heavy stench of sweat fills the stuffy underground here, and 
constant gruntings, mutterings, bellows and raspings of humanoid 
voices echoes off the dark stone walls. Many smaller paths, only 
a few steps long, lead to solid wooden doors, decorated with 
bones from various animals, housing perhaps of some of the orcs 
that move east, west and south along the paths.

To the north are two large, wooden double doors that lead into
what appears to be a shop selling tools and weapons. A number
of men and women can be seen walking in and out at all times,
races varying widely.

Lamp-Lit Tunnels Passing by an Yrcish Kennels~
   Amidst the crowds of runty orcs and goblins that trudge from 
east to west through the tunnel, a number of large, long-haired 
wargs pad by, slightly edgy amongst this many people but all of 
the beasts held tightly by their owners. Two elaborate totems 
each bearing a complete warg skeleton held together by string and 
wood are set either side of a broad cavern opening to the north, 
rough barkings and deep growls often audible from the kennels. 
From high ceiling of this straight-cut a number of small metal 
lamps swing, occasionally being tended to by small goblins 
clambrering up the walls, serving to light the area for the 
occasional human seen down in the tunnels.

goblins descend from the north to make their way deeper westward 
in to the warrens, and at dusk the event is repeated the opposite 
way. The floor is slightly sloped, only just noticably so, and 
is relatively smooth and free from obstacles, though a few large 
black rocks intermixed with a few greyish boulders occupies the 
south-eastern corner of the warrens, where the tunnel takes a 
slight turn from north to west.

A Gatehouse between the Marketplace and the Orkish Underwarrens ~
   As the Orkish warrens begin to slope upwards, towards the 
surface of Tur Edendor, a heavily fortified gatehouse of stone 
and iron has been created - seemingly focused on controlling the 
flow of traffic in to the marketplace more than out. There are 
two layers of stone barriers, the first lower than the second, 
which have been reinforced with wrought iron bars. A heavy 
bronze gate - too heavy to be opened by a single individual - 
separates the market from the warrens. Black Watchmen inspect 
and search individuals at random, creating a bottleneck and 
letting them through in groups once inspected. Nonetheless the 
traffic is fairly light, as the Orks seek to stay underground 
during the light of day.

bronze gate - too heavy to be opened by a single individual - 
separates the market from the warrens. Many black-blooded folk 
clamour to leave the underwarrens, slightly overwhelmed 
Black-Watchman shout instructions over the din and cry, splitting 
the orkish folk into manageable groups which are promptly 
searched and sent through. The occasional brawl or fight breaks 
out when one is turned back, and these individuals are generally 
quickly subdued by the Black Watch and create delays for the 
rest.

Twisted, Irregular Cavern Passage~
   Jagged stone floors slope here, sharply in places and almost 
flat in others. The corridor runs in a roughly spiral fashion, 
appearing to be partially natural and partially dug from the 
rock. A harsh breeze whips about, headed from above and blowing 
bits of dust and other particles around. The area is completely 
unlit, making footing treacherous for those who are unaware. The 
tunnel leads both upwards and eastwards. 
   A jagged rock porch sits off one side of the musty corridor, 
opening onto cave doors.

Open-Topped Intersection of Passages~
   The rock ceiling of the warrens is gone here, replaced instead 
by a wide gash in the mountainside, allowing cool, fresh air to 
billow down from the hole and spread throughout the tunnels. A 
crescent of sunlight cuts down through the dark of the tunnel on 
occasion, whenever this occurs the brutish orcs and crafy goblins 
that move through the intersection of passages veer away from the 
patch. Irregular, crooked passages lead off from this circular 
cavern to the north and west, whilst a wider, more regular tunnel 
spans eastward.

Outside the Fighting Pits~
   The underwarrens of Tur Edendor expand in size here, this end 
looking large enough to hold many a dozen a humanoid, the growth 
looking to be a natural cave, stalagmites and stalactites 
reaching down and up if a small open reach of space to the north. 
The western cave wall is barred by a large gate fashioned of 
crude logs lashed together, the wood splashed with gore and 
decorates with bones, and a smaller, yet still broad door is set 
midway down the wooden structure, a large rock acting as a 
stepping stone up to it.

Bone-Decorated Warrens~
   All manner of cheerful, yet somewhat macabre to the human eye, 
totems, figures and installations of bone line the northern and 
southern edges of this broad tunnel that runs through the 
underwarrens of Tur Edendor. Some of the bone structures still 
bear fur and hides of the animal upon them, others polished to a 
bony shine in the dim lamp light, each of the totems set before 
the tent and door entrances to orkish dwellings here. A crowd of 
orcs and goblins move from east to west along the tunnel, some 
occasionally ducking south to a dead end in the cave complex.

Breezy yet Stuffy-Aired Tunnel~
   The air trapped between the dark rock walls, ceilings and 
floor of this tunnel is stuffy and stagnant to the nose, yet it 
moves in a light breeze nonetheless. Fouler, warmer air rises 
from a large, troll-sized chute set in the middle of the warren 
path here, accompanied by the occasional distorted echo of 
screams and grunts. The trail of orcs and goblins that plod from 
north to west moves to avoid this downwards trail leading even 
deeper in to the underbelly of the settlement, and even the 
crest-helmed Black Watch soldiers that patrol through here do not 
bother to venture down there.

Dead End Cave Before a Network of Cavern Doors and Tents~
   A short, crooked path runs from the north to end here in a 
somewhat large, sphere shaped cavern, two tiers of rock paths 
winding their way about the egg-shaped hollow and leading past 
all manner of stout doors and scrap-cloth tents that lead deeper 
in to private dwellings. Swarming about the paths are orcs of 
all shapes and sizes, some definitely of the female persuasion by 
the gaggle of tiny orkish babes they carry about with them, orcs 
and goblins busy themselves with every day chores, beating furs 
and skinning carcasses and weaving clothing from their coarse 
hair. The air is filled with the rough, rumbling chatter of orcs 
and high-pitched squeakings of the goblins that dwell here.

Warren Passage Shifting South and East~
   The warrens that lead beneath Tur Edendor shift from the south 
to the east here, the walls looking to have been dug perhaps by 
some of the multitude of orcs and goblins that press through the 
area. Humans too can be seen walking on by, usually in groups of 
two or three, save for the lone Black Watch soldiers, all of 
these people walking beneath the small lamps that hang from the 
high ceiling. In the north-west corner, streams of filthy, 
waste-tainted water stream down from holes in rock, pooling in a 
circle of stones before eventually draining down away a tiny 
chute in the centre of the pool.

Open-Aired Section of the Tunnels~
   The normal stagnant air of the warrens here is fresh and brisk 
instead, the winds that buffet the black peaks of the Ephel Duath 
visible through a large, jagged hole in the ceiling filtering 
down past craggy rocks to here, along with bright beams of 
sunlight during the day. A rich crop of mushrooms grows about 
the gap in the ceiling, and goblins can be seen climbing from 
rock to rock to pick them before passing them down to other orkin 
that live in the bone-decorated caverns. The tunnels continue 
north to an intersection, and west to another jagged bend.

Intersection of Cavern Paths~
   Three tunnel paths that lead past a multitude of orc and 
goblin hovels and shanties merge here in a spacious square, 
cluttered with all manner of small business. Bags of insects, 
frogs, and spiders are traded between wiry goblins, bones and 
furs haggled over between beefy orcs, and games of bootskull 
played between roaming bands of orkish youth. Moving through 
this commotion are broader labourers, as well as the few humans 
that have business down here in the Orkish warrens. The paths 
lead north to an exit from the tunnels, east to a darker trail, 
and south to a fresh-aired portion of the caves.

Underwarrens Below the Martial Yards~
   A long, broad and regularly-carved slope leads from the north, 
running down to the south, from the bustling martial yards of Tur 
Edendor to an intersection in the Orkish warrens. The trail 
passes by a number of small, crooked passages that run only a 
short distance from the main run to stout doors that mark the 
entrances of private caves and warrens for orcs and goblins. 
Totems constructed of hair-lashed bone mark the entrances of each 
of these tunnels, some currently being tended and extended by 
orcs and goblins with bags of bones and hair at their feet.

Sooty-Aired Cavern Above a Downward Slope~
   Not only is the air here foul and stagnant to the nose, but 
also rather warm, the breath and bodyheat of the rag-clad orcs 
and goblins that shuffle past trapped between the immutable stone 
ceiling, floor and walls. This section of the orkish warrens 
leads from the north to the south in a series of jagged bends and 
twists, large spires of rock crowding the middle of the path, 
having simply been dug about. The tunnel ends at a steep slope 
that leads further down in to stiffling, uncomfortable air, the 
row of lamps that hang from the ceiling ending above it.

Tunnel Path Running From North to South~
   From north to south this tunnel path runs, parallel to a chute 
of foul sewage cut in to the eastern wall, a number of narrow 
holes cut above it feeding it with more waste and cleaner water 
and sending the thick fludge slowly flowing southward to 
disappear down a sinkhole. While the eastern side of the tunnel 
are not inhabited, the western side has been colonised by a 
number of orkish and goblin families, setting up rough, 
leatherskin tents and wooden doors before hand-dug hollows in the 
rock walls of the underwarrens.

Lamp Lit Twist in the Warrens~
   The warrens twist from west to south here, from fresher air to 
air more foul, and from cheerier settings to darker. Rough, 
brutish orcs lumber past, most clad only in a loincloth of rags, 
identifiable as Edendorian labourers by their bulge and poverty. 
A few rough campfires burn stringy meat in small, family-occupied 
hollows off the main path, filling the air with a greasy haze of 
smoke. The uneven rock floor is covered in slippery moss in some 
places, drips of water falling on to these areas of stone from 
the ceiling, next to which lamps hang suspended.

A Jagged, Spiralling Stone Corridor~
   Jagged stone floors slope here, sharply in places and almost 
flat in others. The corridor runs in a roughly spiral fashion, 
appearing to be partially natural and partially dug from the 
rock. A harsh breeze whips about, headed from above and blowing 
bits of dust and other particles around. The area is completely 
unlit, making footing treacherous for those who are unaware. The 
tunnel leads both upwards and eastwards.

A Windy Tunnel With Uneven, Shelved Floors~
   This wide, natural tunnel has been worked by tools recently to 
make it more hospitable to foot travel, but even so, it remains 
difficult to traverse. The floor is broken and uneven, shelves 
of rock terraced over one another. There are occasionally stone 
blocks or wooden steps and ladders set up to allow easier 
movement. A fairly strong breeze blows constantly through the 
tunnel, flowing from the west toward the south. The tunnel also 
continues to the east, where it appears to widen further.

A Low, Broad Cavern Bordered by Warren Holes~
   The tunnels widen here, forming a broad cavern intersected 
only by a few rough pillars. The edge of the area is lined with 
holes, burrows, and tentlike shanties, and the area is almost 
constantly bustling with some sort of activity. The smell in 
here is noxious, a bouquet of stenches arising from each hovel 
and nest that is dug here. Trash strewn in every nook and cranny 
adds to this unpleasant atmosphere, and the floor is slick with 
grease and slime of unnamable composition. The only exit from 
this cavern lies to the west, where the low moan of moving air 
can be heard.

A Sloped, Breezy Underground Passage~
   Sloped stone floors and roughly cut walls make up this 
passageway, which is cut into solid rock. The air is constantly 
moving, a ragged breeze rushing past at almost all times. Warm 
and dark, a variety of foul smells can be caught by the nose, 
some of which no doubt issue from the slow trickle of raw sewage 
that runs along a shallow trench at the side of the passage and, 
at times, slops into the tunnel to make footing slick. The 
passageway continues to the north, and slopes downward to the 
south.

   This rough intersection of tunnels looks haphazard at best, a 
sudden and unplanned meeting of natural and artificially made 
passages. The air is breezy and hot, flowing constantly from 
north to west with a low moaning sound. A barely tolerable 
stench emanates from what looks to be a side passage to the east, 
which angles slickly downward into the darkness along with a flow 
of sewage running through a shallow trench.

A Sloping Cavern of Stinking Muck~
   A slow, but steady trickle of filth and sewage rolls into this 
cavern, both from the west and from several grated holes in the 
walls and ceiling. It collects in a cesspool at the bottom of 
the sloped floor, unbelievable in its odor and wretched in 
appearance. Flies buzz constantly over the bubbling muck, their 
population visible as an ever-churning cloud in the oppressive 
air. Where the floor slopes to the east, a large grate has been 
set into the wall to allow some of the filth to escape its 
imprisonment here. The cavern slopes upward to the west, where 
there is some slight relief from the horrible smell.

A Narrow, Twisting Tunnel~
   Narrow and twisting, one can barely see along this tunnel as 
it winds through the solid stone of the mountains. Spaced 
unevenly along its length are a series of dark burrows, probably 
dwellings of those who inhabit these depths. The air here is in 
constant motion, moaning its way from the east to the south, and 
filled with a choking stench that seems to find a new and 
uniquely vile flavor every several moments. The floor slants 
upward to the south, and the tunnel widens and becomes more even 
to the east.

A Hazy, Soot-Choked Passageway~
   A hole leading off the side of this passageway is apparently 
home to some smelting or forging operation, as hot smoke and soot 
billows forth in occasional puffs from within. This does very 
little good for the air here, which is already uncomfortably warm 
and strangely still. Now and then, however, a noticable pressure 
difference is created as the smoke is sucked toward the east, 
where an almost constant, dull moan of moving air is heard. In 
this direction, the walls and floor seem to take on a more 
natural appearance, as opposed to the south, where the marks of 
tools can be seen in the stone.

   Roughly hacked stone walls, pitted and lined with warrens, run 
along this tunnel. The air is heavy with the smells of 
habitation, most of which are foul enough to choke the lungs. 
The floor is pebbly and rough, and sounds occasionally echo 
through the area from distant fights, squabbles, or other unknown 
happenings. The darkness is heavy here as the tunnel leads north

A Stuffy, Curving Tunnel Branching Off to the South~
   A wavering curve marks the path of this tunnel, the walls 
zagging this way and that as they lead through solid stone. 
Along the way, they open at points into small caves and burrows, 
from which issue forth rancid smells that taint the already heavy 
air. The scent of sulfur mixes into this heavy odor, creating a 
very stuffy atmosphere. The floor is mostly even, however, and 
seems to become much more so as the tunnel leads to the south. 
To the east and west, the passage is much rougher. A large, 
bulging mount of rock has a narrow, rickety wooden staircase 
leading up to it, the stone walls painted with crude faces.

A Broad Section of Hot, Dark Tunnel~
   This underground tunnel has been cut out of solid rock, the 
walls dripping with moisture. It is broad, with plenty of room 
for passers-by, but there is no lighting here and the air is 
stifling. The scent of sulfur is heavy, and a faint haze makes 
breathing difficult. The tunnel leads in a straight line from 
north to south.

A Small, Filthy Cave-Market Before an Orkish Tavern~
   The atmosphere in this cavern is cluttered, filthy, and loud. 
Decrepit shanties, stalls, tents, and structures line every 
available wall and pillar. Some are abandoned, but many house 
merchants, tinkers, or repairmen of varying description. Little 
of value seems present here, however, most services aimed at the 
meager needs of those who dwell in these dark pits. Perched on a 
shelf of stone at the end of the cave stands a haphazard wooden 
building, its eastern door thrown wide open and looking to be a 
tavern of some sorts.

A Sharp, Angular, Underground Turn North of an Orkish Tavern~
   This wide tunnel makes a very sharp turn here, the stone walls 
ending abruptly at a ragged section of wall to the south and 
continuing on eastward. At several points on the rough section 
of wall issue forth steam. These hot, sulfurous fumes leak 
slowly out, filling the air with a heavy and stifling scent. A 
haze hangs over the area, particularly the floor, where a layer 
of foggy wisps collect. To the south, the entranceway to a 
tavern fashioned out of a wooden shack built on top of the cave 
walls is wide open, dim lit coming from within.

A Low, Stifling Tunnel~
   Heavy with fumes and smoke, this tunnel is cut into solid 
stone. Various dim warren-holes and burrows line the walls, 
covered mostly by thin wooden doors or mangy curtains. The 
ceiling in the area is low, barely five feet in height, and no 
lights are present. The footing is rather treacherous in any 
case, as a thin haze of smoke curls as it settles amidst the 
craggy rock.

A Fume-Choked Tunnel Intersection~
   The sound of water is heard faintly here, the source a trickle 
of filthy water that runs down the corner of the intersection and 
vanishes into a narrow crack in the floor. Visibility is poor, 
sulfurous fumes mixing with sooty smoke to create a miasma of 
barely-breathable air. There is little of interest here 
otherwise, save the continuance of passageways that lead west, 
east, and south.

A Curved, Dingy Stone Passage~
   This passage curves, the soot-blackened walls fading in dingy 
darkness to the eye. Some care has been taken to level the 
floor, and the walls are cut from stone and smoothed, although 
the marks of tools become more evident as the tunnel curves to 
the east. A few low holes have been dug into the side of the 
passage, no doubt housing for the denizens of these caverns. 
Strewn across the ground can be seen stone shards and dust, 
remains of mining or stone working.

   Wide stone stairs lead steeply upward here, the lips worn 
smooth, probably by lack of care on the parts of their creators. 
The air grows thicker as one descends, and a heavy darkness fills 
the corridor. It is fairly quiet here, the occasional distant 
screech or shuffling echoing through the tunnels. The passage 
continues to the south, the floor smoothed to allow ease of

Craggy Trail to a Bluff-Top Shanty Town~
   Leading away from the market, a small, well traveled trail is 
covered in ash and charred bones. It leads up to what was the 
Tur Edendor Shantytown, and is now a smoking pile of debris and 
corpses. Black Watch soldiers block off the path, not allowing 
anybody to disturb the mass grave, or get any closer to any 
potential khaskhas fumes not pushed aside by the wind. The 
adventurous may attempt to linger on the side of the rocks past 
the trail, but the ground is unsteady to say the least, and 
downright dangerous to say the worst, and it would be a short and 
brutal fall, punctuated by the untimely death of the brave rock 
climber.

End of a Craggy Trail Atop a Bluff~
   The perilous trail leading up to this bluff top slum comes to 
a sudden halt here (or a sudden beginning, depending entirely on 
one's perspective). As soon as the land widens into something 
approaching usable, it appears that people have used it, and 
erected shoddily constructed dwellings with stability and safety 
only marginally greater than the heavily-eroded bluff edge. The 
further away from the trail one travels, the denser the shanties 
have been crammed together, and indeed, the higher and more 
perilously they have been built. The streets, if they could be 
called that, between the buildings are narrow, no more than a few 
feet across, and one gets the sensation of enclosure almost 
instantly.

Densely Populated Shanty Town Atop a Bluff~
   The shanty town that branches out in all directions from this 
point is populated to a density that would offend any population 
with even a shred of compassion, with buildings made of crude 
materials with seemingly little design or plan, having been built 
upwards when ground space became too difficult to acquire - some 
buildings have even then built outwards from their shoddy second 
stories, enclosing smaller structures. In the narrow streets, 
it's very easy to lose one's sense of direction, and all but 
impossible to see anything beyond the immediate shanty town.

Cliffside Shanties~
   The street here runs along a bight in the bluff side, in a 
shallow crescent shape, and it is clear that only the desperate 
have created their dwellings on the cliff side of the street. 
The crude shanties on the other side must look as palaces to the 
wretches that are forced to live in the lean-tos and tents that 
sway and shake in even the slightest of winds by the edge of the 
bight. There are several gaps in the relatively dense assembly 
of houses on the cliff side, accompanied by similar gaps in the 
actual cliff itself. Down below, one can see piles of dirt, 
rocks, and building materials.

A Sparsely Developed Area About a Mudslide~
   The crude housing of the slums is uncharacteristically sparse 
about this area, owing to a large mudslide, which has flowed down 
from a higher peak of rock and soil on the bluff, and taken with 
it a sizeable chunk of the bluff-side architecture. The mudslide 
does not look recent, but it is still quite an unsteady ground 
and no one looks to have been bold enough to brave the site of 
the natural disaster. However, it does seem that people are 
willing to move through the area at least, and a well-walked path 
can be traced through the dried mud.

Densely Packed Shanties on the Edge of a Bluff~
   The bluff takes a sharp turn towards the northeast here, 
pressing the river of shanty houses closer to the craggy spire of 
rock that occasionally sends a boulder or two to stir things up 
down below. The narrow streets become even narrower, if such a 
thing could be believed, and a rider would have a difficult time 
staying atop a mount here, owing to all the head-level obstacles 
that protrude from the crude housing. At first, the ground seems 
to actually be paved with something, unlike the rest of the area, 
but upon further investigation one would learn that it is merely 
super-compacted waste, having been kicked over and trampled into 
a near-solid state. Needless to say, the area has quite a 
pungent aroma.

Shanties by a Large Fig Tree~
   The vaguely orderly rows of crude housing are broken up here 
by, of all things, a massive fig tree, obviously very old, which 
has for some reason not been removed. Instead, the houses have 
been diverted around it, creating a sort of circular bubble. All 
the lower branches of the fig tree have been cut off, and there 
are several places around the trunk where it seem as if people 
have tried to hack at the tree with an axe, but the tree is so 
thick and old that it has stubbornly refused to be cut down. 
Some of the houses have even incorporated the wood and foliage of 
the tree into their homes, albeit evidently because no more 
suitable materials were available.

A Densely-Packed Sea of Shanties About a Large Tent~
   This area contains many of the same, densely and crudely built 
shacks and other such homes as the rest of the surrounding area. 
The only significant difference is the fact that the buildings 
have been constructed in a relatively large square about a rather 
large tent. It seems that there is a large flow of people 
through this area, and it seems to be an area where people 
linger. As such, the buildings directly around the square have 
been rather heavily vandalized, and there is quite a significant 
volume of rubbish and other wastes.

An Intersection of Paths in a Bluff-Top Shanty Town~
   Several of the haphazardly constructed, winding paths through 
the abysmal housing of this area converge on this point. They 
would actually open up into a small circle, however, a large tent 
takes up most of the room, and indeed, some of the residents of 
the shanties surrounding the tent would need to squeeze past 
canvas just to enter their homes. A large amount of trash is 
strewn upon the ground, however, it is picked clean of anything 
useful.

streetdealing~
help~
vstr This street corner is ripe for setting up a local to sell khaskhas that you supply him with. When the street corner is occupied by someone, the dealer will sell 40 coins worth of khaskhas every 2 RL weeks, and give you 60 coins in return. The following commands can be used here: 
vbr -
vstr #6supply drugs#0: If you have the correct token, indicating you're the supplier or a friend thereof the street dealer has agreed to work with, have a crate of khaskhas, and there is a dealer on the corner who's currently looking for more khaskhas, then typing this will buy the crate of khaskhas from you for 60 coins, give you a token to indicate you're the correct supplier for next time, and tell you to come back in 2 RL weeks with more khaskhas.
vbr -
vstr #6wipeout street-dealer#0: If you want to kill the current street dealer here, and potentinally install your own, typing this will load allow you to try and kill the street dealer and his henchmen. After typing this, you will have 30 minutes to kill the NPCs that are loaded up, after which you can type...
vbr -
vstr #6clear street-corner#0: This command will only work after the previous has been typed, and the street dealer has been killed. Typing it will remove all the ownership flags, and leave the street corner with the corpse of the previous street dealer, which will last there for 7 RL days before the street becomes empty again.
vbr -
vstr #6claim street-corner#0: If you have a crate of khaskhas, and the street corner is free of a dealer either dead or alive, typing this will take your crate of khaskhas and put a street dealer loyal to you on the street corner. The first crate will have to be delivered free of charge in order to buy the man's loyalty, but all future crates will be bought for 150 coins.
vbr -
vstr If no one supplies a drug dealer for four weeks, he will abandon the street corner, allowing someone else to claim the street-corner. If you have a token, but the drugdealer is not accepting it, then someone has likely stolen the dealer away from you and you have an outdated token.

A Windy Path About an Outcropping of Rock~
   A large outcropping of rock rises here, creating a narrow and 
somewhat perilous path directly by the edge of the cliff. It 
would be rather difficult to lead a vehicle of any kind through 
here, and even a sure-footed mountain goat may have reservations 
about braving the path. Peeking over the edge of the path, one 
can see a rather prolonged and pointy fall, not a pleasant end by 
any means. Approximately half way along the path, a large 
section of what little path their was has fallen out from 
underneath the road, and by the looks of the rest of the path, 
the same could happen at any moment elsewhere along its length.

The Center of a Shanty Town~
   As far as an ordinary eye can see, in all directions, the 
wretched and crude shelters of a wretched and crude people can be 
seen clinging to rocks and cliffs like some kind of sentient 
lichen, and with a far more pungent odor than any fungus could 
muster. The dwellings to the west of this point appear slightly 
more permanent, stable, and ultimately, ever so slightly less 
likely to result in a slow and miserable death than the ones that 
stretch out to the east. This particular corner of the slum 
appears to be almost a border, and one can sense a certain level 
of tension between east and west. Not a particularly safe or 
enjoyable place to dwell at any time.

A Muddy Pit with Small Numbers of Rotten Homes~
   Drainage seems to be a problem for this corner of the bluff, 
and the soft, porous soil has become a muddy quagmire, sinking 
down into what is best described as a pit. Although it seems 
that good many people abandoned and dismantled their homes when 
this area sunk, some have stubbornly refused to do so, and a 
small number of rotten, soggy wooden shacks can be seen 
half-submerged in mud. Some of the more solid areas of rock have 
become used as pathways around the mud.

Crude Dwellings with a View of Tur Edendor~
   From the shoddily built shacks atop this bluff, one can see 
out over much of Tur Edendor, a view that would perhaps be 
particularly sought after were the surrounding area not so 
undesirable for wealthy land owners. With this in mind, some of 
the shacks on the view-side of the bluff are actually larger and 
more permanent than the others - evidently the more successful 
and strong of the locals. Unfortunately, their size and number 
makes it difficult to enjoy the view, only managing peeks between 
the buildings.

A Sudden End East to the Crude Dwellings~
   The wooden shacks and lean-tos of the bluff to the west come 
to a sudden stop here, and it is not difficult to see why - a 
cliff overhead drops a near constant shower of rocks and dirt 
which would make any residence set up beyond the line almost 
certain to be buried within days. Even as one walks along the 
stretch of ground, which has no path for any attempt to make one 
would be surely covered over, one is plagued by a rain dirt and 
small pebbles. It seems as if larger rocks do occasionally fall 
too, and so it is not wise to linger there too long. 
   An alleyway cuts northward through even more decrepit housing.

A Sharp Turn in a Craggy Path~
   The perilous cliff side path takes a sharp turn here, but 
widens, taking one out of the continuous stream of debris that 
falls to the west. The path leads down towards another section 
of town, and begins to have some kind of defined quality - a 
series of stones set out in an orderly fashion to mark the most 
even road.

Crudely Constructed Wooden Shelters Amongst a Sea of Shanties~
   In a slum marked by some of the most poorly constructed, 
scavenged, and dangerous places humanoids have ever chosen to 
live, this little corner of squalor stands out as the worst of 
the worst; the shelters are barely fit to bear that name, for 
they truly do not seem to do any real sheltering. The lean-to of 
a woodsman would be paradise to anyone forced to live in these 
conditions, for what passes for housing here is truly no more 
than piles of human waste and the rubbish that even other 
unfortunates could find no use for.

Shanties Upon a Snaking Plateau of Rock~
   A thin plateau of unsteady rock snakes gradually downwards 
here, a geometric obstacle for which the residents of this place 
have not fully compensated. The already unsteady shacks, 
lean-tos and shanties have had to take desperate measures to 
avoid collapsing under their own weight, leaning on the other 
structures downhill in a kind of desperate equilibrium. It isn't 
a perfect equilibrium though and several shacks have collapsed 
under the weight of their neighbors, leaving a broken landscape 
of miserable looking houses. The paths that twist through the 
housing are littered with all kinds of waste, and some of them 
come to unexpected dead-ends where a structure has been built in 
the middle of them.

Thinning Shanties Upon a Narrow Plateau~
   The steadily snaking plateau of rock becomes narrower and 
narrower the further it travels downwards, and the people that 
attempt to make their homes upon them evidently thin in a similar 
fashion, with the housing becoming more sparse. While a fall 
from the edge would be nasty, it is a little less likely to 
result in certain death, as it is not all that far above the 
ground.

generous girth to navigate without difficulty, leads down into a

crest-helmed soldiers of the Black Watch that march regularly in 
patrol from east to south venture not in that direction. Set up 
alongside the street, perched precariously in any flat spaces of 
land between the jagged rocks, are a number of crude tents and 
shanties, looking to be occupied by human residents.

women, never very many, walk on by, sometimes wandering into the

surrouned by sand dunes. Potted palms sit on either side of the

of the mountain wall of Tur Edendor, nothing borders either side

steep, the former direction leading higher up along the plateau, 
the latter down in to a busy market of farmers and trappers.

through this section of Tur Edendor, notably by as the path runs 
further south the denizens seem to be of darker skin, and more 
colourful garb, than the normal dull, rag clothing worn by humans 
in the town. Plain, yet well-built clay-brick housing jars oddly 
with the surrounding rocky bluff, the pale buildings contrasting 
against the dark mountains, the vibrant tarpaulins stretched out 
before the few dwellings here further adding to the oddness. A 
plain, drab-looking building fashioned of white-washed planks of 
wood is set on the northern edge of the road.

   The eastern and western skylines are immediately dominated by 
sheer black slopes of rock, irregular and drab wooden houses 
built before them on either side and occupied by a mix of dark, 
light and olive skinned humans, none looking to be particularly 
affluent. A number of men and women walk through the street, the 
men mostly naked and usually carrying something heavy, the women 
often carrying sacks of grain or buckets of water. The uncommon 
group of goblins, even more uncommonly led by a single, larger 
orc, shuffles past the houses, obviously uncomfortable above 
ground and surrounded by humans.

Valley-Like Street Leading Between Two High Rows of Rock By Two Shops.~
   The road here cuts from the south-west to the north-east, 
leading past two ten foot, sheer walls of black rock, pitted with 
many holes and cracks no doubt from the chill wind that always 
seems to blow in the air here. A number of tents, dyed strong 
colours and some decorated with patterns of circles and swirls, 
have been erected against either wall, forcing one to make a 
zig-zagging path between them. The smell of fresh milled lumber 
wafts out through the eastern door of a busy woodshop. Over the 
door to the south hangs a sign shaped as a helmet. At either end 
of the little valley stands a wooden post, at night lit with a 
bright torch.

Beneath a Rocky Bluff of the Ephel Duath~
   Rising up overhead, a rocky bluff juts out from the circle of 
Ephel Duath peaks, covered with all manner of rickety tent 
shanties and crude wooden shacks. The sprawl of dilapidated 
housing continues down a narrow, crooked path that leads down to 
this rocky plateau, the unwashed, long-haired men of unclear 
descent and their families that live in the tents when not our 
labouring in the city visible and audible. The occasional 
better-dressed merchant, or bronze-armoured soldier makes their 
way through the area, heading along the marked road that leads 
east and south.

Small Square About a Twisted Rowan Tree~
   The stone street that leads from east to west beneath the 
peaks of the Ephel Duath to the north split in to two for a short 
distance around an outcropping rock, and the small, twisted rowan 
tree which grows from it, roots visible as they spread down 
through the cracks in the stone. The leaves of the tree change 
with the season, and fallen and dead leaves clutter about the 
roots and the base of the rock. Bordering the tree on either 
side of the road are featureless wooden shacks, the occasional 
tent shanty amongst them, and a sewage drain dug in to the rock 
on the northern side.

Human Occupied Street of Near Identical White Washed Housing~
   Both the north and south sides of this street, before it 
curves slowly to the south at the eastern end, are bordered by 
near identical rows of single-storey, white-washed wooden 
housing, the carpentry plain but otherwise quite professional and 
the windows heavily shuttered. A few of the houses have large, 
leather-clad and brutish looking porters by their doors, a few 
others have small, potted plants and trees by their doors. Lamps 
hang from each awning, casting this street beneath the wall of 
stubby peaks to the north in a moderate light during the night.

Turn in the Street North and East, Past a Large Flophouse~
   The street of flat stone is forced to curve from the north to 
the east here by a large outcropping of rock that rises up to the 
south-west, but built before that is a multi-leveled flophouse, 
human labourers of all colours entering and leaving through the 
broad door at all hours of the day and night. The many windows 
of the lodgings are shuttered securely, and at the fall of night 
the two lamps set before the door are lit. The building itself 
is unadorned, constructed of plain, white-washed wood like the 
houses on the opposite side of the street.

Curving Street of Wooden and Cave Houses~
   The mountain-side street makes a gentle curve from the south 
to the west here, the north-eastern edge of the stone path the 
black walls of the Ephel Duath. A number of shallow caves, with 
tents extended from the entrances and some crude wooden shacks, 
are occupied by wild-haired, long-bearded men and their families, 
a fire often roasting some stew to the side of the street. On 
the opposite side of the road, short yet solidly constructed 
wooden houses have been built in a neat row, perhaps a dozen of 
them, the whitewash upon their walls the only decoration but the 
doors and tiles constructed with a chill efficiency, like the 
pale-skinned people seem occasionally entering and leaving them.

Rock-Carved Street Before a Store Smelling of Flowers~
   The street and cobblestones here have been carved directly in 
to the rock underfoot. A sewage channel has been dug along the 
south-eastern edge of the rockwall, and crude, preliminary 
carvings have been made upon the street surface, too vague to be 
distinguished as anything of note, and ending soon to the east 
and south. A building constructed of black stone and built up 
against the western mountain peak emits a strong floral smell, 
the aroma hanging in the air here even as the cold breezes of Tur 
Edendor stir the beaded curtains in the doorway of the store. A 
study iron gate blocks the way north.

Track Weaving Through the Rock~
   A path two people wide zig zags back and forth as it climbs 
from the low martial yards, where the various mercenaries and 
warbands housed in Tur Edendor gather. Orcs and humans can be 
seen sparring and working the forges across the other side of the 
yard, lit by the orange-red glow of the forges at now and 
belching forth clouds of smoke up past the ring of craggy points 
that forms the boundary of the settlement. At the top of the 
trail, two paths branch off down two seperate streets, to the 
west the majority of buildings made of stone, and to the north 
most fashioned from wood.

Martial Grounds Occupied by Physicians, Sawbones and Chirugeons~
   The low sounds of humanoids groaning, bleeding, hurting and 
dying are never far from this corner of the martial grounds of 
the city, bordered by the sloping rock faces east and north. At 
work are a number of physicians, sawbones, and chirugeon, 
operating out of hide tents and crude shacks, busy treating 
hacked bones and missing limbs of the various rough-looking 
individuals that come hobbling in to the area with the aid of 
their friends or family. Not only dire ailments look to be 
treated here, but more rudimentary problems and illnesses; rotted 
teeth are pulled, boils lanced, and in one bead and feather 
decorated tent, rituals chanted and bones waved. All of this is 
accompanied by the constant patter of the feet of the numerous 
assistants, rushing back and forth carrying buckets of water, 
bandages, and bloodied saws. To the east a tattered curtain 
covers the entrance to tiny lean-to. Groaning emits from behind 
the tattered curtain and the occasional scream pierces the air.

Through the Rows of Busy Baking Ovens~
   Here is where all the milled produce of South Ithilien is 
baked and cooked in to bread for the labourers, the mercenaries, 
the traders, the Black Watch and rulers of Tur Edendor. Numerous 
crest-helmed guards keep vigilant patrol of the area, ensuring 
that the slave bakers marked by the lightning bolt brand on their 
cheeks are not interfered with. Heat radiates from the ovens 
that are constantly at work, the bakers work night and day. 
Other men and women bake their bread too, most bearing the 
markings of one warband or another.

Slaving Grounds before the Kennels and a Small, Stone Chapel~
   The bawdy calls of an orc or goblin wearing a patch marked 
with a whip is ever-present here, sheltered beneath the shade of 
a tarpaulin stretched before a quickly-constructed wooden 
building assembled before the northern face of the mountain. 
Despite the bragging claims, only a few, thin and meek looking 
slaves are for sale here, never more than half a dozen, all 
looking appropriately resigned at their situation. Apart from 
the occasional gaudily dressed Haradun or finely-attired 
Numenorean, few attention is paid to the sales, but more people 
move to and fro between the kennels inside to the north. To the 
west, a small building of grey stones and with a peaked roof of 
dull red tiles stands.

Dusty Ground about the Well~
   Only a handful of disheveled looking men, orcs, women or 
goblins crowd about this area, no more than two or three at a 
time, and murmur quietly amongst themselves. Those individuals 
who do linger seem to be dressed in rotted or old leathers, 
ragged hides or tattered clothes. Crest-helmed soldiers patrol 
the area, scattering those few people who do remain, and walk 
their beat from the wealthy suburbs of the city from which a 
paved street leads. An old well is the central focus of this

   The rough dirt mesa of Tur Edendor has been divided in to a 
number of rope plots here, some shaded during the day by thick 
tarpaulins, the others open to the elements. The ground is 
stained dark in many places, and the aroma of sweat hangs heavy 
in the air here, a number of burly, leather-clad figures lurking 
around the rings watching similar individuals bash at one another 
with blunted weaponry. A pair of crest-helmed soldiers can be 
seen constantly moving through the various fighting arenas, 
ensuring that the combat does not turn too deadly. The martial 
grounds of the city extend in all directions from here.

Labour Work Before a Winding Mountain Trail~
   Wooden scaffolding rises about the stumpy, low peaks of the 
Ephel Duath that sit either side of the eastward trail, but 
remains empty during the day, only the cold breezes that come 
from the higher ranges of the mountains stirring the various rags 
and dust on the platforms to movement. Gathered at the base of 
the structure is an inmeasurable amount of rock dust and chips, 
obviously fallen from the surface of the peaks which appear to be 
in the process of being smoothed. Black Watchmen can at times be 
seen coming and going through here patrolling along the trail 
which leads up to another plateau, where a somber graveyard has 
been erected.

   Wooden scaffolding rises about the stumpy, low peaks of the 
Ephel Duath that sit either side of the eastward trail, and 
dozens of goblins dressed only in rags work at shaping the 
mountain smooth. Below them, at the base of the structure, burly 
orcs work at cutting large blocks of stone in to small, square 
blocks of stone, grunting and bellowing amongst themselves. All 
this takes place under the shouted directions of the heavy-set 
Yrchish foremen, occasionally cracking their whip at the workers.
Black Watchmen can often be seen coming and going even during the 
night, patrolling along the trail which leads up to another 
plateau, where a number of splendid, colourful and large tents 
have been erected.

Stench-Ridden Tanning Yards~
   Well known to the be only place one can legally tan within the 
mountain walls of Tur Edendor, a number of leather-workers have 
taken that opportunity, busy preparing the fresh hides taken from 
any variety of animals. The skins of deer, warg, wolf, bear, 
lynx, horse, cow, and even human and yrch can be spotted being 
treated with alum, the work generating a near unbearable stench. 
Despite the swift wind descending from the mountain peaks with 
lie to the south and east, the smell is enough to make most 
people's eyes water, that is, except for the tanners, who go 
happily about their business, evidently mercifully deprived of 
their sense of smell some time past. Along the southern edge, 
many low containers have been cut in to the stone, filled from a 
stream of water that runs above them from the east.

Lumber Yard About a Mountain Stream~
   A thin stream of clear, crisply cold water flows from a spring 
coming from behind an outcropping of black rock on the southern 
face of the surrounding mountains, and a intricate path has been 
carved in to the rock to lead the water down in to the lumbermill 
to turn the wheels and spin the gears and cogs fast enough to 
facilitate the numerous timberwrights that lay felled trees at 
one end of the machine and leave carrying numerous pieces of 
lumber. The occasional belch of arcid smoke blows in from the 
forges to the west, likewise does a cloud of even more foul aroma 
from the east. A large cavern hole set a distance away from the 
lumbermill leads down in to the warrens of Tur Edendor.

Open-Aired Foundry Works~
   A thin, hazy cloud of smoke blows through the martial yards 
here, but not for long before being whisked away by the stiff 
breezes of the city. The circular furnace belches out its smoke 
as it is worked near constantly by a constant stream of 
half-naked orcs and humans, their produce carried over to the 
sweating blacksmiths that work at the forges and anvils, the 
beating of hammers a constant assailment of noise. In between 
the heavy men at work dodge and dart smaller humans and goblins, 
ferrying rivets, studs, straps, and piles of scale and ring for 
their respective employers. The entire area is alive with the 
production of armour and weaponry, from crude yet effective 
falchions and beaten plate helmets to delicate and exotic 
blade-designs from far distant lands. 

A rounded door has been set into the southern rock wall, a large, 
tattered banner painted with a white skull hanging above it.

channel runs parallel to the street on the southern side of it, 
all manner of waste sluggishly flowing through it. On both sides 
of the road large houses elegantly constructed from wood and 
stone rise up several floors, and a regular patrol of 
bronze-armoured men walk through the area. Two large palm trees 
border a manor to the north, cultivated in a pair of massive 
earthenware pots that are constantly tended by black-skinned men.

   This broad, paved road runs from north to south, passing by 
numerous large estates currently under construction, at night 
swarming with goblin labourers working on the roof and about the 
crude scaffoldings, and at day muscled men work the plots of dirt 
and plant small trees. The traffic along the street is composed 
mostly of bronze-helmed figures, the dreaded Black Watch, 
ensuring law and order is maintained in the rich district of the 
city, occasionally a well-dressed, haughtily-featured individual 
walking up and down the street as well. A small oaken sign with 
a ring painted on it hangs over the western doorway.

in rain. The white flagstones lead one past extravagant housing, 
set behind half-constructed stone walls and iron gates, some of

mountain rock. Private guards can be seen to patrol about the 
grounds there, while the crest-helmed Black Watch maintain a

Broad, Paved Street Before a Large Sandstone Building~
   The northern side of the street here is dominated by a large, 
sandstone building, composed of three levels and two wings which 
arch out, each of these bearing a massive flag of dark purple and 
trimmed in gold, the symbol of crossed lightning bolts piercing a 
silver halo prominent in the centre of it. The wide double doors 
at the base of the building are left constantly open, the 
occasional person venturing inside. Opposite the grand building 
are a number of similarly lavish buildings, the occasional potted 
tree visible, a rarity in the mesa of Tur Edendor. The street

Winding Trail Up to the City Graveyard~
   This trail, although it winds up and down as it leads between 
the mesa and the martial yards of the city, is broad, relatively 
flat, and paved with close-set stones. A slight amount of 
traffic moves up and down the trail, its path weaving below low 
towers of black rocks, small groups of men, a lone guardsman, the 
even rarer orc or goblin scurrying about.

Mesa Before the Graveyard~
   The barren mesa stretches out a good distance, punctured in 
the centre by a massive spear of black rock that seperates the 
eastern half of the rocky platform in two. Erected some distance 
from this spire, and between the wall of mountains that borders 
the mesa to the north, east, south and west, is a large, iron 
fenced graveyard, a single black-iron gate of similiar make 
leading in and out of the somber place. At times, the occasional 
Black Watchman can be seen patrolling near the gate.

Underneath the Gigantic, Elaborately-Coloured Tent~
   Four stout oak beams have been driven in to the ground a dozen 
yards from each other here, and many more smaller poles hold up 
the mass of specially treated canvas that hangs overhead. 
Metal-encased lamps burn a bright light over the multitude of 
well-dressed aristocrats and rag-clad slaves alike as they bustle 
about, moving between the wood-partitioned rooms beneath the 
tent. The centre of the structure is occupied by a spartan 
throne upon a wooden dais, a half dozen crest-helmed soldiers of 
the Black Watch stationed about it at all times. Two massive 
tent flaps open out to a tent-occupied mesa to the south, a pair 
of burly slaves keeping them open for the genteelfolk that move 
in and out of the tent.

Under the Gatehouse to Tur-Edendor~
   In the broad space set between the fortified western gate and 
cast-iron portcullis that leads in to the city of Tur Edendor, a 
dozen figures in crest-helms and bronze platemail have organised 
a checkpoint of all traffic that moves from east to west. Every 
cart hauled by a farmer is given a brief look over, and all 
travelers ordered to present themselves to ensure they are not 
escaping slaves, captive, or wanted outlaws. A broad, straight 
set of stairs leads from the north to up on to atop of the wall.

Before a Squat Gatehouse Nestled Between Two Stubby Peaks~
   The winding mountain trail that creeps in from the west comes 
to an end before a row of weather-blunted peaks of black stone to 
the east, a gap in the wall of rock filled by instead a wall of 
cut stone, with a broken and burned gate set into it. Through 
the gaps can be seen a huge pile of boulders, debris and 
inaccessible destruction. A city burned here at some point in 
time and all that is left is ruins.

Upon the Stone Battlements of the City~
   The battlements of Tur Edendor lead from the north to the 
south, but only a short distance in the latter direction, a blunt 
peak of black rock forming the end of the thick, carved-stone 
wall. The crest-helmed soldiers of the Black Watch march up and 
down past the thick crenelations erected on the western side of 
the wall, some with a valgash rested on their shoulder, others 
holding longbows, all keeping close watch on the winding trail 
which leads through the narrow valley and up to the gates below. 
A set of stone stairs leads down inside the gatehouse, the wall 
continues to the north, while a wooden platform leads south on to 
the surrounding peaks.

A Small, Sparse Messhall~
   A stone overhang juts from the stone wall to the north, 
creating a natural ceiling for this area. Wooden walls have been 
erected to keep the weather out, and a small flat area has been

cooking fire stand against the wooden wall to the south, and a 
few shelves and hooks hold utensils and ingredients behind a 
wooden counter where people shuffle by to receive their rations.

"The Shattered Skull" Waterhole~
   Perhaps only five feet in height, this rickety wooden 
structure is separated from the rest of the Orkish warrens by a 
heavy curtain fashioned of humanoid bones bound together by long, 
greasy strands of hair that has taken the place of one of the 
walls. A heavy slab of stone is set before a series of stout, 
oaken barrels arranged before the western wall, a sturdy doorway 
visible between them, a empty torch-ring illuminating the mold 
and lichen that grows there. Four pits lead downwards from the 
entryway, each of pits holding a table there. The descending 
stairs are all slippery with moss. A silence hangs over the 
stone slab central in the empty building but the warrens clamour 
with the noise of the market outside, and every now and again a 
few orcs poke their head in and stay for a drink.

crude table, lead downwards from the entryway, the descending 
stairs all slippery with moss. Dark-skinned humans and goblins
dwell about the central stone slab, the warrens quiet outside.

Communal Hall of the Manor~
   This rounded room has been carved from marble, six pillars 
arranged in a hexagonal pattern a foot from the outer wall and 
upper floor formed of polished wooden boards. The centre of the 
room is set three steps down, the floor there covered by reeds 
and rushes. A number of low, walnut-wood tables surrounded by 
plush pillows occupy this lower stage within the hall. There is 
no other furniture or features present in the room, save for the 
hanging bronze lanterns that burn sweet perfume in the air, and 
corridors leading off north, east and west.

A Cramped Sideroom off the Hut~
   Dirty water trickles in from the holes in the tiled roof when 
it rains and gathers in tiny puddles in the corner of the room, 
only to drain back into the hard-packed floor of dirt. Some 
planks have been laid out across the ground as a more comfortable 
and presentable floor and the same wood is used to roughly cover 
gaps in the uneven and crumbling wall. A stained door on wobbly 
hinges gives way to a slightly bigger room than this cramped one.

Octagonal Room Stuffed with Humanoid-Inhabited Cages and Cells~
   The dank stone walls of this eight sided room are barely 
visible behind the cells and cages of all shapes and sizes that 
are welded to thick iron rings on the floor, or are suspended 
from the ceilings. Goblins, grotesque half-breeds, orcs, and 
humans of all manner of backgrounds are interred behind the iron 
and bronze bars, a few screaming and shouting in an awful 
clamour, but the majority try to sleep amidst the anarchy of 
noise. Occasionally, a pack of prisoners enter from the north, 
clustering around a particularly noisome caged denizen and 
prodding and kicking them.

cages caged prisoners goblins humans bars cells pack denizen~
   Inside the cages are all manner of men, orcs, goblins, and
half-breeds, some interred in the cells set along the walls,
other, unluckier humanoids suspended from the cages that hang
from the high roof. It is these unfortunate souls that are
the subject of much torment from the pack of near-naked prisoners;
a common game amongst them seems to be grabbing hold of a cage,
pull back, and letting it swing, the process invaribly leading
to many other cages to be struck, and causing howlings of rage
to flood the entire room. This, of course, is accompanied by
raucous laughter from the prisoners.

Crowded Gaol Filled with Near-Naked Prisoners~
   The walls of this oblong-shaped room are filled with naked or 
near-naked prisoners, none wearing anything more than a bundle of 
greasy rags wrapped about their midsection. While no more than 
fifty undesirables look to have been tossed down here, the narrow 
spaces forces goblinoids and men side by side, the different 
species and races eyeing each other off nervously as they cluster 
in their respective corners of the room. Occasionally a squad of 
crest-helmed Black Watch soldiers move through the room, dragging 
a mewling, pathetic example of humanity or orkin, their presence 
sending the gaol population huddling as close to the walls as 
they can manage.

Exclusive, Dank Wing of the Gaol~
   Scar and tattooed covered humans and orcs sit together or lean 
against the cold, dark, stone walls in unison here, talking 
quietly amongst themselves and directing sharp, cold gazes to 
anyone seemingly not one of the gaolhouse clique. Compared to 
the distant pained howls and manic screams that echo in from the 
west, a quiet, gentle and patient murder of men holds here, 
interspersed by the a clatter of dice. A dull, grimy light 
filters down from a single lantern, set hanging from the high 
roof, unreachable by even the tallest of men.

veterans humans orcs prisoners clique group~
   These prisoners seem to have been down here a long, long
time. Most of them are thin, but look all the more intimidating
for it, covered in home-made tattoos and crude, self-inflicted
scarring. Unlike the naked mass of prisoners to the west, these
orcs and men are dressed from neck to knee in crude, rag-formed
garments. The occasional pair roll dice, arm wrestle, and even
on occasion light up a roll of smokeleaf! The dirtier, thiner
and far more naked prisoners of the general population can
sometimes be seen in ones or twos talking to the veteran prisoners,
trying to blend in with the crowd, occasionally being awarded
with scraps or food; or a savage beating.

   #6If you want, you can also try to "blend in" with the
   group of veteran prisoners.#0

The "Strange Brew" Tavern~
   Tasteful tapestries decorate the wood and stone walls of this 
large, well appointed tavern, offering the eye a wide variety of 
visual gratification. A dark-stained, wooden floor has been 
masterfully laid, covered in places by plush carpeting, each 
woven with its own design yet set to match the extravagant decor. 
Ornate, wooden doors are set in the northern, eastern and 
southern walls, the latter set between a pair of smoky, 
glass-paned windows. A long, rich red banner is set upon the 
western wall over the expanse of the bar but the black eye that 
had formerly been set in its center has been covered by a large, 
thick square of white cloth. On this cloth is the mark of a 
sejant blowfly. Set upon the eastern wall beside the door is a 
massive, gild-framed painting depicting a solidly-muscled, 
grim-faced man.

   Damp and dark inside, this tavern is entirely built from 
crudely strapped together wood. The roof slants sharply upwards, 
giving a space in the middle tall enough for the largest of 
trolls. Oily brackish lanterns sit intermittently along the 
walls, hanging from where the roof meets the sides to cast a dim 
light over the tables and stools. During the day, a number of 
humans of various skin tones have gathered about the tavern, from 
the ghostly pale to charcoal black and all manner inbetween. The 
tavern seems somewhat more crowded than usual, orcs and goblins 
hard to spot amongst the crowd of humans clustered beneath the 
roof away from the rain that falls outside.

A steel gladius is laid across his lap, and he holds the pole of a banner emblazoned with an iron fist clutching twin lightning bolts, the fabric twisted by the grasp of his other hand about its falling folds. Beneath his armored boots, a legion of dark, tiny armored figures lances out with long viciously-edged polearms at a shapeless mass of white, only the faintest suggestion of human forms in the cloud-like contrast.

   Crudely cut planks of wood make up both the floors and the 
walls all the way down this hallway. The ground shows strong 
signs of wear, muddy boots and other scrape marks have begun to 
deteriorate the recent construction already. Doors are built 
into the halls length, offering rooms for rent in the Inn. The 
hallway is quiet enough that the loud bustle of patrons 
downstairs can be clearly heard, the voices of men with an 
undertone of rasping orcish. There are many marks on the walls 
already where a stray weapon has hit the wood, and even a few 
dark patches that can only be dried crusted blood. Though the 
wood is fresh enough to scent the air, it is mostly oppressed by 
the bustling population downstairs.

A Dirty Wooden Hallway~
   Rooms line the walls of this hallway as the upper floor of the 
Inn provides a place for the inhabitants of the city to rent a 
room. The bustling crowd below can be heard quite clearly 
through the wooden floor, the many voices of men mixing with the 
few grunted sounds of orc and goblin kind. Gritty trails of 
dried mud lead to many of the rooms, the recently constructed 
hallway already sullied by many dirt encrusted feet and boots. 
Scuff marks line the walls and doors in many places, the effects 
of the odd scrape, fight, or perhaps over zealous drunken patron.

A Grimy Floored Wooden Hallway~
   Crudely cut planks of wood make up both the floors and the 
walls all the way down this hallway. The ground shows strong 
signs of wear, muddy boots and other scrape marks have begun to 
deteriorate the recent construction already. Doors are built 
into the halls length, offering rooms for rent in the Inn. The 
hallway is quiet enough that the loud bustle of patrons 
downstairs can be clearly heard, the voices of men with an 
undertone of rasping orcish. There are many marks on the walls 
already where a stray weapon has hit the wood, and even a few 
dark patches that can only be dried crusted blood. Though the 
wood is fresh enough to scent the air, it is mostly oppressed by 
the bustling population downstairs.

Inside a Rusted Iron Cage, Suspended From the Ceiling~
   The cramped iron cage looks to be rusted and weak, the metal 
creaking and groaning as it swings back and forth over the floor 
of the jailhouse, suspended from the ceiling and surrounded by 
dozens of other cages holding despondent goblins and men. The 
door is set to the east, the bolt upon it less worn than the rest 
of the cage. It is impossible to stand in the cage; instead, 
one's legs must dangle down through the thin bars that form the 
base of the rusty iron frame.

A Small, Simple Bedroom~
   The walls of this small, spare room are painted white, the 
constant noise and bustle of the tavern beyond drifting through 
only partially muffled. The smells of meat roasting and ale 
fermenting often permeate the air in this room. The creaking 
floorboards are warped in many places, obviously the product of 
rushed if sturdy enough craftsmanship. A shuttered window opens 
out on the nothern wall and the garden beyond, allowing for a 
relatively fresh breeze and, if it's daytime, light in the room. 
A small stone fireplace is set in the wall next to the window.

Bounty Office, Rat Collector, and Money Changer~
   A rounded alcove of sandstone blocks has been fashioned here, 
seperated from the main hallway to the east by an elegant 
archway. The office here is rather small, holding little save a 
long, curved table that follows the shape of the room, stacked 
high with numerous parchemts and ledgers. The stone walls are 
covered with sheets of paper, all bearing a crude sketch of some 
disagreeable looking human or orc, and a scribbling of writing 
beneath it. From time to time, groups of leather-clad denizens 
lurk in to the office, looking over the various posters before 
leaving again on their way. A number of other businesses take 
place here, the monies of far off lands being exchanged for 
Edendorian Engrens, and scab-faced, dirt-covered beggars handing 
over bundles of rat tails for coins.

Civics Office of Tur Edendor~
   This large sandstone building has been decorated with 
tapestries and war-banners, all of expert weave and looking far 
older than the chiseled blocks of stone. Scenes of glorious 
victory by bronze-armored figures over barbarian hordes peer down 
from the walls, but most prominent is a large flag of dark 
purple, emblazoned upon it in gold a depiction of crossed 
lightning bolts, piercing a silver halo. A set of richly stained 
wooden doors opens out on to the street to the south, and 
numerous corridors and alcoves lead off from this main hall of 
petitions. A few people can be seen lingering here at all times, 
both well-dressed merchants and scruffy farmers.

Property Office~
   The sandstone walls of this small alcove are blank, the entire 
room looking drab and unassuming, only the richly hued wooden 
floorboards granting it any character. A bland, rectangular 
table has been set in the centre of the room, the paperwork upon 
it occasionally added to or removed by black-clothed scribes who 
shuffle about the Civics Hall with downcast eyes. The air is 
cool here, and without any particular aroma; strangely 
non-descript, just as the rest of the room is.

bricking lines the floor, dirt showing between the cracks in many 
place and making the floor rough to walk over. Heavy, grated 
doors stand to the north and west, behind which the general 
prison population of Tur Edendor resides, shuffling about amongst 
one another, occasionally shouting or screaming as they descend 
in to violence. The hallway continues to the east.

A Bleak Path through Mountains Lined with Burnt and Broken Flag Poles~
   Sheer slopes of the ring of mountains that forms a protective 
boundary rise up and form the walls of this narrow valley as it 
descends smoothly from east to south, bending sharply as it does 
so. Set alongside the stone road that follows the curves of the 
valley are four broken down flag poles, which at one time were 
easily taller than the tallest of men. A chill wind is often 
funneled down on to the path by the tall mountain tops.

Mountain Trail Passing by a Round, Shadowy Stone Building~
   The mountain trail leading from the ruins of Tur Edendor and 
greater South Ithilien takes a broad turn from north to west 
here, the road making a large, gentle curve about a crooked pile 
of rock that juts southward. The path has been fashioned out of 
broad pavers, a dusky grey in colour, cut in to squares and 
placed tightly against one another; quite a few of the pavers 
have been cracked and broken, suggesting that the trail has seen 
some rough treatment in the near past. On the southern side of 
the trail, eastward of the jutting rock, is a small, rounded 
building of stone, the archway leading in to it barred by no 
door. Noticeably, the foliage around the building seems to have 
wilted and died, turning it shadowy shades of green and brown.

Floral-Smelling Storefront~
   Despite the crudity of Tur Edendor, this floral smelling 
storefront, bearing such exotic wares as pungent perfumes and 
scented candles, is quite busy, the mainstay of customers being

Cavernous Fighting Pit~
   This circular cavern tapers down to a relatively small flat 
pit of rock covered in a layer of coarse dirt, the descent over 
four rows of wooden benches affixed crudely to the layered rings 
of black rock, several paths of steps allowing one to walk 
between the levels with ease. No natural lighting is present, 
the torches that burn from iron brackets granting but a dim light 
to the fighting pit. The eastern wall of the pit is covered by a 
large wooden gate, set below it is a broad door that opens 
outwards, while on the opposite wall at the top of the stairs a 
number of iron bars have been set before some hollows in the 
cave-wall, snarls and barks heard from within.

Betting Hollow~
   This little hollow breaks off from the main cavern of the 
fighting pit to the south, navigating a sharp, jutting rock 
required before stepping in to the dirt-covered floor here. A 
wooden booth has been arranged across the northern side of the 
hollow, a number of slateboards covered in an ancient layer of 
chalk nailed to it. A single lamp burns on the booth, dismal 
light flickering with the cool breeze that seeps in through the 
numerous cracks that run through the roof here.

A Heavily-Damaged Pier Over Deep Waters~
   The weatherworn planks of this pier have been splintered and 
scattered, a huge section of the walkway and pier destroyed. 
Many of the planks of wood lie scattered upon the mossy rocks 
below, and still more lurks as flotsam in the deep, relatively 
still waters just offshore. From the looks of the wood, it would 
have seen far better days even before whatever magnificent event 
destroyed this structure. A ways to the northwest the great 
walls of Osgiliath loom into the air, bending northward toward a 
domed building that stretches across the river to rejoin with the 
eastern half of Osgiliath on the other side.

The Forward Keel of a Shipwrecked Galleon~
   This is the fowardmost section of the ship's keel, the very 
skeleton of the hull. It has sustained enormous structural 
damage, and in many places the lateral planks holding the hull 
together have buckled or snapped under the pressure. The area 
seems to have been cleared of most anything that would've been 
here in an operational ship, or at least, it may have slid 
further into the ship as it is angled towards the stern.

The Upper Hold of a Shipwrecked Galleon~
   This would have been the upper deck of the ship's hold, where 
the more oft-accessed cargo (such as the ship's food, and other 
necessities) would've been kept. It appears to have been cleaned 
out now, and all that remains are the iron rings and wooden 
planks of a few collapsed barrels. There is a rope ladder 
leading up to the deck, and a rickety, damaged wooden stair 
leading deeper down into the hold.

The Deck of a Shipwrecked Galleon~
   Atop the Galleon's deck, the situation looks worse than it 
does from shore. Splinters of wood are everywhere, and there 
also some patches of dried blood. The fore and aft sails have 
been removed, however the main sail, attached to the centre mast 
that now rests upon the crushed remains of the forward cabin, is 
still here, although torn asunder such that it will never be 
salvaged. The port side of the deck has been collapsed and bent 
as the ship made impact with the dock, and were one to approach 
the edge, one could see the dark green waters of the river below, 
between the ship and the rocks that form the shore.

The Water-Filled Hold of a Shipwrecked Galleon~
   Descending deeper into the hold, one finds it to be partially 
submerged, only half way to the knee of an average man at this 
end owing to the aftward sloping of the vessel, but icy cold, 
filled with a murky grey silt, and almost entirely still. The 
structural breach that allowed the water in must be below the 
water line, so it is likely further down into the hold. The hull 
itself creaks and cracks, and an observant occupant would notice 
that many of the supporting pillars for the upper hold and the 
deck above have been damaged or destroyed.

Deeper into the Underbelly of a Shipwrecked Galleon~
   The water in this section of the hold has risen to about 
shoulder height on an average sized man, however, the 
silt-covered hull beneath feels rotten and unstable, and one 
could easily become stuck or fall through. The only light is 
provided by small breaches in the hull that provide light from 
the outside. To the east, the hold ends, and the steerage

The Main Steerage Area of a Shipwrecked Galleon~
   The steerage of the ship, which would normally house 
passengers or perhaps crew in living quarters has been refitted 
to hold additional cargo. The hallway, which is totally 
submerged but for maybe a foot of space between the water's level 
and the roof, at least at the westernmost end, leads off into 
many smaller chambers, although much of the flimsily constructed 
retainer walls that seperated the booths from one another has 
been completely ruined in the impact, making the steerage almost 
as a second hold.

Underwater in the Steerage of a Shipwrecked Galleon~
   The dank, murky waters that fill the ship's steerage are 
disturbed largely only by your presence here, which makes it even 
harder to see as the silt and muck that sat upon the floor of the 
area is stirred up by the newly created current. Many of the 
compartments have had their internal walls broken apart, and the 
actual breach of the external hull that created the flooding 
appears to come from this section.

Atop a Small Wooden Tower~
   This small tower, made mostly of wood, is constructed for 
seemingly occasional use. It is rather tall for its girth, at 
perhaps a storey and a half in height, and contains a platform 
with a canvas roof. Upon the platform is a reasonably large pile 
of organized lumber, several pitchers of oil, and flint and 
steel. It is evidently some kind of beacon, though the details 
of its use are perhaps unknown.

   This section of the battlements of Tur Edendor leads past a 
veil of rock to the west, preventing a view of South Ithilien and 
the trail that leads up to it, though partial glimpses of the 
terrain can be gained by looking south-west and the walls there. 
A stout flag pole of wood has been erected on the eastern edge of 
the battlements, the crossed-lightning bolts of Tur Edendor 
flapping in the wind, and beside it a hatch opens up and leads 
down in to the feared gaolhouse of the settlement. Thick black 
obsidian walls rise up to the north.

The Black Watch Guardhouse Foyer~
   Gray brick walls surround this large gathering place and send 
a clear message out of security. Heavy doors blocks travel to 
the east, banded with iron and reinforced with a heavy bar placed 
across its length to make it hold up against a fair share of 
battering if necessary. Large banners hang from the walls 
showing a gauntlet gripping a lightning bolt surrounded by a 
field of black. A few tables have been left in this hall in an 
organized fashion far away from the southern side of the room, 
where a stone set of stairs leads both up and down, an oaken door 
at the top.

A Spacious, Stark Barracks~
   Rows of neatly lined wooden bunks stand in perfect file and 
order in this room, the ceiling being nearly twice the height of 
the average man to accommodate them and leave room to spare. 
This barracks is neat and orderly, cabinets for supplies sitting 
in one corner while footlockers line each bunk bed, shaded in 
differing colors. The cool, gray stone walls of this room are 
bare and nearly undecorated. The chamber itself is large and 
spacious, and with its lack of furniture and decorum it could 
likely hold near to a hundred people at once if necessary, making 
the place feel even more empty with its current lack of filled 
space.

In the Air Before the Sheer Slopes of the Ephel Duath~
   "Whoops!" is the thought that enters your mind, having fallen 
from the rim of peaks that provides the barrier and border of Tur 
Edendor and now occupying the chill air off the slopes of the 
Ephel Duath. The only direction for you to take now is... down, 
down to the jagged rocks below.

Wooden Boardwalk Constructed Along the Rim of Tur Edendor~
   These wooden boardwalks, sturdy enough to walk on, have been 
built around the rim of peaks that forms the outer border of Tur 
Edendor, the black rocks of the Ephel Duath forming a natural 
crenelation for the archers of the Black Watch that patrol here. 
An impressive view of all of South Ithilien can be seen here, no 
doubt the point of this structure, forming a formidable defense 
against any attacking force. To the south, the boardwalk leads 
down to the western wall of Tur Edendor.

Chill Interior of a Rounded Stone Building~
   This circular stone building is quite large, the outer rim of 
it lined by straw pallets, looking none too fresh. The ceiling 
has been fashioned of loose clay tiles, leading up to a point in 
the centre of the room, and is quite high overhead. A few 
missing tiles gives a view of distant, bleak peaks, and allows 
for a chill wind to creep in and stir about between the 
stone-block walls. On the northern side of the building, a 
square entryway leads outside to a trail that winds its way up 
the valley.

   In this room you can buy Harad and Corsair-specific clothing, 
that is unavailable in the rest of the newbie-shopping complex 
and will be difficult (and much more expensive) to find in the 
game itself. Remember, anything purchased in the newbie-shopping 
complex are things your character had on them before coming to 
Tur Edendor and Mordor. To the north is the general area of the 
shopping complex, where you can go after to buy more common 
items, and to enter the game proper.

The Leather Armour and Leather Goods Store~
   In this store you can buy both leather armour and leather 
goods. Metal armour is restricted to people of rank in Tur 
Edendor, and to those people of a registered warband; unless you 
have chosen a role, this does not include your character. 
Wearing metal armour without permission inside the city is 
punished by confiscation, and a beating. Outside the city, 
however, the Black Watch does not care. 

To access the second shopkeeper, type #6list 2.shopkeep#0 and 
#6buy 2.shop x#0.

do well to note the PREVIEW command (see #6HELP PREVIEW#0) before 
you buy some of the things. Anything that exists to be purchased 
that is not in here will need to be purchased in game. Be sure 
to check the material requirements of any crafts you may have 
(#6HELP GENERAL CRAFTS#0, #6HELP MATERIALS#0) for tools you may 
require in the game proper.

The Clothing Store~
   In this store you can find clothing, jewelry, and other such 
worn paraphernalia. Please make sure that you choose clothing 
that is appropriate to both your character, and your character's 
position in the social strata. Wearing silver or gold is illegal 
in Tur Edendor unless you are of rank; unless you have picked a 
role, your character is not of rank. This includes both silver 
and gold jewelry, and weapons or clothing decorated with solid 
silver or gold (threads and dyes do not count).

Hallway of Cells~
   Surrounded by metal-barred cells this room leads directly into 
where the dangerous criminals too violent to be put in the 
general population of the gaol are housed by the Black Watch. A 
pair of torches light this chamber placing a dim light over a 
large table in the room, likely for the jailers to relax or 
gamble at while they are on duty. Solid iron shackles hang from 
the north wall to hold in place any prisoner who was foolish 
enough to earn the jailers ire. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling, 
and an odd dripping sound echoes about the room like clock work 
every few minutes.

   This crude, unlit storage closet is very tightly packed with

filling the lungs of any who enter. Sized to only allow a few 
people access at once, the ceiling is short, and makes taller 
occupants feel the need to duck without hitting their heads upon 
the ceiling. Dark-gray brick walls surround this closet turning 
it into a shadowy, and unwelcome trap even when lit.

in color and show many etchings and symbols, numbers being the 
most common as prisoners attempted to keep track of the number of 
days they had been held. Rusty shackles hang from the walls at 
the back of this cell for those prisoners who tend to cause too 
much trouble. A small puddle of water has begun to well up in 
the back of this cell, while not enough to drink from it makes 
the cell floor quite damp.

   This cell is somewhat comfortable, with a few pieces of 
furniture and a tattered woolen rug draped across the hard stones 
of the floor. A lamp swings gently from the ceiling, lightning 
the black stone, and the western door is of solid wood reinforced 
with iron. A little grille sits in the top of the door, granting 
one a view of the bleak gaolhouse hall, and through it filters 
the gibbers, screams and shouts of the rest of the prison.

   Bland, identically crafted tables line this room taking up 
nearly the whole space enclosed within. Noise seems to echo 
about this room and rebound including the voices and mutterings 
of numerous off duty members of the Black Watch. The room 
itself, while easily large enough to hold fifty men contains 
little to no sign of decoration or embellishment aside from the 
banners lining the walls displaying a mailed fist clutching a 
lightning bolt. 
   A solid granite staircase leads up to an iron-barred door in 
the northern section of the messhall.

A Messy Room Under Refurbishment~
   This spacious, wood walled office has a somewhat relaxed look 
about it. The northern half of this room has been converted into 
a sleeping area. A fireplace sits in one corner of this room
meant to keep it heated at all times of day. Above the fireplace 
hangs a massive, two handed-sword carved of solid ivory. A heavy 
mahogany desk stands towards the center of the room set high to
create it as an intimidating seat of power. A single window 
stands against the west wall, barred in iron to prevent a 
potential break-in, while still allowing a fair amount of light
to breach this chamber.

The Room of Study and Luck~
   If your character is in this room, then their intelligence or 
aura is high enough to have warranted them extra study, 
knowledge, fate, or sheer blind luck, manisfesting itself in the 
option to buy and select options and items not available to the 
average Tur Edendor newbie player. Anything your character 
purchases here, they are assumed to have stumbled across 
it in their travels before coming to the settlement (you'll need 
to make up a backstory behind whatever you find here). 
 
IMPORTANT: Many items for sale here are illegal, either to 
wear, or to even own for the average person in the street. It is 
suggested that you do not walk down the main street showing them 
off as soon as you commence the game, or you could find yourself 
losing these items very quickly. 
 
You can move next to the general newbie shopping area by walking 
north, but you will be unable to return to this room at a later 
date.

Ground Floor of the Flophouse~
   The wooden interior of the flophouse is rather plain, its 
purpose obvious enough; to house the various labourers of Tur 
Edendor that have no other place to sleep at night, and provide 
rooms for rent for any travelers with enough coin in their 
pockets. A wooden counter runs along the northern side of the 
wall, behind it a set of stairs leading both up and down, to the 
attic and basement of this large, breezy building. Pallets of 
straw cover much of the southern side of the room, some of them 
occupied by slumbering figures, others empty. A broad door, a 
series of shutters either side of it, opens out to the east.

A Wide, Dark Underground Tunnel~
   Fairly featureless, this tunnel is dark, angling through the 
solid stone of the mountain as it heads from north to south. The 
ceiling is high enough to walk unobstructed, and the air is hot, 
stuffy, and laden with unpleasant scents. The atmosphere 
thickens to the south, and the darkness almost seems palpable 
there.

In the Western End of a Large Cavern~
   Black and bearing a dull shine, the walls of the cavern have
been polished and marked with hung lanterns at even intervals.
The large space is occupied with a few people, being of any
ethnicity, as well as some shambled tables and chairs. A gentle
breeze moves through the area, heading in under the opening in
the western wall and leading deeper into the cavern eastward.
The floor and ceiling have stumps where mineral growths have
been chiseled away, as well sections of the wall to give this
end of the cavern a square feeling. The floor is natural stone,
ground flat in some places, and covered with hay in most.

In a Large Intersection of Tunnels~
   Somewhat akin to a cavern, this intersection in the grey rock
spawns tunnels to all four cardinal direction. Formed in circles
and sitting with their backs against walls, orkin and humans have
gathered amidst the cavern, whilst others move back and forth in
all directions. Rope crisscrosses the intersection, supporting
lit lanterns that cast vague shadows upon segments of the stone
walls. The sounds of mining reverberate from all around as dust
sporadically falls from the cavern's ceiling. Masked in darkness,
the ceiling's depth is unpenetrated by the light. In the center
of the intersection, a strong breeze rushes upwards towards the
cavern's overhead.

easing the comings and goings of various denizens of varied

the eastern wall has been cut extensively, moving away from the

The End of A Long Sloping Tunnel~
   Directed in a gradual slope, this tunnel travels due east in
a fairly straight line. The walls are unevenly cut, crags and
burs sticking out at various places, giving off a whistling
resonance from the gentle breeze that travels in from up the
slope. The rock walls themselves are black and shine dully in
several spots along the tunnel, cast in the glow of a string of
lanterns hung on beams of timber at regular intervals down the
shaft. Towards the bottom, the walls begin to take on a grey
hue, nearing a short drop down into another shaft. Over the
rounded edge, several stout ladders can be seen.

flophouse. The walls here are of an unmellowed wood, the raw 
surface visible in a few places where the thin coat of white wash 
has not been applied evenly. The majority of the space here is 
taken up by a long wooden staircase that leads down, down, down 
in to the noisy, messy and smelly commons on the rest house, but 
a corridor branches off north past seperate rooms, and a stout 
door is set in the western wall.

Noisy Corridor Through the Flophouse~
   Crudely cut planks of wood make up both the floors and the 
walls all the way down this hallway. The ground shows strong 
signs of wear, muddy boots and other scrape marks have begun to 
deteriorate the recent construction already. Doors are built 
into the halls length, offering rooms for rent in the Inn. The 
hallway is quiet enough that the loud bustle of patrons 
downstairs can be clearly heard, the voices of men with an 
undertone of rasping orcish. There are many marks on the walls 
already where a stray weapon has hit the wood, and even a few 
dark patches that can only be dried crusted blood. Though the 
wood is fresh enough to scent the air, it is mostly oppressed by 
the bustling population downstairs.

   Rooms line the walls of this hallway as the upper floor of the 
Inn provides a place for the inhabitants of the city to rent a 
room. The bustling crowd below can be heard quite clearly 
through the wooden floor, the many voices of men mixing with the 
few grunted sounds of orc and goblin kind. Gritty trails of 
dried mud lead to many of the rooms, the recently constructed 
hallway already sullied by many dirt encrusted feet and boots. 
Scuff marks line the walls and doors in many places, the effects 
of the odd scrape, fight, or perhaps over zealous drunken patron.

Noisy Corridor Through the Flophouse~
   Crudely cut planks of wood make up both the floors and the 
walls all the way down this hallway. The ground shows strong 
signs of wear, muddy boots and other scrape marks have begun to 
deteriorate the recent construction already. Doors are built 
into the halls length, offering rooms for rent in the Inn. The 
hallway is quiet enough that the loud bustle of patrons 
downstairs can be clearly heard, the voices of men with an 
undertone of rasping orcish. There are many marks on the walls 
already where a stray weapon has hit the wood, and even a few 
dark patches that can only be dried crusted blood. Though the 
wood is fresh enough to scent the air, it is mostly oppressed by 
the bustling population downstairs.

White-Washed Wooden Landing~
   This landing spreads from the inwards opening door set in the 
western wall, a plain staircase leading down into a noisome 
flophouse. The walls here are of an unmellowed wood, the raw 
surface visible in a few places where the thin coat of white wash 
has not been applied evenly. The majority of the space here is 
taken up by a long wooden staircase that leads down, down, down 
in to the noisy, messy and smelly commons on the rest house. 
Stout doors are set in the northern, eastern, southern, and 
western doors, and the staircase ends at another door leading in 
to the attic bedroom of the flophouse.

white wash, the floor and ceiling flat and of laid, unmellowed, 
wooden timbers. The southern hall has a passage cut in to it, 
covered by a frayed, red, linen curtain.

Small Prayer Hall Within the Stone Chapel~
   When not completely occupied, a reverent hush fills this small 
prayer hall, any sounds made muted by the thick walls of cut grey 
stone. A single window is set in the eastern wall of the chapel, 
stretching from jut above the broad double-doors to the high 
wooden ceiling. A row of stone blocks has been removed at 
roughly head height, ringing about the chapel, small candles 
placed in the hollow that fills the hall with a dim, flickering 
light. At the western end of the hall, behind a tattered red 
curtain, three doors lead away from the main hall, two located at 
either end of a narrow stone staircase, the other set in the 
western wall itself.

   This dark basement barracks is lit by a single lamp set

laid north to south, and the floor underneath plain wooden

Lackadaisic Kennels and Stables~
   A fair few kennels and stables for wargs and horses line the 
long, twisting corridor that leads deeper and deeper in to the 
dark rock overhead. The stables are predominately at the 
southern end of the structure, where more light and fresh air 
blows through the crude wooden gate, whilst the wargs are 
kenneled in the northern side. Bow-legged goblins, wearing a 
whip-marked patch on their shoulders, range up and down the 
corridor that twists east and west, carrying bags of feed, 
brooms, and fresh straw. The stench of wet fur and horse dung 
hangs heavy in the air.

   A square shaped hollow has been hacked out of the black rock 
of the Ephel Duath, and floor far from even and instead rising 
and falling in some places, the occasional small mesa of stone 
also lurching from the floor. Scraps of bone and meat carpet the 
ground, and rough clumps of furs and linens form goblin and orc 
occupied nests in the warren floor here, the air full of the 
stench of sweat and rotting meat found wherever orkin make their 
home. Three rough doors lead off from the cave, in all 
directions save west.

Boss Caverns~
   The contours and lines of this chamber have a slightly shaky 
feel to them, as if the builders were trying to recapture an 
image rather than dig a cave anew. This chamber appears to have 
been carved recently from the thick, surrounding rock. A heavy 
stench of orc lingers over the place that would offend any 
creature of a daintier taste. Tattered banners bearing poorly 
sewn skulls hang from the walls, while at the back of the room 
stands a dais of sorts, upon which sits a crude throne carved of 
rotting wood. Piled beneath the throne lie human skulls in a 
path leading out of the room, some still fresh with blood, or 
gore that has yet to have been licked away by a passing orc.

the walls of large, neatly cut blocks of white stone, all of them 
bare but the floor laid over with a bed of rushes. A long 
staircase winds its way about the room to lead to the second 
level of the building, and a small door, decorated with elaborate 
carvings of a hunting scene, opens inwards to the store-front to 
the east.

Small Storage Cupboard~
   Numerous shelves here hold all sorts of goods, mostly perfume 
and candles, though a great deal of the shelves are simply blank 
space; the likelihood of one filling all the gaps here is slim to 
none. The walls and floor sandstone, the cupboard is seperated 
from the rest of the building by a thick curtain that lies to the 
south.

Inside a Black Canvas Tent before the Gaolhouse~
   There is a sombre, spartan feel to the interior of this canvas 
tent. No decoration, the sides of the tent are only fitted with 
the odd window flap, fastened at the top by loose wooden pegs and 
rope. The canvas has been bolted into the walls of the gaolhouse 
to the west, open to the double doors that dominate there. At 
all times a one pair of bronze-clad guards stand sentry and the 
double doors to the west, and one pair to the entrance of the 
tent to the east, a clear path down the tent between the two.

Top Floor of the Sandstone Building~
   This circular room is set atop a lower one, a narrow set of 
stairs leading down from the south. From here, a number of stone 
slits that have been cut in to the walls offers a view out across 
Tur Edendor, and the many houses and shanties assembled beneath 
the distant spire of black rocks to the south and east. The 
noises of people passing by underneath rise up and filter through 
the stone windows and the heavy curtains draped over them, along 
with a pleasant floral scent. A narrow set of stone stairs lead 
to an upper door.

Spacious Cavern~
   This oversized cavern appears to be naturally formed with 
smooth rock faces and a vaulted ceiling towards the center. Upon 
closer inspection large areas of the caverns perimeter have been 
scarred with crude tools forming small alcoves housing the 
occasional nest and rock debris some of which rise above the 
floor and up along the slate grey walls. An oversized door of 
what appears to be fire hardened oak, braced with iron lies to 
the north its surface painted with dried blood, forming an empty 
eye-socket of red and black hues. A small door of cedar 
reinforced with scraps of blackened iron is jammed open in the 
southern wall.

   Bits of rotted flesh, bone and fur cling to grim totems

with the putrid smells of must and decay. Along the eastern rock 
face of the cavern, patches of yellow-green fungus cling within a 
naturally formed nook that glistens with moisture from a small 
trickle of brackish water above that flows into a hastily carved 
basin at the bottom of the small nook.

Cluttered Storeroom~
   This modest sized cave has been hewn roughly into the shape of

walls. Despite the rooms size several crates, boxes and racks 
congest the room making it difficult to navigate.

Altar Room~
   This somewhat circular room's walls have been chipped away to 
form its perimeter and ceiling leaving alternating patches of 
rough stone and smooth flaked surfaces. The sickly-sweet 
metallic scent of blood and burnt pungent herbs looms heavily in 
the still air of the cavern. A large stone slab lies in the 
center of the room and is heavily encrusted with varying hues of 
dried blood. About the floor surrounding the slab a empty eye 
socket has been drawn in charcoal, its details only marred by the 
occasional bone fragment. Small alcoves no larger then a bucket 
have been carved into the sides of walls where grim totems of 
skulls, stretched skins and other identifiable objects rest. 
Hitched into the ceiling near the eastern wall a few rusted 
chains with cruel barbs, some still bearing bits of dried flesh, 
dangle. Tucked into the corner in the south a large hammock is 
anchored between the walls with metal hooks a smaller one held in 
the same manner is parallel beside it.

A Dusty Wooden Warehouse~
   This wood-walled building is flush against the stone of the 
mountain, leaving a somewhat rough and stony surface bare to the 
east. The air in here is thick with dust and particles from the 
goods stored here, which occupy crates, barrels, boxes, and bags. 
A thin wooden counter runs along one wall, behind which sits a 
stool and a few shelves with smaller merchandise on them. A 
sturdy set of stairs lead upwards

A Creaky Wooden Shop~
   Completely made of wooden planks, the stone floor of this shop 
gives way to the south as the building hangs over the edge of the 
cliff it is built upon. Beyond, the floor is a series of wooden 
slats, between which can occasionally be seen a sliver of empty 
space. While reinforced so as not to break, the whole 
construction seems rather unsturdy, especially considering the 
bulk of the goods stored here. Crates of foodstuffs, cloth, and 
other essentials line the walls and floors, vying for space in a 
room where there is little to be found.

A Cold Stone Dungeon Lined with Numerous Bunks~
   The thick, blocky walls of this entryhall and barracks have 
been splashed with a dark gray paint. At regular intervals 
around its dank circumference have been placed iron-grated 
torches which crudely sputter ample light over the room, the 
previous windows of the place now boarded and bricked up. A dull 
green and brown mould seems to decorate the ceiling area, the 
spider-web-ridden, rusted chandelier casting light onto it and 
giving a light sheen. Thick chunks of grey stone have been 
roughly hewn into coarse benches and stumpy stools to accommodate 
for the figures which lurk in this dismal hive of activity and a 
number of bunks with moth-eaten linens and drab colours are 
settled in intervals against the walls where bulbous spiders make 
their home. A dripping can be heard faintly in one of the 
corners of this room.

A Stark, Capacious Stone Chamber~
   An expansive pitch black banner slung over the wall adjacent 
the doorway dominates the demeanour of this chamber, etched 
neatly upon it in bronze stitching a jagged lightening bolt. 
Before the foreboding symbol is set a vast desktop, the legs of 
the hardwood furnishing set firmly upon the ground, seeming 
unmovable by any measure of strength. A rusting iron lantern 
hangs from the centre of the ceiling, held within it a near-spent 
stump of candle wax. Massive brass hinges have been hammered 
into the doorframe to support the iron-shod door covering the 
portal, which has recently seemed to undergo some form of repair. 
Before the behemoth desk, a rectangular slab has been delved from 
the stone, in the centre of which a wooden trapdoor has been 
located, constructed of a number of solid wooden boards nailed 
together with two crosspieces, a large iron ring bolted at one 
end, with a lock clasped firmly to loop the ring into a hinged 
bracket bolted to the ground. Beneath the banner is a large 
window, which looks to have recently been covered over with 
bricks. Either side of the depression in the floor have been 
aligned numerous rows of wooden crates and racks designed to 
carry weaponry and armour.

A Bleak, Stone Chamber with a Sarcophagus-like Slab in the Centre~
   This square-cut chamber is lit only by the rusted lantern 
sitting atop the sarcophagus-like table in the centre of the 
room. Hewn evenly and resting with perfect symetry, the stone 
sarcophagus serves as a table for those that already preside 
within the mess hall. The walls are dull and unadorned, save for 
the stains that spill down the wall in various areas, usually 
high up toward the ceiling where moisture has gathered, and a 
darkly-hued algae has begun to collect. The chamber is ghastly 
in appearance, the cold stone walls carrying echoes of voices 
from the square doorway carved into the southern wall. At the 
head of the table rests a monstrous cauldron, the only heat in 
the room radiating from the glowing embers in the coals below the 
cauldron, which has scorched the stone floor below it. A large 
plume of steam bellows up from the bubbling gruel within the pot.

Luxurious Lounge~
   This spacious lounge is an opulent blend of majesty and 
somberness. Occupied chiefly by men and women of Numenorean 
descent, this large establishment is almost never "crowded". A 
silent hush often fills the lounge, which seldom sees more than 
thirty patrons and often fewer than that. Intricate floral 
images are carved upon the cedar doors that separate this area 
from the clamorous market square to the west. Identical arches 
on each wall lead off to the north, east, and south. Tall arched 
windows high on the western wall allow ample light and airflow 
into the room. The granite is cloudy and lends the lounge a 
certain bleakness that is further accentuated by a luscious 
network of rose vines that dominates all the walls except the 
eastern one. A dark, grim mural dominates the upper half of the 
eastern wall. Through the southern arch seems to be an exotic 
looking bathing area.

mural~
The artistry and effort that went into such a production is something to
be admired.  Directly opposite the western doors is the image of a man
who stares forward with a hateful glower.  He is decked in black armor
and stands alone upon a white shore, driving a banner into the ground
with a look of defiance.  Behind him in the violent seas are dozens of
warships of massive proportions, their black masts spanning high into
the fiery skies amidst a terrible lightning-storm. It is a grim depiction,
full of rage and splendor.

single bench runs around the whole length of the room, hugging 
each wall. In the center of the room is a square-shaped marble 
bench with a backrest that could comfortably seat at least a 
dozen people. Steam is always drifting out of the four vents in 
the room, one in each corner, and keeping the air in the sauna 
very humid and hot.

northern wall and the floor about them. The floor has been made 
of tinted pinewood running horizontally with the walls. The 
sweet aroma of meats and scents are ever present and seems to 
have been soaked into the walls and waft in from the southern

particularly cramped but has been set in an attempt to make it 
look more spacious and elaborate than it actually is.

business it serves its purpose. The table having been made a 
cedar wood it has been given a finish of woodstain. The eastern 
door has been bolted with heavy iron to support it, a pad-lock 
has been placed midway in the door?s surface. Having a door set 
upon the west and eastern ways, it gives off a seemingly sealed 
room.

room as been converted into a small kitchen with a series of 
shelves and a counterspace. The three walls making up this room

grain, remnants of paint sticking in places. Covering the pine 
planked flooring are a series of worn, soft old rugs. In the 
northwest corner of the room is a simple, pine stepladder leading 
up to the trapdoor. A rounded window has been placed upon the 
northern wall here, allowing light to enter.

underwarrens of Tur Edendor. The southern door has had a large, 
heavy black-iron lock set on it, roped over with iron chains to 
prevent entry. Few orkin, and even fewer humans, stop here.

Open-Aired Ledge off the Black Slopes of the Mountain~
   This broad ledge juts out from the craggy black slope that 
forms the southern side of the rock-wall of Tur Edendor. Far 
below to the south a circle of jagged rocks can be seen, certain 
to impale anything that falls down upon them. The winds can whip 
viciously through here, but luckily for the safety of those 
gathered there is a chain-linked fence threaded through iron 
posts hammered in to the rock ledge. Cages and iron manacles 
also decorate the area, and a large metal gate covers the eastern 
edge of the mountain, leading back inside. A crude tunnel is cut 
into the mountain, leading northwards.

Nest-Lined Den Inside a Broad Cave~
   The centre of the this den has been kept clear of the mass of 
bug-infested straw pallets and crude nests of furs and linens 
that clutter around the edges. Instead, in the middle, a long, 
broad table sits, covered in bloody marks and scraps of bone and 
entrails that attract insects. The northern wall channels down 
to a stout, scarred oak door that opens inwards, while the 
western wall is covered by a series of dark iron bars that forms 
a crude gate over an opening in the cave, chill air occasionally 
breezing in. A broad stone ramp leads upwards, a path cut open 
into some natural caves in the mountain.

A Long, Narrow Establishment~
   This establishment, carved into the dark stone of Tur 
Edendor's rocky outcrop, has been roughly splashed with drab 
colours of watery paint to barely form its decoration. A few 
decorative cuirasses and etched breastplates have been hung from 
the wall by thick, jutting nails. The long room is noticeably 
thin, stretching from the southern door to the north where the 
counter lies. Accounting for the clutter of shelves, racks and 
armoires set against the eastern and western walls, two broad 
humanoids could walk abreast through the room. A few 
spluttering, iron-grated torches have been firmly pushed into 
small alcoves of the dark, web-covered walls to cast forth ample 
orange and red light which glimmers from the armour wares within.

   This workshop is clutter of various tools and equipment. This 
long, rectangular room has been roughly hewn from the dark stone 
of the surrounding outcrops of Tur Edendor, its walls splashed 
with drab coloured paints in a meager form of decoration. 
Workbenches line the edges of the room, running also down the 
centre. On top sit a vast array of tools, nails, scrap wood and 
metal shavings as well as quenches, boxes, shelves and cupboards 
though clearly, they are already over-filled telling by the 
objects strewn on the workbenches. A few spluttering torches sit 
in intervals about the room in poorly carved alcoves to cast

home to Tur Edendor. The walls have been splashed with drab 
coloured paints for minimal decoration though a few grim, poorly 
painted pictures have been hung to the walls, displaying sets of 
darkened mail and exotic suits of leather Small doors lie to the 
south and east of the rounded room and iron-grated torches have

Inside A Tent Of Heavy, Oiled Leather~
   Dim and smelling of oiled leather, this tent is supported by a 
wooden frame. The hides used to make the tent have been stitched 
together with thick sinew, leaving slight cracks here and there 
where light shines through during the day. A few crude racks and 
pegs are set along the supports to hold goods, and a few planks 
of thin wood are set up to act as a counter in one corner. A 
flap in the tent leads out to the market, and the northern 
portion of the tent has been separated from the rest, the wooden 
framework there set with a small door.

A Spacious Common Room~
   Formed of gently curving wood, the walls of this room have 
been covered with a simple, yet beautiful mural of a desert 
night, the pale golden stretching along the lower half in obscure 
dunes. The upper half of the walls bears a gradually darkening 
blue tone until it fades again into speckling white starbursts, 
all culminating to a full, round moon on the ceiling, from which 
a hanging brazier casts its light. A star-carved shutter covers 
the window that looks out into the street. Except for one corner 
of the room reserved as the kitchen area, it is devoid of 
clutter, leaving ample of space for movement. 
   A compact, spiraling staircase leads up into the second floor, 
its solid banister painted a dusty, grey-blue to appear like a 
stylized whirlwind. A heavy silk curtain of cerulean blue hangs 
in the eastern doorway. And a wide, arching doorway opens into 
an adjoining workroom to the south.

   While not large this room boasts a comfortable area to live

stone floor is cold but is strewn with colorful rag rugs to add

Inside A Tent Of Black Leather~
   This poorly lit tent reeks of oiled leather, human and orkish 
sweat and is awash with tiny, rapid-moving flies that constantly 
buzz in and out through the western flap. The tent itself is 
well constructed with ash framework supporting the thick black 
leather that looms above, allowing very little light inside, only 
two strategically punctured holes in the roof providing adequate 
light. When heavy rain pours down, customers are often found 
avoiding the dripping water, crude buckets usually set below. A 
basic counter of damp, slightly rotted wood separates the public 
part of the tent in two, the only way to access the eastern part 
being, besides jumping over it, a roughly cut hole at the 
counters end, barely big enough for a man to squeeze his way 
through. Behind this counter a large frame of wood prevents 
further progress, basic shelves and racks displaying the tents 
goods. In the center of this simple wall is a small, egg-shaped 
door, slightly smaller than the average goblin.

The Backroom of a Tent of Black Leather~
   Excluding the tiny streams of light that sometimes force their 
way through the western doors edges, this backroom is in constant 
darkness unless lit artificially. It is simple and small and 
constructed in a functional manner, the ash framework being 
constructed to maximise the capacity of the area. The air here 
is extremely heavy and a leathery smell mixed with sweat makes 
its home here permanently. A crude wall prevents access to the 
west with a small, egg-shaped door in its center.

A Large, Noisy Cavern~
   This cavern is large and has extremely high ceilings, making 
echoes commonplace if not muted by the straw and dirt strewn 
across the ground. Against the north-eastern wall a number of 
straw dummies are set up, targets painted on their form. The 
north western corner appears to have been devoted to the training 
of the mounts whilst the southwestern one is set up with 
equipment suited for melee training. The air is thick with the 
smell of the animals, the occasional whicker and snarl hearable. 
Each side of the room has an iron barred door leading into 
another cave, the walls lined with sputtering torches casting 
their dim light over the room. A corner in the east slopes down 
and gives way to an iron gate, a smaller door to the north barely 
notable behind the various dummies.

A Wide, Straw-Strewn Entryway~
   The southern entrance to this cavern, which has been cut out 
of the surrounding rock, is wide and possesses high ceilings. A 
pair of stout, double doors are set into the northern wall, 
banded with iron with a single roaring flame engraved roughly in 
the middle. Shelves have been cut behind the counter and have 
been stocked with tangled leather bridles, folded up blankets of 
burlap, crudely-fashioned saddles and piles of barding-- and on 
the counter itself, stick-figure representations of wargs and 
other beasts have been engraved on the stone, and prices etched 
beneath them, scratched out and rewritten many times. Yrkin and 
mongrels clad in leather and metal are seen here at all times, 
yet curiously half-men appear to be the most common sight.

by a series of iron-barred cages. The stone walls have been 
marred with countless of scratches and marks, a few cured hides 
hanging from the side and painted with red flames. A single 
lantern of beaten iron hangs from the ceiling, illuminating the 
hall. To the north, at the end of the hall, a wide stone cavern 
with high ceilings can be glimpsed, to the south a pair of stout 
double doors lead back out to the stone-hacked warrens of Tur 
Edendor.

   This small stone closet has been connected to the rest of the 
kennels by way of a thick, squat oaken door. Shelves and racks, 
cupboards and crates cramp what space there is, leaving little 
room for one person, let alone several, and the ceiling is 
exceptionally low. Despite this, however, the room itself is dry 
and cool, reasonably free from mildew or mold, and nearly 
odorless save for the stink of wet warg fur filtering in from 
under the southern door.

construct, have been spaced equally from one another in the 
central of the cave, piles of soiled straw and muddy dirt heaped 
near them, alongside mounds of fresher bedding.

to hold well over a dozen people, the odd straw hinting at the

covered in a layer of ashes and soot, the result of the large 
forge and other smithy equipment. A solid looking iron pipe runs

smoke somewhere outside.

A Small Butcher's Store~
   This two storey wooden building connects with the street here, 
through a small shopfront containing many racks of butchered meat 
of various sorts. The floor is floor is not particularly tidy, 
being covered in all kinds of unidentifiable fluids, stomped 
through by many boots. The metal racks hang from the roof, and 
there are also trays, angled to display the wares and stoppered 
at the bottom to prevent them sliding off. At the far end of the 
store is a short wooden counter, and there is a door beside it. 
This room has a rather strong smell to it, not unpleasant, but 
still one that would overwhelm most people if they spent a lot of 
time here. There is a doorless entry way to the east of the room 
with a small red and white striped pole hanging above it.

A Musty Smelling Storefront~
   This room leads from the shopfront to the west, and is not 
particularly large. The floor is tiled, and the astute viewer 
would notice it slopes very slightly towards the northwest corner 
of the room, where a small drain can be seen. There is a wide 
window that looks out to the street on the north wall, which has 
a fairly secure wooden curtain that can drawn across it. The 
walls here are largely unadorned, however there is a glass mirror 
across the eastern wall, at approximately the height of a seated 
man's head. Various shelves look to have been recent additions 
to the room, and hold leather wares: armor, sheathes, boots, 
belts and other miscellany.

   What would usually be several rooms has been combined into one 
open-plan room on the second story of this wooden building. One 
corner of the room is clearly set aside for living and sleeping, 
another for working, another for food preparation. There is a 
window to the outside street, and a door on the opposite end. It 
is fairly sparsely furnished, although in fairly good condition,

A Dank, Poorly Lit Storefront~
   The rough unpainted timber walls of this storefront are lined 
with wooden shelves, with several more positioned about the 
interior. Arranged across these shelves is an assortment of 
oddities, and other goods. The store itself is smallish, with no 
wall running more then several strides of the average man. 
Lacking any windows, a meager trio of lanterns hang from the 
ceiling casting a low flickering light with which to view the 
goods for sell. The poor ventilation of this building results in 
a smoky haze, and a rather pugnant but unidentifiable smell.

A Small, Barren Storeroom~
   Lacking any internal source of light, this small storeroom is 
purely functional in nature. Several crates are stacked along 
side the shelved walls, providing plenty of space to store unsold 
goods. The unsanded walls of rough lumber give this space an

A Fenced Commons Situated Before a Steep Incline~
   Roughly oval in shape this common area takes advantage of a 
concave in the rocky raise on its northern edge. Several large 
rocks line the northern edge below the raise, a rather quaint 
storefront sits to the west while the smell and sounds of 
livestock waft in from the eastern end of the space. The worn 
smooth ground of rock implies a steady flow of traffic through 
the area. A rusty, iron fence and gate enclose the area, clearly 
more tailored to keeping in animals then protecting from 
intruders.

A Pugnant, Functionally Designed Stables~
   Long and narrow, this private stable houses five stalls along 
each side of its walkway. At the far end, past the stalls, sits 
a sizable alcove within which a stock of fodder and bedding is 
haphazardly stored. Set aside in the storage space is a set of 
rickety, wooden stairs which climb up to a solid oaken trapdoor. 
The interior of each stall is easily viewed through individual 
iron-barred windows, proving each is of adequate size and 
conditions for most varieties of mounts. The smell is unpleasant 
a mix of urine, feces and mold.

A Barely Visable Trail Up a Steep Incline~
   With no true boundaries or markers, this climb up onto the 
plateau is little more then a series of scalable rocks. Only 
occasionally does a sharp cutback, or stretch of rough trail 
appear along the rugged cliff face. Not for the clumsy or 
encumbered this route of travel quickly weaves its way up to the 
slums of Shantytown visible on the plateau's edge above.

A Modest, Underground Chamber Lit by Candles~
   At the bottom of the crude stairwell here opens out a rather 
modest chamber roughly hewn from grey rock. Though lit by a 
number of dribbling wax candles set in iron grates, corners of 
the usually deadly quiet room are left to the shadows, more often 
than not dirtied. An effort has been made on the ceiling of 
coarse rock to remove the green-brown moss, assumedly gathered 
due to the moist temperature of the air. Measures have, however, 
been taken to make its appearance one of comfort: a few 
comfortable looking chairs sit at the edges of the room around 
low tables, usually strewn with paperwork or food. Furthermore, 
tapestries and crude paintings of battle scenes have been hung 
upon the walls - volleys of arrows, bronze-clad divisions in 
advance, rain muddying the once green surroundings as individuals 
fight ruthlessly for their survival. A corner of the room nearer 
the southern stairwell has been sectioned off for a few bunks.

A Stuffy, Humid Workroom~
   The north, west, and east walls of this room have been adorned 
with a sturdy counter, and several shelves. The southern wall 
being left bare, likely for the doorway found there. The simple 
pinewood floor is littered with traces of dirt, dried plant 
matter, and other refuse from some previous projects. In the 
northeastern corner of the room, a simple iron-shod chimmey drops 
from the ceiling into a stove, allowing smoke an easy escape. 
The functional construct, and undecorated nature of this room 
clearly mark it as one for labor and not leisure.

expansive ghetto. Ramshackle establishments, crafted of rotting 
wood and other poor masonry, houses the grubby individuals - 
humanoids - that wonder these foul parts. The ghetto appears to 
be spreading like an infection westward across a low, natural 
plateau of the Ephel Duath; alleys, like arteries, sprout from 
the more populated areas and lead into darker, shadowed 
residences. Individuals scarper the main streets, lighting 
lanterns set into the walls of houses and shops, amply 
illuminating these parts at sundown.

dirty, ragged-clothed individuals constantly passing by, at night 
seen only in the dim street lighting. A crumbling building rises 
to the south whereas to the west individuals continue to scatter 
on their daily business. Many of the revealed faces of this area 
appear human in descent, complexions more often than not 
malnourished and drawn. Discarded litter and mud have compacted 
here upon this cracked street due to the sheer numbers treading 
its surface. A shabby house constructed of rotting wood and 
stone masonry sits off the road to the south.

loosing a fair number of occupants it before contained at the 
junctions to the east. Shanties and crumbling buildings of 
rotten wood and rubble have been erected either side of this 
twisting street save for the northern direction: a busier square 
opens out, numbers of individuals milling about its expanse. 
Small holes may be viewed in the poor construction of 
individuals' back yards, though they also appear to be just as 
cluttered with rubbish and mud as this main street, lit only by 
wall lanterns.

   This road which snakes through decrepit housing is compact 
with various refuse - litter and mud, most predominantly. When 
rain soaks this already miserable environment, large puddles cut 
across the roadway making access difficult for those dirty 
individuals that skulk about the area. A number of pungent

muddy puddles against the crumbling walls of wood and crumbling

around wagon wheels and slabs that serve as furniture, sometimes 
indulging in an assortment of games from cards to dice and even 
those requiring knives. Smashed glass and rotting farm produce 
lay strewn about this square. Small, deadly quiet alleys subtly 
creep off in some directions toward more collapsed buildings. A

squeeze between two ramshackle buildings to escape to the rest of 
the human shanty town. Puddles usually dampen the area, 
individuals splashing them around as they move about their daily 
business in this humanoid populated area. A smoky, sooty pallor 
hangs in the air, as do pungent smells of faeces, urine and other 
foul resemblances. Numerous buildings crafted of rotting wood or 
crumbling stone - their exterior coated in a damp left by the

containers which have been thrust into the street walls with 
thick nails. The alleys here become narrower, their condition

leaving muddy puddles to collect in small craters. A number of

in this area, leaving only shells of what used to remain where 
the odd urchin might be spied rummaging through forgotten

help~
vstr This street corner is ripe for setting up a local to sell khaskhas that you supply him with. When the street corner is occupied by someone, the dealer will sell 40 coins worth of khaskhas every 2 RL weeks, and give you 60 coins in return. The following commands can be used here: 
vbr -
vstr #6supply drugs#0: If you have the correct token, indicating you're the supplier or a friend thereof the street dealer has agreed to work with, have a crate of khaskhas, and there is a dealer on the corner who's currently looking for more khaskhas, then typing this will buy the crate of khaskhas from you for 60 coins, give you a token to indicate you're the correct supplier for next time, and tell you to come back in 2 RL weeks with more khaskhas.
vbr -
vstr #6wipeout street-dealer#0: If you want to kill the current street dealer here, and potentinally install your own, typing this will load allow you to try and kill the street dealer and his henchmen. After typing this, you will have 30 minutes to kill the NPCs that are loaded up, after which you can type...
vbr -
vstr #6clear street-corner#0: This command will only work after the previous has been typed, and the street dealer has been killed. Typing it will remove all the ownership flags, and leave the street corner with the corpse of the previous street dealer, which will last there for 7 RL days before the street becomes empty again.
vbr -
vstr #6claim street-corner#0: If you have a crate of khaskhas, and the street corner is free of a dealer either dead or alive, typing this will take your crate of khaskhas and put a street dealer loyal to you on the street corner. The first crate will have to be delivered free of charge in order to buy the man's loyalty, but all future crates will be bought for 150 coins.
vbr -
vstr If no one supplies a drug dealer for four weeks, he will abandon the street corner, allowing someone else to claim the street-corner. If you have a token, but the drugdealer is not accepting it, then someone has likely stolen the dealer away from you and you have an outdated token.

Inside a Damp, Rotten Wood Shanty~
   This wood shanty shows recent signs of inhabitants telling by 
piles of flea-ridden clothing and pieces of rotting food. Light 
only filters through a shattered window in the west of this 
establishment during the daytime - where the cluttered street can 
be seen - otherwise, occupants are left in the dark with only the 
sounds of scurrying creatures going to and from their homes 
unless sufficient light is self-provided. The hum of the road 
can be heard through the door to the north quite easily in that 
its form has been heavily splintered, leaving thick chunks on the 
hinges whilst the rest lies strewn about this filthy hovel.

A Battered Alley Through Ramshackle Housing~
   The road to the east thins significantly, eventually forming 
this cracked alley that lies underfoot, snaking between battered 
housing of wood and crude masonry. People lurk in the shadows 
here, any form of lighting now destroyed either in vandalism or 
simply the poor care that is taken to restore anything here. 
Small creatures may be spotted in torchlight scampering across 
the road to their holes and through muddy, refuse-strewn puddles 
and rotten food.

scamper constantly about the area, mingling, impartial with the 
other inhabitants of these slums. Puddles of mud and excrement 
have accumulated at the foot of the housing in small craters and 
cracks in the road's poor construction. A tall, skew building

wood line this alleyway. Some twisted and collapsing, others 
more upright, these houses seem squeezed for space, their forms 
in fact decidedly thin. Most stand at one story - those with two 
appearing to be the ones that are curiously slanted in composure. 
In most places along this alley, dark spires of rock rise up in 
the distance - the Ephel Duath range of Tur Edendor. Closer at 
hand, the odd corpse of a mottled animal, dog, cat or rat, lies 
limp and kicked to the side of the road in a muddied puddle of 
this cracked, crumbling alley. 
   A tavern lies to the south and the alleys continue to bend 
west and north through the slums here.

The Albino Rat Bar~
   No more than a handful of individuals usually congregate in 
this somewhat filthy hive of activity and putrid smells seep in 
through cracks in the door and windows to infuse with any 
remnants of cooking in the air. The floor space of this 
establishment seems to be somewhat broad, spanning quite 
significantly in size. Sections of this squared room are 
sometimes left entirely emptied of activity, instead it finds its 
place in one particular spot at a circle of chairs or around a 
table as drawn and malnourished characters socialise - the odd 
laugh or sneer piercing the damp, stale air. Uneven planks of 
rotting, clammy wood compose the floor and drab linens have been 
hung around the walls in a pathetic attempt at decoration. A 
crude stage of sorts has been situated in the western corner of 
the room near a succession of small cloudy-glassed windows that 
sit in the walls of this tavern and a set of worn stairs can be 
seen piercing the floor behind a small bar of marred wood in the 
eastern reaches of the room.

of this crumbling alley that runs the humanoid sector here. 
Refuse lines the street, collecting in heaps against the 
crumbling walls of wood and stone and individuals are sometimes 
seen at sundown lighting lanterns affixed to walls though 
evidently, many are broken. The hovels here are evidently 
self-built, some more crudely twisted and collapsing than others; 
many, now deserted, houses have lost entire walls, leaving their 
interior exposed to the elements.

a fence blocking entry to the south.

boarded housing; lower shanties, likened more to sheds, are 
sprawled haphazardly along its edges and other collapsed, 
crumbling buildings filling the gaps giving this sector an 
excessively cramped feeling. Heaps of refuse quickly accumulate 
against the housing walls and in the alley's cracks and potholes 
and there has clearly been no effort to rid the place of rotting 
animal corpses.

the lower sets of crude housing. Heavily slanted in places, the

entirely collapsed, leaving nothing more than a wooden shell 
which consumes its previous contents. Space is an issue here 
along the alley and smaller establishments are squeezed between 
the larger, two-story ones in an attempt to grab at living space. 
Malnourished individuals frequently pass by and the pungent smell 
of rotting food and excrement often wafts through the stale 
alleys here.

filth, presumably a mixture of mud, litter and excretion of

alleys lead between them into the darkness of this humanoid 
ghetto. The hovels that have been established tend to be 
somewhat low, none reaching more than one or two storeys high to 
allow a view over some other dark, unlit sections of the ghetto. 
   The amount of litter and garbage in this alley seems to have 
accumulated even more so than the surrounding alleys and streets.

A Widening Alley Stretching Behind a Stinking Garbage Heap~
   This alley, though broadening slightly, bends southward around 
what appears to be a towering junk pile. The smell is simply 
overpowering. The very base of the stinking heap comes up to the 
very edge of the alley, much of it having been kicked and strewn 
over its surface, finding itself betwixt the gaps in hovels or in 
small fissures in the compact stone. The lighting here seems to 
be somewhat more efficient, hinting that the populace of this 
area is perhaps more active. 
   The heap sags in a large bulge around the area, spreading some 
distance in every direction. Trinkets, tattered clothing, sword 
hilts, wood structures, rotting food and lifeless faces of dogs 
and cats jut out from the inanimate mass which dominates the 
surroundings here.

   The cracked, crumbling alley here seems to widen, though at a 
cost: a stinking junk heap riddled with flies, rats and other 
vermin sits in an enormous, sagging pile to the south and west, 
expanding out in all directions. A vast number of objects can be 
seen upon closer inspection, much of the heap falling to within 
inches of the alley as if threatening to block it off entirely. 
   The alley continues westward here, snaking past the heap of 
filth - lifeless faces often seen poking through material - 
hovels and other poor-quality housing crafted of rotting wood 
line its northern edge.

   The cracked, crumbling alley here seems to widen, though at a 
cost: a stinking junk heap riddled with flies, rats and other 
vermin sits in an enormous, sagging pile to the south and west, 
expanding out in all directions. A vast number of objects can be 
seen upon closer inspection, much of the heap falling to within 
inches of the alley as if threatening to block it off entirely. 
   The alley continues westward here, snaking past the heap of 
filth - lifeless faces often seen poking through material - 
hovels and other poor-quality housing crafted of rotting wood 
line its northern edge; numbers of torch-grates have been lit up 
along the road, casting dismal lighting over the dark alleys at 
this time of night, pieces of the debris of the heap lighting up 
in the shadow.

A Squashed Passage Through Derelict Housing~
   Tall, jagged spires rise up in the distance, poking out over 
the lower sets of crude housing. Heavily slanted in places, the 
hovels have been very poorly constructed; sections have almost 
entirely collapsed, leaving nothing more than a wooden shell 
which consumes its previous contents. Space is an issue here 
along the alley and smaller establishments are squeezed between 
the larger, two-storey ones in an attempt to grab at living 
space. Malnourished individuals frequently pass by and the 
pungent smell of rotting food and excrement often wafts through 
the stale alleys here. 
   A crude boardwalk of rickety wood begins its trail steeply 
upwards, eventually disappearing into the junk pile some distance 
up.

A Rickety Boardwalk Affixed to a Stinking Junk Heap~
   On a gentle upward slope, this boardwalk has been fixed to the 
mass of stinking garbage by crude, supports. Though rickety and 
creaky underfoot, it seems to be sufficiently anchored to the 
mess. Continuing one's ascent, a wider view of the humanoid 
sector can be viewed eastward; dilapidated housing and people, 
like ants, weave through the tangle of thin alleys. A vast 
mixture of objects can be seen though much is unidentifiable due 
to its compaction from the pile's upper layers. 
   The boardwalk snakes on a steady descent southwards and an 
steeper curve to the north.

High on a Levelling Boardwalk Around a Stinking Heap~
   As one climbs even higher along this rickety boardwalk, still 
more of the shanty town below comes visible and even parts of 
upper Tur Edendor. This boardwalk has been fashioned from crude 
materials and is shaky underfoot though reasonably affixed to the 
junk heap which it circumnavigates. Levelling somewhat, the 
gangway comes to a straight platform which runs on for a 
significant amount of paces and a couple of gaping holes now 
become visible in the heap's side; makeshift doorways have been 
erected and sandwiched in the face of these entryways crafted 
through the compact garbage from numerous levels above. 
   The number of people along this boardwalk seems to increase 
slightly on one's continued ascent.

Inside a Compact, Supported Shaft Piercing the Rubbish Heap~
   A thick shaft has been hewn from the compact litter of this 
junk pile, appearing to be quite reasonable in size - enough for 
the average humanoid to stand. Shabby wooden supports have been 
laid against the walls of this shaft as a precaution and loose 
pieces of garbage hang from the ceiling and line the way 
underfoot. A putrid smell lingers in the stale air here, 
especially as one ventures deeper into the roughly dug tunnel. 
   A few iron grates have been thrust into natural alcoves of 
these compact walls to serve as lighting when one may take the 
effort to ignite them.

Through a Stinking Shaft, Deeper in the Junk Heap~
   This thick shaft has been roughly hewn from the compact junk 
of this stinking heap and crude wooden supports hold it 
reasonably steady from collapse. At various intervals it wavers 
slightly on its path, never keeping a steady course - a sign of 
truly poor engineering in this case. Underfoot, the garbage has 
been even more compact by the number of inhabitants which pass 
through this area daily; enough for two abreast at least. Vermin 
constantly pick at rotting pieces in the walls and scurry back to 
the small homes which they've made at their base. 
   The tunnel slopes downward to the west as it continues and 
upward slightly to the east. Small alcoves for wall-lighting 
have been cut into the junk walls.

At an Intersection of Tunnels~
   A number of these crudely hewn tunnels converge here as an 
intersection and the quantity of people seems to increase 
significantly. Rats and other vermin, clearly taming somewhat, 
continuously pick at pieces of the compact junk-wall and scurry 
back to their niches. Loose objects seem to litter the floor, 
not yet consumed by the very substance of this garbage heap which 
emits a foul odour that seems to drift through the network of 
tunnels. 
   A few broken furnishings have been set against the walls to 
provide a resting place, onlookers often taking their place to 
watch the hubbub of these tunnels.

Through a Crude Tunnel of Junk Sloping Upwards~
   This particular shaft continues its journey, easing through 
the stinking heap if junk like a worm's tunnel in the earth. The 
stench of litter and refuse is overpowering as one goes about 
their business; pieces of rotting food and excrement undoubtedly 
add to this. Broken furniture, old clothing, rubble and other 
material has been solidly compacted, allowing passage through 
this heap to be possible, though the wooden supports against the 
walls' edges seem to be somewhat contributory also. 
   The slope continues upward, deeper into the heart of the junk 
heap and an intersection lies beyond a twist in the tunnel to the 
south.

A Stinking Tunnel on a Steep Incline~
   The stinking shaft climbs more steeply into the heart of this 
junk heap which has become reasonably compact from the weight of 
the layers above. The number of people passing by seems to be 
somewhat increased as one continues their ascent of this roughly 
hewn tunnel. Vermin pick at loose pieces in the walls - rotting 
foodstuffs, farm produce and excrement seem through some larger 
fissures in the heap where the creatures tend to find their 
dwellings. 
   Dripping can be heard echoing through the tunnels in this 
area. The tunnel here makes inclines steeply upward.

Through a Crudely Hewn Tunnel Snaking East to North~
   Presumably somewhere near the heart of this stinking mass, the 
shaft here eases east and north though one cannot see much beyond 
ten or so paces considering the poor methods used to craft this 
tunnel through old junk, and rotting food. That said, it is more 
evident that the shaft seems to be relatively levelled. An 
uncanny amount of vermin constantly pick at loose pieces which 
have fallen like leaves to the compacted floor which shows much 
more use than many tunnelled sections of this heap. 
   A stinking liquid usually drips from the tunnel's ceiling here 
and a loud murmur can usually be heard somewhere to the north.

Before a Large Hollow in the Compact Wall of Junk~
   Two shafts of roughly hewn litter converge here, meeting at a 
levelling platform before a large, wide hollowed entryway in the 
northern wall of the stinking mass. Loud murmurs tend to be 
heard, current residents of this junk pile moving somewhat 
frequently through its entrance. Little effort has gone into 
creating a welcoming feel to the exterior of this watering hole 
and, instead, has a somewhat worn-in, seasoned feel about it, 
perhaps by the folk there that seem more at ease.

A Jagged Alley Through Cramped Shanties~
   The alley twists abruptly here in a crude knot, passing 
through cramped, decrepit housing. A ghastly stench wafts 
through the area, presumably the towering junk of filth located 
over a thin line of shanties to the north. Visible upon its 
sides seem to be crudely constructed boardwalks which climb the 
junk pile, a few individuals seen walking their surface and even 
disappearing into mass itself. 
   This thin alley is littered itself with various pieces of 
garbage and twists northward through more housing. It also leads 
to the east and south through tumbled down buildings.

A Small Garden~
   This small garden offers a calm respite from the hustle and 
bustle of the city, high stone walls blocking out the noise and 
sights on all sides but the southern, where the tall wall of the 
tavern resides. A variety of plants circle a crushed stone 
walkway which terminates in a small, simple fountain, surrounded 
by a pair of benches. Rows of turned earth lay bare, awaiting 
further planting. The only exit from this sanctuary is a 
nondescript, wooden door to the south.

The "Oasis" Lounge~
   Crowded with luxurious furs, blankets and decoration, this 
large room boasts a series of low tables and cushions, set in a 
semi-circle about a large, darkly-stained stage. A small bar 
curves against the northern wall beside a nondescript doorway and 
a small, ornate statue sits before the western entrance; a 
scantily clad woman pouring water from between carven stone 
hands, the steady stream flowing into the circular pool set 
before her. The air is hazy with many breeds of mixed smoke, 
swirling upwards about a gently spinning chandelier and the 
gentle murmur of conversation is ever-present amongst the many 
diverse patrons.

A Narrow Hallway~
   The floor of this hallway is covered with several rugs and 
exotic furs. To the south, a doorway opens out to a dimly-lit 
room, from which comes a calming, smoky aroma. There are 
doorways to the east and west of dark, glossy wood, and an 
iron-reinforced door to the north. A painting on the eastern 
wall depicts a tall, mahogany-skinned man wearing a sand-hued 
cloak whipping around his ankles whilst standing amidst a desert 
landscape. An iron staircase spirals up to a second floor door.

An Elegantly Decorated Bedroom~
   The walls of this small bedroom are painted a deep crimson, 
and are thick enough to largely block out the noise of the

set across from the doorway while a diaphanous red silken curtain 
divides the chamber in half, the door and window on one side and 
the bed and a large fireplace on the other. A pair of incense

The "Junk Pile" Bar~
   A large hollow has been carved in the southern wall to allow 
entry to this stale-aired, stinking cavern of debris and litter. 
The litter has been compacted by the weight of layers above, 
though sometimes pieces of rotting food can be seen in the mass 
of it. A number of rickety furnishings, crafted apparently from 
loose objects such as planks and rubble, are scattered around 
this circular room, a number of ill-favoured humanoids their 
usual occupants. A moldy carpet of sickly green lies on the 
floor, clearly salvaged from some trash-heap -- in places it is 
jaggedly cut to fit flush against the base of the filthy walls, 
and it is torn in many places. 
   A crude, notched bar sits against the northern wall and a 
small opening has been hewn into the floor near the door, crude 
steps cut from the rock leading down.

A Cramped Alleyway Snaking South and West Through Hovels~
   Ramshackle hovels, most evidently self-crafted, of rotting 
wood line this alleyway. Some twisted and collapsing, others 
more upright, these houses seem squeezed for space, their forms 
in fact decidedly thin. Most stand at one story - those with two 
appearing to be the ones that are curiously slanted in composure. 
In most places along this alley, dark spires of rock rise up in 
the distance - the Ephel Duath range of Tur Edendor. Closer at 
hand, the odd corpse of a mottled animal, dog, cat or rat, lies 
limp and kicked to the side of the road in a muddied puddle of 
this cracked, crumbling alley. 
   The alley bends south and westward here, a large heap of junk 
apparant over ramshackle housing to the north and east.

Junk Passage Winding North to West~
   A thick shaft has been hewn from the compact litter of this 
junk pile, appearing to be quite reasonable in size - enough for 
the average humanoid to stand. Shabby wooden supports have been 
laid against the walls of this shaft as a precaution and loose 
pieces of garbage hang from the ceiling and line the way 
underfoot. A putrid smell lingers in the stale air here, 
especially as one ventures deeper into the roughly dug tunnel. 
   The winding passge winds north and west here, individuals 
frequenting the area.

A Wide Cavern in this Stinking Junk Heap~
   The passage here meets a dead end, at least, at floor level. 
This crudely hewn tunnel widens significantly here; evidently 
attempts have been made to expand this room as large chunks have 
been roughly cut from the ceiling. Vermin constantly infest the 
area, chewing and ripping pieces from the junk walls of rotting 
farm produce and other vile substances. A number of small 
alcoves have also been pressed into the walls, serving in some 
places as storage units and shelves for a wide variety of 
objects, in some cases. 
   A low hollow in a western wall has been fitted with wood, 
apparently salvaged and crafted from the junk into a door; 
another passage slopes gently downwards here.

Within a Dome-Shaped Cavern Hewn from Compact Junk~
   Entrance through a small hollow in the eastern wall, passing 
through a brief narrow hallway, this room opens out significantly 
into dome shape, the ceiling cratered after the building effort 
in here. A wide variety of garbage pokes through the junk walls 
including rotten food and old furniture, though no attempt has 
been made to get at it. Mouldy carpets multi-pattern the 
levelled floor and a few drab linens have been hung at various 
intervals around the walls, all giving the place a slightly more 
comfortable feel for those types that chose to make their 
dwelling here. A number of items have been used to craft 
furniture and a set of moth-eaten armchairs sits in the centre of 
the cavern around a notched, low table.

A Cramped Intersection of Passages~
   A number of tunnels carved from this stinking heap come to a 
head here at an intersection though little room is left for those 
to pass by one another on the straight section of this landing of 
sorts. Pieces of garbage and junk jut through the refuse-lined 
wall, foul liquids dripping into small puddles on the floor which 
soon soak through and continue their path through the heavy mass 
of rubbish. Rats constantly pick at pieces in the walls, mostly 
unfrightened by and human presence. 
   Two opposing paths slope up, to the north, and down, to the 
south and a passage to the west runs fairly straight-cut.

Roughly Cleaven Passage Heading East and West~
   Presumably somewhere near the heart of this stinking mass, the
shaft here eases east and west though one cannot see much beyond
ten or so paces considering the poor methods used to craft this
tunnel through old junk, and rotting food. That said, it is more
evident that the shaft seems to be relatively leveled. An
uncanny amount of vermin constantly pick at loose pieces which
have fallen like leaves to the compacted floor which shows much
more use than many tunneled sections of this heap.
   Pieces of the walls here are more crumbly than elsewhere,
sections caving in.

ceilings of this passage, leaving puddles to soak through the

   There is little space for even one person to walk through this 
alley, squashed against collapsing hovels and a poorly 
constructed wooden scaffold that has been rather plainly 
fashioned into stairs though the structure looks decidedly 
wobbly. A fair amount of people can usually be seen traversing 
this cracked, crumbling alley as it continues to weave and knot 
through derelict housing and other collapsed shantys. A potent 
stench wafts through the area, drawing rats and feral-looking 
animals to the stinking heap's edge.

At the Bottom of a Roughly-Hacked Stairwell~
   This thick shaft has been roughly hewn from the compact junk 
of this stinking heap and crude wooden supports hold it 
reasonably steady from collapse. At various intervals it wavers 
slightly on its path, never keeping a steady course - a sign of 
truly poor engineering in this case. Underfoot, the garbage has 
been even more compact by the number of inhabitants which pass 
through this area daily; enough for two abreast at least. Vermin 
constantly pick at rotting pieces in the walls and scurry back to 
the small homes which they've made at their base. 
   An attempt here has been made to hack a stairway into the 
steadily ascending slope.

   The edges of this cracked street accumulate with a stinking 
filth, presumably a mixture of mud, litter and excretion of 
sorts. Crumbling buildings line either side and minute, tiny 
alleys lead between them into the darkness of this humanoid 
ghetto. The hovels that have been established tend to be 
somewhat low, none reaching more than one or two storeys high to 
allow a view over some other dark, unlit sections of the ghetto. 
   A vast heap of junk and refuse rises up into the stale air of 
the shanty town to the south east.

   This road which snakes through decrepit housing is compact 
with various refuse - litter and mud, most predominantly. When 
rain soaks this already miserable environment, large puddles cut 
across the roadway making access difficult for those dirty 
individuals that skulk about the area. A number of pungent 
smells permeate these alleys and creatures can be heard 
scampering past into their shaded recesses in the crumbling walls 
of housing. 
   A heap of junk towers to the northeast and a tight, littered 
alley snakes westward.

Crumbling, Litter-Strewn Alley Winding East and West~
   This alley, though broadening slightly, bends north around 
what appears to be a towering junk pile. The smell is simply 
overpowering. The very base of the stinking heap comes up to the 
very edge of the alley, much of it having been kicked and strewn 
over its surface, finding itself betwixt the gaps in hovels or in 
small fissures in the compact stone. The lighting here seems to 
be somewhat more efficient, hinting that the populace of this 
area is perhaps more active.

   Underfoot here, the garbage has been even more compact by the 
number of inhabitants which pass through this area daily; enough 
for two abreast at least. A number of rats constantly filter 
through the area, picking at pieces in the junk walls - not 
unlike a few residents of this garbage hive. Putrid liquids tend 
to drip from the roughly-hacked ceiling, accumulating in small 
puddles on the floor which, in turn, also seep through layers 
below. 
   The passage slopes gently upwards here, twisting as it moves.

Flattening Tunnel Before a Crumbling Hole~
   The stinking shaft climbs more steeply into the heart of this 
junk heap which has become reasonably compact from the weight of 
the layers above. The number of people passing by seems to be 
somewhat increased as one continues their ascent of this roughly 
hewn tunnel. Vermin pick at loose pieces in the walls - rotting 
foodstuffs, farm produce and excrement seem through some larger 
fissures in the heap where the creatures tend to find their 
dwellings. 
   As this passage continues further on its ascent, a gaping hole 
becomes visible in the eastern walls of the heap.

On a Rickety Platform Overlooking the Humanoid Slums~
   Hacked into the western wall of this towering heap of filth 
and junk is a gaping hole to allow passage onto this rickety 
balcony. By use of wooden supports and a jutting tier of junk 
only a few feet below, a rather broad, long platform has been 
successfully crafted, allowing those who filter through this area 
to get a magnificent view over a vast portion of the slums which 
stretch out to the east. Decrepit, derelict housing of rubble 
and wood sprawl out in the stale air of a smoky pallor below; 
cramped, crumbling alleys winding endlessly. 
   One here can get a decent view of the alleys below and their 
occupants.

A Roughly-Hewn Cavern at the Foot of a Ladder~
   A thin hole has been carved into the ceiling above, access 
allowable via a splintered trapdoor and a wood ladder. At the 
base of the ladder, a cavern has been roughly hewn from this 
section of the junk pile, the floor somewhat more compact than 
many other passages considering the amount of people who filter 
through the area. Though apparently a living area of one form or 
another, rats still find their way into the space, picking at 
garbage or rotten food in the walls. A few wooden supports have 
been fixed to the walls, ensuring its safety and a number of 
linens, old clothes, straw-stuffed pillows and other items have 
been laid out across the room serving as probably flea-infested 
bedding. 
   A few pieces of furniture have been spread around the room and 
strange trophies and trinkets have been fixed around the wall for 
measly decoration.

Inside a Circular, Roughly-Hewn Cavern~
   This cavern hewn from the stinking junk pile in which it sits 
at the heart of, is a rough circular shape. Strangely, straw has 
been laid out over the floor, compacting in various places like 
near the bottom of the roughly-carved stair on a passage that 
leads upward. Mud cakes the straw particularly at the feet of a 
number of benches which have been tiered around this entire room 
of about three or four levels, each facing to the centre of this 
cavern. 
   A crude fighting ring has been constructed in the centre of 
the room, its base crafted of stained wood and the borders of 
worn rope.

A Small Locksmiths Shop~
   This small wooden shanty, made from the same salvaged wooden 
materials as the rest of the shanty town, appears to be a 
locksmith shop of some variety - many keys, wax moulds, small 
iron tools, and such can be seen around the place. There is a 
counter in the far end of the shop, with a small workbench. The 
shop is fairly dark, having just one small window, and has a 
strange, unidentifiable odour to it.

If you have the incorrect key, or a keyring, or any other item that potentially has the keyword 'key', or you do not have an item in your other hand, you will lose the ticket, and you will not be able to get a refund.

Inside an Exposed, Decrepit House~
   Both a brand new ceiling and floor have been built onto this 
room, a generous amount of stain used along the floor, giving it 
a clean and polished feel in contrast to the buildings appearance 
from outside. Along the western wall is a crude door set into a 
straight, if not slightly small, doorframe that requires one to 
put a little extra shove or push when opening or closing the 
door. A staircase along the southern wall climbs towards the 
upper floor. It is made of oak and the steps bear the silvery 
blue of hornwood. A simple rail runs along the right side and 
has been painted a dark red.

The Collapsing Sideroom of a House~
   Mismatched pine and oak boards have been used to repair what 
was obviously a poorly constructed room. A few of the original 
rotting boards along the western wall still left in their place. 
The work done, while sturdy, shows little for aesthetics. The 
floor board bare gouges and scratches, and is still raw without 
any wood stain to protect or color them. Overall this room is 
quite spartan, more a workroom then anything else. A crude door 
has been set into a recently repaired doorframe, which is 
slightly smaller, so the door needs a little extra push or pull 
to open and close it.

Second Story of a Collapsing House~
   While crude in its work, this room appears quit sturdy. The 
floorboards are old and a few appear slightly weathered, except 
in the very center of the room where a large square of brand new 
oak and pine has been set in to cover some hole in the past and 
turned dark from wood stain. The roof directly above the wooden 
patch looks new also. Mostly unadorned this room boasts an old 
bear hide hands along the eastern wall, and along the western 
wall amateur, but good, work has been done to paint a mural; It 
is a scene depicting one of any corners amongst the decrepit 
slums, in the scene a battle has recently taken place just as 
dusk settles.

The Exposed Roof of a Dim Shanty~
   Perhaps due to some freak accident, or something more 
sinister, the roof of this large building has been torn off; the 
large wooden support beams reaching to waist height before ending 
in a jagged fistful of large splinters. Scraps of lumber and 
rusted nails cover the floor here, the debris shifting and 
tumbling down at the slightest movement through the area. The 
overview of the slums is clearly visible from this ruined 
structure; decrepit, crumbling shanties lying along shadowed, 
twisting alleyways. 
   A section of collapsed rubble allows path to the small 
enclosure below between forgotten alleys.

A Climbing, Rickety Boardwalk Up the Junk Pile~
   Planks of rickety wood, rotting in places, have been composed 
to form a haphazard boardwalk that snakes around and up this 
stinking heap of filth, litter and junk. Way off to the east, 
through the smoky pallor of this ghetto's air, a number of 
crumbling shanty's, cottages and hovels sprawl out, sketchy 
individuals treading the streets at all hours of the day. A 
crumbling hole opens in the southern wall of this junk heap, 
leading away and climbing steeply away from the boardwalk into a 
fighting pit. 
   The boardwalk continues to slope downwards and to the north 
here, eventually adjoining with a littered alleyway.

A Rickety-Wood Boardwalk Climbing a Stinking Heap of Junk~
   As one climbs even higher along this rickety boardwalk, still 
more of the shanty town below comes visible and even parts of 
upper Tur Edendor. This boardwalk has been fashioned from crude 
materials and is shaky underfoot though reasonably affixed to the 
junk heap which it circumnavigates. Levelling somewhat, the 
gangway comes to a straight platform which runs on for a 
significant amount of paces and a couple of gaping holes now 
become visible in the heap's side; makeshift doorways have been 
erected and sandwiched in the face of these entryways crafted 
through the compact garbage from numerous levels above.

Alley Twisting Through the Mongrel Slums~
   Rodents dart across the narrow span of this twisting alleyway 
freely, searching through the filth and grime that covers the 
packed-earth road, their behaviour curbed only by the occasional 
scarred feline that prowls through the area. Bordering the 
southern edge of the alley is a row of crudely-built huts, 
inhabited by malnutritioned humans, the buildings unpainted and 
offering little but the most rudimentary of accommodations. A 
large wall, constructed of thick wooden logs, rises up to the 
north, far too high for any person to climb unassisted.

   The twisting trail of the alley leads from the west, branching 
off towards the north through the human ghetto yet not before 
swelling to a large dirt square between decrepit cottages. The 
repugnant aroma of human filth assails the nostrils here, wafting 
from the debris scattered randomly throughout the slums. A 
battered, twisted metal lamp rises from the centre of the 
intersection, flickering with a dull light during the night.

Inside an Uneven-Roofed Hut~
   The four walls of this ramshackle hut meet together at odd 
angles, having been constructed from all manner of scrap material 
hastily thrown together. A simple roof of rough tiles sits 
unevenly across the wooden slats, numerous missing pieces 
allowing one a clear view of the sky, likewise allowing the 
elements to enter through the gaps. The floor is nothing but 
smoothed dirt, and a rickety door is set in the eastern wall, 
opening outwards onto a narrow alley.

A stark storeroom~
   This stock room is wood paneled. Fresh wood shelves line the 
walls, providing ample space for stashing away supplies or 
merchandise. Overall, a roomy interior offers more than enough 
area to hold even bulky items. The floor is covered with the 
same wooden panels of the walls, except bearing the obvious marks 
of frequent use. The smell of wood hangs heavy in the air here.

A Comfortable Barracks~
   Rectangular shaped this room is long and wide. A row of bunks 
line one the simple whitewashed walls. One end of the room is 
cleared and a weapons rack dominates the wall. At the far end of 
room near the door is small dining area. The room looks lived 
in. It has clean rushes on the floor and shelves for storage.

A Stretching, Clamorous Training Room~
   Underfoot lies a hardwood floor of slightly worn, scratched 
and marred planks. The clatter of weapons continuously resounds 
throughout the area as bronze-plated soldiers train in this long 
room stretching from east to west. Racks, targets and dummies 
line the walls in a neat and ordered fashion. The walls of stark 
white are bear like bone without flesh. At the far western end 
of the training area, manacles and chains have been affixed to 
the wall at waist height.

South of a Gate Through Fine White Housing~
   Flat land is becoming of this road as it turns southward, 
lined by walls of starch white stone which crumbles roughly in 
places and a gate in the northern wall blocks immediate 
thoroughfare, a pair of crested figures usually seen at the 
sides. Care has been taken to ensure the area is 
well-maintained, bereft of path-weeds, litter or refuse. 
Well-clad individuals pass by on a frequent basis, following the 
path either through the gates to the north or winding south into 
an apparently more populated area. 
   Two-storey housing begins to rise up of rather fine 
architecture and masonry and trees line the side of the road.

South on a Cobbled Road Lined by Starched White Housing~
   The road here, composed of well-cut flagstones, snakes gently 
on its path around fine housing. Window frames are delicately 
formed, usually tainted with splashings of metal paint, giving 
them strong, bold hues and most doors are of a fine, 
well-polished and dark wood. The houses themselves have been 
constructed by fine masons; blocks of clean white rock are 
perfectly fitted, most standing at two storeys high. Individuals 
of fine clothing and groomed appearance travel the paths here. 
In places, one might spy a well-kept garden over a fence. 
   Picket fencing seperates the small, lush green gardens in 
front of the white houses which line the street.

At an Intersection in the Cobbled Road Past White Housing~
   Along this path, flagstones of finely-cut rock are gummed 
tightly together to create a rather smooth path, bereft of weeds 
and litter. The houses here are formed from blocks of brilliant 
white, allowing them to reach around two to three storeys high. 
Windowsills house plant boxes and other adornments, even small 
rose gardens before the house. The broad, tall doors are 
fashioned generally from a dark wood and appear well-polished.

green gardens to the south.

the place bereft of litter and weeds. Well-kept individuals tend 
to be the only inhabitants of the area, giving it a rather clean, 
crisp atmosphere. Window frames are usually hued with metal

   Gardens lie here before housing, well-kept and luscious in

   Cobbles compose this straight road which runs past housing of 
starch stone blocks. The area is populated usually by well-kept, 
well-groomed individuals which seem to be residents in these 
plush houses: window frames hued of various metals, making them 
bolder to the eye; small, fenced gardens before them and tall, 
broad doors of rich wood. Most seem to stand at two or three 
storeys and no more.

Before the Gates of a Lush-Green Park Surrounded by Road~
   One of the many entrances to the park, a small gate is here in 
the low fence of well-polished dark metal. The gate opens out 
onto a wide, lush-green park beyond with a number of flowerbeds 
and decorative plants. A cobbled road runs around the park in 
all directions, skirting the park and along that sits clean-white 
housing, the area bereft of litter.

A Wide Park of Lush-Green Grass and Rich, Decorative Flowerbeds~
   A rather wide park stretches out here of lush green grass and 
flowerbeds of rich, dark soil. Flowerbeds have, in places, been 
arranged into various shapes of semicircles and squares to 
enhance the peaceful atmosphere of this park area. A low fence 
of well-polished black metal skirts the entirety of the area, 
streets and housing seen beyond. Perhaps most spectacle, is a 
large fountain in the centre of the park, sprays and shoots of 
water cascading down the marble pieces to gather in a smooth bowl 
at the bottom. Benches line the fence around this area which 
noticeably, is entirely bereft of litter or refuse.

white stone as the walls and covered with fresh, sweet smelling 
rushes. Furniture is neatly arranged and a small fireplace sits 
at the far end of the room. A heavily shuttered and barred 
window sits in the west wall. The door into the outter room is 
heavy and muffles the sounds of the busy household.

somewhat cramped, with room enough for perhaps two 
broad-shouldered individuals to stand beside each other. The 
floor is solid hardwood, and both walls and ceiling are painted a 
stark off-white. Doorless entryways are set opposite each other 
in the east- and west-facing walls of the foyer, and to the north 
lies the promise of a more expansive room.

solid oak doorways set in both the east- and west-facing walls.

ceiling are both painted a stark off-white. The northern section 
of the room has no furnishings, and stands empty save for the 
relatively large door set in its wall.

not much in the way of extravagance or space. There is room

furniture. No windows adorn the room's walls, nor are there

carved more by weathering than sentient hand. The rounded 
ceiling stretches perhaps seven feet from the stairs themselves, 
and the distance from wall to wall is much the same.

of weathering. Set into the floor, equidistant from each corner, 
are four hollowed spaces all wide enough to plunge a tiny fist 
within. In the room's center lies a stone-hewn table, of 
different origin than the floor it rests upon, plain in make and 
long enough to lay a tall man upon.

rust, though luck be willing a prize may be found from time to 
time. The leather of the tent's walls is well oiled with more 
then one miscolored patch having been used in various repairs. 
During the day sunlight washes in through the open tent flap on 
its northern side, and at night a single lantern hangs from the 
central support.

Wooden Stands Filled With Tiers of Benches, Aimed Down at the Pit~
   These stands are obviously for the common folk of Tur Edendor 
to sit and enjoy whatever may be occuring down in the great Pit 
below. A massive area has been hacked out of the stone and dirt 
of the mesa, forming a steep bowl, the sides of which are made 
even more difficult to scale due to the cruel, gore-decorated 
spike-tipped wooden logs that jut outwards from the lip of the 
depression. Dirt, rock and other rubble has been packed down 
behind this pallisade wall, and it is here that row upon row of 
bench has been set down. Rope lines form rough sections amidst 
the benches, design to seperate the humans from the orks less 
spectators become too caught up in the spectacles below and take 
the fight to the stands, though the sombre presence of the 
crest-helmed Black Watch whenever a fight occurs here seems 
enough to cow most of those who come to watch the blood sports. 
A series of private stone boxes to the north are seperated from 
the rabble by a series of blood-red curtains, each with an 
attendent to make sure those not worthy are kept out.

Crowded, Frantic Betting Area~
   Whenever a fight takes place, this area is packed with orcs, 
goblins, Gondorians, Mordorians, Haradrim and anyone else with 
five heads to their name to lay bets on how the fights will go 
with one of the official bet-takers of the Tur Edendor Pits: the 
group of wizened, shrew goblins standing before the line of 
brutish uruk enforcers. Many private bets take place in the 
corners and shadows of this dirt yard beneath the stand section 
up the steep dirt trail to the east, as rather wealthier figures 
make wagers far beyond the means of the normal denizen that lurks 
about the Tur Edendor Pits. A narrow path leads behind the 
stalls, allowing you access to the battle gate of the Pit.

Stone Boxes Overlooking the Pit~
   A series of fine stone boxes have been constructed out of the 
rock wall of Tur Edendor, aimed to have a commanding view of the 
bloodshed that regularly spills out across the Pit below. The 
reddish, cracked floors of the pit are clearly visible, and every 
blow and scream of pain carries flawlessly to the stone 
receptacles positions here. Plush seating has been arranged, 
along with small wooden tables in the centre of the circles of 
furniture, and the occasional man or goblin servant can be seen 
ferrying food and drink about for their masters. A short 
corridor cut off with a red curtain leads back to the common 
stands to the south.

Before the Blood Decorate Gate To The Pit~
   The towering construction of the Gate to the Pit looms to the 
west, its surface splintered and jagged, metal spikes cruelly 
thrust through it from the other side, making it perfect to 
impale an opponent upon. From the look of the gore that covers 
it, it seems as if this has been the thought of many previous 
gladiators, but the troll-sized gates have easily survived all 
the punishment they have so far seen. The ground is dirt, and 
runs fairly flat to the east and south, but to the west the Gate 
stands, and to the north the steep rocky lip of the Pit rises, 
and atop of that, a series of pointed wooden stakes.

Corpse Littered Corner of the Pit~
   This corner of the Pit bears more than its fair share of 
blood, and gore, and flies, and opportunistic carrion birds. The 
cause is no doubt the heap of ineptly butchered corpses in 
various stages of rotting that have been dragged here and piled 
along the eastern wall by the slaves that tend to the Pit. The 
stench, already a full-blown assault on the nose anywhere in the 
Pit, is near vomit-inducing here, and in certain winds a vertible 
cloud of flies assails the eyes and nose. The footing underneath 
is precarious to say the best, with organs, bones, teeth, hunks 
of hair, skulls and limbs all awaiting an unprepared foot.

Beneath the Jagged Wooden Spikes Surrounding the Pit~
   The jagged wooden spikes that jut out from the stony lip above 
the Pit loom more prominently here than elsewhere, some of the 
cruel-tipped stakes coming close to a man's head and thus 
submitting any who fight here to the risk of cutting their brow 
open, or worse. The dirt ground is hard underfoot, the blood 
that is too frequently spilled here eagerly absorbed by the dry, 
stony mountainside. Above ones head lies the expansive stands of 
the Pit, more often than not filled to the brim with an eager 
crowd of blood-thirsty spectators, some of whom seem but an arm's 
reach away from this section of the Pit.

On The Cracked, Stony Ground of the Pit~
   The stony ground of the Pit seems just as injured and battered 
as the countless slaves, desperate men and prisoners forced to 
battle here, large cracks running through the rocky dirt here. 
Entire sections of the crumbling ground sink a few inches 
underfoot on occasion, or suprise the shoeless combatants here 
with a nasty rock. The steep stony lip of the Pit rises to the 
south and east, preventing any escape from the charnal grounds 
save victory, or death.

Sweat and Blood Stained Waiting Area Behind the Wooden Gates~
   A narrow trail leads in from the west, quickly slipping to 
this underground stone cavern. The air reeks of sweat and blood, 
and with the looming presence of the splintered, gore-decorates 
gates to the Pits to the east, it is not hard to understand why. 
Two rows of wooden benches run up to the damaged gates, weapon 
racks and rusted implements of maiming set up behind them. This 
is where slaves, prisoners, gladiators and madmen who willingly 
participate in the games come before a match is announced, 
waiting for the gates to be thrown open and for the Slavers to 
come and force them out to the blood-soaked floor of the Pit.

Stone Entryway to the Pits~
   While the rest of the Tur Edendor Battle Pits have been 
constructed out of lashed together wooden logs, the entryway has 
been erected out of fashionable and well cut stone, looking to be 
marble. Two squat pillars of stone rise up either side of the 
entrace to form an archway, each adorned with numerous scenes of 
gladiators and criminals battling against incredibly odds, and 
more scenes of slaves and prisoners fallihg beneath blades and 
the fangs, claws, teeth and hooves of animals. A rough ramp of 
packed dirt forms a curving path to the west, winding its way 
around numerous wooden benches as it rises up to a series of 
private boxes, also made of stone. During the days that the Pit 
is in use, goblins and humans can be seen pestering those passing 
by with offers of both food and drink.

Smoky, Sweaty, Derelict Abode Filled with Junkies and Dealers~
   Thick and pungent, this small abode is filled with churning 
smoke. The walls that were once white-washed are now tinged a 
sickly yellow. Indentations and notches scar the walls as well, 
likely being made either by hand or blade. About the room 
misused and broken tables lay scattered amidst crates and 
squatting junkies. The crates are mostly stacked upon the wall 
opposite the only door, but some are used as seats for various 
vagrants. Haggard, sallow, and emaciated humans lounge about 
listlessly, paying close attention to anyone who wanders within 
arms reach. Covered in a thin layer of grime and ash, the wooden 
floor has taken on a gritty texture as well as a black color.

vstr This drugpusher will buy 400 coins of khaskhas for 1000 coins once every 2 RL weeks, if you have the correct sign indicating you're the person the drug pusher should be dealing with at this moment in time.
vbr -
vstr This sign is a scrap of burlap with a special symbol upon it, which indicates you control the supply rights here.
vbr -
vstr If you control the supply rights, and have a complete shipment of khaskhas and have the scrap of burlap in your hand, type "#6supply drugs#0".
vbr -
vstr If you don't control the supply rights, but would like to, read on.
vbr -
vstr You can try and bribe the drugpusher to start buying your khaskhas instead. You will need a 1000 Engren coin in your hand, and then type "#6bribe drugpusher#0". If you suceed, the drugpusher will agree to sell your khaskhas for you, and give you a 200 Engren coin in change.
vbr -
vstr You can try and do a favour for the drugpusher, which will most likely be wiping out his local competition. You can agree to undertake this favour by typing "#6offer favour#0". Next you will need to find his rivals and butcher them, then report back and type "#6claim hit-is-finished#0". If all the rival gang is dead, the drugpusher will agree to sell your khaskhas for you.
vbr -
vstr Alternatively, you can cut a better deal with the drugpusher. This will involve a 1000 Egren coin bribe up front, and forgoing profits for the next two shipments (so you'll only receive 600 instead of 1000). If you suceed in cutting a better deal, then you'll receive a 200 Engren coin in change too. To do this, type, "#6cut deal-with-drugpusher#0".
vbr -
vstr Anyone can offer a better deal to the drugpusher. If you do cut a better deal with the drugpusher, then he will not accept bribes, favours, or better deals from any other gangs and instead act quite loyal to you and your gang.
vbr -
vstr If bribing, cutting a deal, and doing a favour for the drug dealing is not your cup of tea, or available, then you can wipe out the drugpusher and wait for a new one to arise from the slums, who'll obviously be cowed enough to deal with you.
vbr -
vstr To do this, first type "#6attack drugpusher#0", which announce your intention to hold a fight. Once the drugpusher and all of his bodyguards are dead, you can type "#6clear drughouse#0" to establish your dominance over the area. It will take a Real-Life week before a new drugpusher appears, but your gang insignia will appear right now.
vbr -
vstr However, any option of violence will likely attract the attention of the Black Watch, so you are advised to wait in the slums until the heat is off, which typically is a few Real Life hours.
vbr -
vstr If no one has laid claim to the drugpusher, then he will deal with anyone who has a prepared shipment of khaskhas and types "#6supply drugs#0". If a gang does not supply the drugpusher with khaskhas for 4 Real Life weeks, he will abandon them and instead seek to purchase drugs from any gang who has them to sell.
vbr -
vstr Anyone who is a member of the "Rough Element" clan can supply drugs. To join this clan, hang out around the shantytown, and look for more information where you can.
vbr -
vstr #6IMPORTANT NOTE#0: For any commands that involve you giving money to the drugpusher, make sure you only have -one- coin of that kind in your hand. The program will take all of that kind of coin in your hand, so only have one out.

Crude, Khaskhas Reeking Drugden~
   Petty and roughly-made, this shanty is of greying wood and 
rusty nails. The walls have spaces and gaps between the old and 
gnarled wood boards. Muddy and fouled, the ground of the shack 
is littered with shreds of burlap and shattered crates. The 
stench of blood, rot, and excrement occupies the air along with a 
thin haze of smoke and dust.

Crudely Constructed, Ork-Populated Cavern~
   Harshly dug, the grey walls of this rounded cavern bear gouges 
and cracks from a novice use of picks and mattocks. The floor is 
muddied and covered with rotting pelts of fur as well as the 
occasional busted crate. A haze of smoke fills the air, mingling 
delicately with the smell of excrement, blood, and rot.

Cave Grotto Crowded with Shady Orcs~
   This squat grotto is bowl-shaped, the center being a mound of 
half-eaten corpses and the broken remains of crates. Along the 
top, sickly-thin orcs and goblins sit in small clutters, their 
thick and foul smoke permeating the stale air in the cave. The 
once blackened walls and ceiling have been tainted with a gritty 
yellow residue with the occasional splodge of blood or excrement. 
Near the small entrance several stacks of crates line the walls, 
all of them whole and unopened. Brutish orcs run the selling 
here, and dozens of severed hangs, both human and goblin, hang 
from the ceiling, the remains of people who tried to double cross 
or fail to pay the drug runners that work out of this cave.

drugpushing~
help~
vstr This drugpusher will buy 600 coins of khaskhas for 1000 coins once every 2 RL weeks, if the seller's gang controls the supply rights here. You can tell which gang controls the supply rights by what gang object is in the room.
vbr -
vstr Of course, to undergo any dealings with the drugpusher, you will need to be in one of three clans, "Drug Gang One", "Drug Gang Two", "Drug Gang Three".
vbr -
vstr If you control the supply rights, and have a complete shipment of khaskhas, type "#6supply drugs#0".
vbr -
vstr If you don't control the supply rights, but would like to, read on.
vbr -
vstr You can try and bribe the drugpusher to start buying your khaskhas instead. You will need a 1000 Engren coin in your hand, and then type "#6bribe drugpusher#0". If you suceed, the drugpusher will agree to sell your khaskhas for you, and give you a 200 Engren coin in change.
vbr -
vstr You can try and do a favour for the drugpusher, which will most likely be wiping out his local competition. You can agree to undertake this favour by typing "#6offer favour#0". Next you will need to find his rivals and butcher them, then report back and type "#6claim hit-is-finished#0". If all the rival gang is dead, the drugpusher will agree to sell your khaskhas for you.
vbr -
vstr Alternatively, you can cut a better deal with the drugpusher. This will involve a 1000 Egren coin bribe up front, and forgoing profits for the next two shipments (so you'll only receive 600 instead of 1000). If you suceed in cutting a better deal, then you'll receive a 200 Engren coin in change too. To do this, type, "#6cut deal-with-drugpusher#0".
vbr -
vstr Both the current controlling gang and rival gangs can offer a better deal to the drugpusher. If you do cut a better deal with the drugpusher, then he will not accept bribes, favours, or better deals from any other gangs and instead act quite loyal to you and your gang.
vbr -
vstr If bribing, cutting a deal, and doing a favour for the drug dealing is not your cup of tea, or available, then you can wipe out the drugpusher and wait for a new one to arise from the slums, who'll obviously be cowed enough to deal with your gang.
vbr -
vstr To do this, first type "#6attack drugpusher#0", which announce your intention to hold a fight. Once the drugpusher and all of his bodyguards are dead, you can type "#6clear drughouse#0" to establish your dominance over the area. It will take a Real-Life week before a new drugpusher appears, but your gang insignia will appear right now.
vbr -
vstr However, any option of violence will likely attract the attention of the Black Watch, so you are advised to wait in the slums until the heat is off, which typically is a few Real Life hours.
vbr -
vstr If no gang has laid claim to the drugpusher, then he will deal with anyone who has a prepared shipment of khaskhas and types "#6supply drugs#0". If a gang does not supply the drugpusher with khaskhas for 4 Real Life weeks, he will abandon them and instead seek to purchase drugs from any gang who has them to sell.
vbr -
vstr Joining a gang will require you to find out who is in it, and asking them. This you'll have to do in-game. If you want to head up a gang, and all three gang clans are not currently taken, send an email to staff+mordor@middle-earth.us. You'll need to explain how and why your character could lead a gang of drug-shippers in that email.
vbr -
vstr #6IMPORTANT NOTE#0: For any commands that involve you giving money to the drugpusher, make sure you only have -one- coin of that kind in your hand. The program will take all of that kind of coin in your hand, so only have one out.

atecho 69970 #5A seedy, shady, shifty drugpusher#0 sneers at the obvious threat, clicking his fingers and summoning forth a multitude of dark, lurking figures from the shadows.
atecho 66970 As the shapes begin clearer in the light, some appear as drooling khas addicts, hands twitching for a chance to injure any who might interrupt their supply. Others are hardened mercenaries, or suave street dealers, gripping their weapons as if they know how to use them.
atecho 66970 Still more of the shapes are barely human at all, or far from it. Growling, snarling wargs starved to the point of madness have their chains gently unleashed, and the looming figure of a troll lumbers itself upright.

atecho 69970 #5A seedy, shady, shifty drugpusher#0 sneers at the obvious threat, clicking his fingers and summoning forth a multitude of dark, lurking figures from the shadows.
atecho 66980 As the shapes begin clearer in the light, some appear as drooling goblin khas addicts, hands twitching for a chance to injure any who might interrupt their supply. Others are hardened mercenaries, or suave street dealers, gripping their weapons as if they know how to use them.
atecho 66980 Still more of the shapes are barely human at all, or far from it. Growling, snarling wargs starved to the point of madness have their chains gently unleashed, and the looming figure of a troll lumbers itself upright.
atecho 66980 As his band of cuthroats prepare themselves for combat, #5a seedy, shady, shify drugpusher#0 says with a spit. "Yer really wanna take me? Maybe yer better just clear off, an' ah'll forget this happened."

muddied and covered with rotting pelts of fur as well as the 
occasional busted crate. A haze of smoke fills the air, mingling 
delicately with the smell of excrement, blood, and rot.

Booze-Soaked Orkish Brewery~
   This broad cavern reeks of alcohol and other, fouler, 
materials used in the process of orkish brewing. Encrusted vats 
and rotted barrels occupies the corners of the dingy cave, and 
spiders, rats, moss, mushrooms and other intelligent life war 
amongst one another out of sight for dominance. The eastern end 
of the cave is covered by a wooden wall, in which a sturdy door 
opens inwards, leading out to the main room of a tavern. A 
narrow, splippery stone staircase descends deeper in to the cave 
complex.

Before the Gates~
   Paired and massive wrought iron gates rise to the south, 
ornately worked into the shape of vines which entwine 
suggestively into humanoid forms. A heavy bar is positioned to 
fall into place, creating a powerful barrier at the pull of a 
lever, positioned to one side. The courtyard spreads in all 
other directions, a sedate garden interspersed with solid granite 
walkways, blocks merging together in a seamless display of 
craftsmanship. Evenly spaced, stately trees rise to either side 
of the main pathway which leads northwards, branches closing 
overhead to cast a veil over the sky above, while a pathway of 
granite tile stretches to the west, leading to the stable gates.

In the Center of the Courtyard~
   Tall, stately trees surround the center of this courtyard in a 
perfect square, casting their shadows upon the ornate, circular 
table set in the center. Formed of granite into a hollow circle, 
a clear pool sets in its center and the seating is formed of a 
lower, slightly larger ring of stone. The entire square is 
floored with smooth, polished blocks of granite with pathways 
extending in the cardinal directions, the largest stretching from 
north to south. Sprawled in the distance to the north, beyond 
granite tile and lush lawn is an enormous mansion of grey stone, 
rising magnificently into the sky. The two paths to the east and 
west lead respectively to a blocky, utilitarian stone building 
and a squared, slat-roofed structure.

Before the Mansion, Still Under Construction~
   The mansion towers to the north, thick stone walls merging 
into dark wood to form a wide porch, the roof shingled with dark 
slate. Terminating along the norther border imposed by the 
estate, the courtyard stretches in all other directions, a wide 
path of granite stretching southwards towards its' center, while 
grassy expanses spread to the east and west. In the distance to 
the south the center of the courtyard can be seen, surrounded by 
a square of tall, elegant trees, and a set of wooden stairs leads 
up onto the porch to the north. Inset into the wall here are a 
series of fine sculptures which depict all manner of beast, 
ranging from dragon to stag and all cut by the hand of a master 
artisan. Most notable of all is a carven image depicting a great 
fort beseiged by Orc and Black Numenorean, a massive armored 
figure standing tall upon its broken walls, casting limp forms 
down to the muddied ground far below.

A Clean, Capacious Stable~
   Walls of thick oak rise on all four sides of this stable, 
reaching up into the darkness of the roof, while a loft dominates 
the western portion, bearing large bales of hay upon it. A wide, 
wooden gate is set into the eastern wall, opening upon oiled, 
iron hinges. A few errant lengths of hay lay over the wide aisle 
of these stables, but otherwise the high roofed structure appears 
well maintained. The only light that may fill this place filters 
through the large gate to the east or the glass lanterns posted 
along the wooden supports, wicks submerged in canisters of lard. 
The aisle extends westwards, narrowing slightly to make way for a 
series of clean, well kept stalls.

   Fine, oak planks form the walls and gates for the stalls that 
surround this aisle to the north, west and south. The dirt floor 
has been recently swept, a few stray strands of hay laying about 
here and there, but for the most part clear of debris. The 
sounds and smells of the stable are most prevailant here, the 
musky odor of manure and wet hay mixing with the sounds of beast. 
The aisle stretches eastwards, opening into a larger area.

A Spacious Servants Quarters~
   Taking up a broad, airy space, this room is furnished with 
just the bare essentials, creating a tidy, efficient impression. 
Masterly covered by darkly stained wood, the floor appears almost 
seamless and is framed by an wide inset of black marble just 
inches from the wall. The walls are formed by cold, solid 
granite, the dressed stone smoothly polished on the inside. A 
door made of dark-stained wood has been set into the eastern 
wall, flanked by a pair of high, narrow window openings. Along 
that same wall, a variety of organized shelving and cabinet space 
offers room for cleaning and maintenance supplies.

   Walls of solid stone rise on all four sides, terminating in a 
high ceiling of dark wood. A single, sturdy door has been set 
into the western wall, a pair of barred winters inset into the 
stone on either side. A glass lamp hangs in all four corners of 
the building, providing adequate lighting in the otherwise dark 
confines of the room. A series of bunks are set against the 
north wall, each neatly made, blankets tucked crisply beneath 
their mattresses, wooden chests set at the foot of each. A 
small, stone basin sits upon a table in the northeastern corner, 
and a series of shelves and racks dominate the eastern wall.

An Exotic, Decorative Landing~
   A luscious red carpet sits at the top of these marble stairs, 
a polished mahogany banister running their length in parallel 
curves. The walls are composed of coarse granite and decorated 
with any number of paintings, tapestries and carvings. A few 
stands line the skirting of the walls, on top displayed pots, 
vases and other exotic artworks. At an intersection, this 
landing is the focal point of what seems to be an entirely more 
luxurious part of the mansion, hallways extending from all 
directions deeper into this vast establishment. 
   A sturdy, iron-barred door leads downwards to the stairs.

A Domed Reception Room Centered Around a Rock Pool~
   Modest yet comfortable, this reception room has been hollowed 
and spiralled upwards like a bee hive, the granite walls splashed 
with a pure white paint and left open to the sky. The roof has 
been carved in such a way that it spirals in a lofty ascent, the 
hole which is in fact open to the elements is some distance above 
the room. A decorative rock pool lies directly beneath the 
opening, a water feature sloshing over various rocks and lilies. 
A few outdoor pieces of furniture have been positioned around the 
rock pool and some colourful banners and paintings of landscapes 
have been hung on the white walls. A thick wooden door under an 
arch gives entrance to the eastern room and a few torches cast a 
sombre light over the tranquil room at night, adding to its 
sombre atmosphere.

A Pure-White Master Bedroom with Floors of Swirling Marble and Fur Rugs~
   Circular in shape, this seemingly tranquil room has been 
carefully painted with a pure white paint. A few decorative 
circular windows give the room ample light in the daytime and 
through them can be seen the town some floors beneath. 
Animal-fur rugs and other coloured mats lie in intervals about 
the swirled marble floor and paintings, tapestries and banners 
are hung in ascending tiers about the walls. Comfortable 
furniture has been positioned carefully around the room and 
behind a mahogany counter is a tiny bar area. Most noticeably, 
the room is filled with a splashing and trickling of water as 
rock pool and miniature waterfall features have been carefully 
fashioned about the circular room. Two strong doors barred with 
iron lead to the west and north.

A Pale-Green Painted Bedroom~
   Moderately sized, this bedroom is somewhat luxurious in 
atmosphere. Massive blocks of swirling, colourful marble compose 
the floor underfoot and the solid walls of granite have been 
painted a pale green. A few comfortable pieces of furniture have 
been pushed up against the walls and only a couple of tapestries 
and paintings have been hung around the room. Either side of the 
bed is a small table with a drawer and some shelves have been 
arranged above a desk. 
   A solid wooden door gives passage to the hallway beyond.

   The towering granite walls of this long hall have been 
decorated with finely woven tapestries, portraits and other 
memorabilia, the swirling marble floors laid with fur carpets. 
Stands, like small pillars, line the walls on either side, pots 
and vases usually displayed on their top. 
   Three doors are fitted into the fine white walls of the 
hallway; to the east, south and west.

   This bedroom, whilst rather small, appears rather comfortable 
and welcoming. Some effort has been made to ensure a warmth and 
sombre environment: fur rugs have been spread around on the 
swirling marble floor in places and the walls have been painted a 
warm blue colour. A bed sprawled in fine linens has been set up 
against the back wall of the room and at either side sit a small 
table and drawers. The only decoration that has gone into this 
room are a few meagre banners and countryside tapestries.

Gladiator's Locker Room~
   A locker room that holds the gear for the gladiator while they 
are fighting. 

#9#1OOC Warning#0: If you leave this room with the bag of another 
gladiator, be he or she dead or alive, and don't hand it back to 
them right away, the admins will come and insta-kill your 
character unless you can prove it was a genuine, good-faith 
mistake, and nothing was taken when the bag was eventually given 
back to the other party. 

#9#6OOC Warning#0: Remember, once you leave this room, you won't 
be able to get back here until the next fight. Thus, if you 
leave your bag, you'll have to enter the pits again to reclaim 
it, or wait for an admin to help you out, which could take some 
time.

   Crafted of sturdy, darkly stained oak, this porch extends ten 
paces from the great doors of the mansion, flowing into a series 
of steps which lead down to the courtyard. A sturdy rail runs 
along its edge, capped in bronze and a plush, black carpet runs 
from doors to steps. Paired, wooden benches sit to either side 
of the doors, resting beneath wide, glass windows with small 
tables set to their side, each bearing a small bronze smoking tin 
for ash.

   Spacious and clean, smooth granite lines the walls of the 
foyer, giving way to the pearly, marble blocks which make up the 
floor. A great, double door stands to the south, formed of oak 
and decorated with the skilled carvings of an artisan, bronze 
bands running across to lend strength to beauty. Inset into the 
walls, each perched within their own niches, a series of busts 
gaze forth, each carven into a different likeness, though all 
bear an air of nobility and poise. Great banners hang from the 
high ceiling, sweeping down from wall to wall and bearing a 
variety of standards and designs. The foyer stretches 
northwards, broadening into a decorated hall. Set in the 
northern corners of the large chamber are paired, curving stairs 
of grey stone, separated at the bottom and sweeping inwards as 
they rise, joining together before a broad, darkly-stained door 
above the hallway beneath.

   A vast chamber, this great hall bears towering walls of grey 
stone, decorated with banners and portraits of various figures 
and scenes. A thick, woven carpet spreads across the marble 
floor, depicting a sprawling seen of battle, orcs and humans 
engaged in eternal combat. Small tables and chair are scattered 
about the corners of the room, small glass lamps set upon them 
and an ornate chandelier hangs down from the high ceiling, glass 
and candlelight merging into a dazzling display even as it 
provides light to the hall. Hallways, large and small, stretch 
in all directions from this point and the center of the hall has 
been left open, drawing attention to the woven tapestry of the 
carpet underfoot.

   Long and wide, this hallways granite walls are lined with 
portraits, each depicting a man or woman of noble visage, some 
appearing recent while others are quite aged. A long, black 
carpet lends a dark cast to the hallway, aided by the dim 
lighting provided by a series of glass lamps suspended from the 
ceiling. A sturdy door bars the way to the east, comprised of a 
darkly-stained oak and the hall continues to the north and south, 
where it opens into a capacious room.

   Wide, and bearing a high ceiling, this hallways' granite walls 
have been polished to a smooth sheen, allowing the light cast by 
two wall-mounted lamps to play off of their surfaces. The floor 
underfoot is comprised of pearly marble, obscured beneath a fine, 
black carpet which runs the length of the corridor. A modest, if 
finely crafted door has been set into the western wall, the oak 
stained dark, and to the north the granite gives way to a broad, 
glass door, massive windows to either side, overlooking a garden. 
   The hallway continues in the distance southwards, lit 
sporadically by lamps.

hallway have been livened with an extensive display of flowers 
and plant-life, lining the marble floor upon either side and set 
in wide, deep basins filled with earth. The branches of small 
trees and shrubs stretch outwards, making this seem an indoor 
forest, as the hallway continues in both directions. The glass 
lamps which hang from the walls behind the foliage cast strange 
patterns of light and shadow upon the ceiling and floor, and 
stray leaves are scattered across the walkway. To the west the 
hallway ends in a wide archway, opening into a vast dining room, 
the pathway before it swept clean of leaves and foliage.

monotony of stone. The floor underfoot lacks carpeting, the 
translucent white marble lending radiance to the faint light cast 
by the lamps, and the walls are polished smooth. The hall

gaping where it has been etched into the stone. Its wings spread 
across the wall towards a pair of doors, the one to the north 
bearing delicate scrollwork upon its surface, while the southern 
door is small and banded with dark iron, inset into the stone.

An Expansive, Walled Garden~
   Tall walls of granite rise to the west and north of this 
garden, ivy rising up over the grey stone in a chaotic sprawl. A 
walkway of crushed stone extends into the midst of the foliage, 
marking a circle before winding its way eastwards, where the 
scent of beasts is prevalent. Twisted trees rise about the area, 
spaced enough to allow the growth of flowers and herbs beneath 
and a garden has been tucked away against the western wall. To 
the south the great mansion rises, accessed through a pair of 
wide, glass doors, the windows set to either side stretching from 
ground to roof, a single break formed of grey stone forming the 
separation of the second floor.

walls of this area, filled with all manner of creatures. Each 
cage boasts a generous padding of straw and basins for food and 
drink. The varied cries of the animals contained fill the air, 
some commonplace and others rare and frightening and a crushed 
stone walkway runs a circuit before each place of confinement, 
making a large circle. Inset into the center of the walkway is a 
lush pool, the water clear and clean and populated with waterfowl 
and a dense variety of fish. Braziers line the stone walls 
between cages, their open flames providing light and, if needed, 
warmth.

blue light to filter through their shades and a single, small 
table sits in the center of the room, resting atop a woven, oval

iron stands. A marble walkway wraps the chamber floor in an 
elliptical ring of pearly white, leading past a vast number of 
glass-walled display cases, their insides padded with rich, 
crimson silk. Dominating the eastern wall, a woven tapestry 
depicts a vast cavern, a gathering of warriors huddled about a 
massive figure in bronze armor, whilst a gargantuan spider hulks 
over a limp form armored in black, its twin fangs plunged deep 
into the mans chest. A solid, oak door has been set into the 
western wall, the thick wood banded on this side with iron.

and dust. A long table stretches down the middle of the room, 
set between the long, high shelves which dominate the eastern and 
western walls. Dozens of white candles line the center of the 
table, providing enough light to read by, though the far reaches 
of the room are lost in deep shadow. Undecorated and plain, the 
grey stone walls are oppressive and near and every sound made 
echoes in the tight confines. A narrow door of darkly stained 
wood has been set into the southern wall, delicate scrollwork 
scattered across its surface.

A Broad Dining Hall~
   A grand and vast room, this lavishly decorated hall stretches 
wide and far, lit from above by a series of majestic, crystal 
chandeliers, each boasting dozens of long, white candles. Rich, 
bright red banners sweep down between each brilliant source of 
light, gathered up at the corners of the ceiling and billowing 
down at the center. Filling the center of the room is an 
enormous, rectangular table of rich mahogany, stretching from 
east to west and easily capable of seating upwards of thirty 
people in the finely-crafted, silk-cushioned chairs drawn up 
along its length. Set against the walls of this large hall, 
various displays of art, ranging from portrait to tapestry to 
sculpture gleam, each positioned into its own inset niche, the 
grey stone walls boasting a serrated appearance to accommodate 
them. An artful, life-sized portrait of an imposing, massive 
figure in shadow-hued armor is set above the wide archway to the 
west, near the head of the table, and a gleaming, beaded curtain 
obscures what lies beyond an archway to the south. A small, 
nondescript door sits in the northern wall, hidden away between a 
pair of long, red banners bearing the mark of a black eye and to 
the east the hall narrows into an archway of solid stone, the way 
littered with the petals of flowers and leaves.

A Brightly-Lit, Opulent Ballroom~
   The obvious opulence of this room offers a spectacular visual 
display of masterfully carved statues, each unique and made of 
pearly marble. Beautifully formed women are draped in heavy 
swathes of black velvet, their shapely limbs lifted upward to 
hold the ends of sheer red silk which sweep down from the 
ceiling. Alternating, powerful men rise majestically in black 
capes of billowing velvet, strong arms supporting the weight of 
decorative pillars. Several elaborate chandeliers hang from the 
ornately carved ceiling inlaid with dark oak, candlelight 
reflecting off the delicate glass. Two immense fireplaces blaze 
on opposing walls, each flanked by spiralling columns fashioned 
of grey granite. The pearly marble floor is nearly seamless, 
broken only by the contrasting inlay of black marble which 
displays a complex design of whorls and shapes. To the east, a 
wide, angular archway opens into the dining room, divided only by 
a thick velvet curtain.

A Large, Efficient Kitchen~
   Simple and functional masonry has comprised the stoic walls of 
this spacious kitchen, its floor covered with grey granite blocks 
seemingly cut from the same quarry. Kept immaculately clean, 
there is plenty of workspace to allow food preparations fit for a 
grand banquet, from the tables along the wall to the island set 
in the middle of the room. Ample shelving and hanging racks have 
been strategically placed between workspace and the ovens, 
allowing for excellent efficiency. Along with the constant blaze 
within the fireplace, a circle of candles which hang from the 
rafters provide light to work under. A wide arched doorway sits 
to the south, fixed with two solid wooden doors which swing in 
opposite directions. A narrower, square doorway gapes open into 
a dimly lit stairway leading down to the cellar below.

pillars. A hard-packed dirt floor sets the foundation for rows 
of wooden wine racks. Boasting an ideal temperature for storing 
foodstuff, it houses generous space within its shelves and 
pantries. A cleared area in one corner allows storage for larger 
items. Resting against the northern wall, a sharply curving 
stairway leads back up to the kitchen.

cushions, and the ever-present mixture of fragrant smoke swirls 
about the stone ceiling. A darkly-stained, wooden bar curves 
against the western wall, bottles and fine glasses set upon a 
shelf behind it while several cushioned stools sit before it and 
lighting is provided by a single candle upon each table, casting 
flickering shadows upon the grey, stone walls. An archway leads 
eastwards, curving downwards over a few stone steps into a broad 
room beyond, and a small pink door sits in the southern wall, a 
pair of potted plants rising to either side of it.

color. At about ten paces from the wall on all sides the floor 
moves down a single step, making a similar adjustment at another 
five paces, leaving a large ring in the center of the chamber, 
the floor covered with smooth, golden sand. Enough 
ceiling-mounted lamps hang to provide a soothing atmosphere, 
while the ceiling itself curves down to a point at the middle, 
marking the exact center of the room. A broad, stone archway 
leads westwards into another chamber, the sweet scent of mingled 
smoke flowing down the short set of stone stairs.

multitude of thick pillows of all sizes have been tossed about at 
random, tangled with comfortable blankets. Thick, white-painted 
oak panels coat the walls, joining smoothly together and 
providing a background for vast tapestries depicting tasteful 
nudes, women entwined in artfully depicted acts of love. No 
tables or chairs can be found in this room, only thick pillows 
and cushions and a small, pink painted door has been set in the 
northern wall.

   A somewhat balmy feeling lingers in the atmosphere as one 
passes through this bleak and tall hallway. Gray brick lends the 
area a stark environment as well as a distinct lack of decoration 
save a few banners hung on the eastern archway. Footsteps echo 
loudly up and down this passage as members of the Black Watch 
move through. A narrow stair winds upwards and north slightly, 
opening out onto a busy messhall.

Second Floor of the Civics Office~
   The second floor of the building has been fashionably 
constructed out of dark-hued wood, building on to the sandstone 
first floor. A rich, dark carpet occupies much of the circular 
lobby floor here, save for a wide stone staircase that leads 
downwards. Archways lead off to the north, east, west and south, 
and an impressive bust of a demonic, shadowy figure looks from 
atop a marble pillar in a corner of the room.

War Room~
   A large, round, circular table dominates nearly all the 
available space in this room, the circular walls covered with 
maps of Middle Earth, Ithilien, Gondor, Mordor and many more 
locations, most of them covered with chalk marks over the tile 
depictions of geography. The domed ceiling lets in light during 
the day through its leaded windows, and at night and during 
stormy weather bright lanterns are lit, ensuring this room is 
always kept bright. An open arch leads westward, to the lobby of 
the second floor of the Civics Office.

A Busy Shop Front~
   This fresh smelling shop front opens out into the market 
through a beaded-entry, the wood floor and walls stained a 
honey-yellow colour. A counter has been set up at the rear of 
the shopfront, a thick door leading beyond into the building. 
Shelves have been aligned along the walls, displaying baked goods 
in various heights. Stands have also been arranged on the floor 
to further hold and display the rounded room's stock.

A Dank, Little Alcove~
   This alcove is obviously used for storage. It is cramped with 
barely enough space to fit two men shoulder to shoulder. This is 
largely due to the deep, multi-tiered shelves which line all the 
walls save the northern one, where the makeshift wagon-wheel door 
is situated. An old, tarnished tin lamp hangs from a chain in 
the center of the ceiling, casting a flickering light over the 
space.

Underground River~
   The filthy flow of refuse-filled waters lead from north to 
south past the craggy cavern walls, the occasional sluice opening 
in the rock ceiling, an action which is invariably followed by a 
bucketfull of human byproduct. The distant roar and splash of 
water can be heard from the north, but the squeak and scurrying 
of rodents is still audible despite it. The cavern extends in 
all directions, save the east, where a jagged wall of rock lies.

Underground River Beneath a Hole in the Cavern Roof~
   The water here flows slowly, filled with thick sludge of human 
waste continually added from various holes in the cavern ceiling 
above. The air reeks with human refuse, and many a floating blob 
of such waste can be seen swirling down to the south. Whilst the 
water is typically only waste high, there are deep holes 
underfoot. The noise of surging water comes from the north, and 
a large hole can be seen in the ceiling, a rusty ladder of iron 
bars leading up to it.

Gladiator's Locker Room~
   A locker room that holds the gear for the gladiator while they 
are fighting. 

#9#1OOC Warning#0: If you leave this room with the bag of another 
gladiator, be he or she dead or alive, and don't hand it back to 
them right away, the admins will come and insta-kill your 
character unless you can prove it was a genuine, good-faith 
mistake, and nothing was taken when the bag was eventually given 
back to the other party. 

#9#6OOC Warning#0: Remember, once you leave this room, you won't 
be able to get back here until the next fight. Thus, if you 
leave your bag, you'll have to enter the pits again to reclaim 
it, or wait for an admin to help you out, which could take some 
time.

ornate carpets. The roof is high, arching upwards in a large dome
and giving ample space within; a decorative chandelier hanging from
its center upon a long golden chain, numerous candles set about
its polished metal exterior. The room is home to lush furniture,
the most prominent a large round table settled in its center beneath
the hanging chandelier. Set within the eastern wall is a tall, dark
wooden door which leads through into the kitchen, right next to the
coiling metal and wood staircase leading up to the second storey.

A Brightly-Lit Kitchen~
   Set upon long metal beams, this room is filled with pots, pans and
other cooking utensils, dangling from the ceiling in an oddly ordered
manner. Cupboards line the white stone walls, settled mostly into the
corners of the warm room. A long bench set through the centre of this
room, home to more tools of the trade, is the only other thing to note
in this reasonably well kept room, devoid of anything overly luxurious
or expensive. Off in the far corner of the room sits a trapdoor into
the basement.

A Cold, Secluded Basement~
   A small staircase descends from the trapdoor, leading into a room
filled with fresh, chill air. A few metal sconces are set in the walls,
twisting about the torches in a wraithlike pattern, giving them a
subdued elegance and offering dim light to the room. It is well
ventilated, bereft of excess moisture and leaking. The floor here has
been left bare, cold underfoot and smooth; it glints dully in the light.
Being spacious, the sound within is magnified; the slightest noise
echoing away within the dark corners of the room.

A Narrow White-Stone Hallway~
   This long and narrow hallway is austere, bearing little 
decoration for all the space it has spare. A couple of 
terracotta vases sitting on the cold stone floor hold a small 
tree each, the only additions to the passage. Halfway down its 
length, beaded curtains hang over a break in the wall that opens 
out onto a spacious veranda overlooking the streets below, and 
further, the markets of Tur-Edendor. The ceiling is again domed, 
supported by high arches made from crisply cut stone.

A Wide, Sweet-Smelling Bedroom~
   Double doors open into this spacious and well decorated room. The
walls are bare, light, from sun or candle, is reflected by the white
stone and adding to the high level of ambient light in the room. Dark
curtains cover a large and clear window which is set upon the western
wall, a view of Tur-Edendor markets given and even some of the higher
hills of Ithilien. A vase sits beside the door, containing a well
watered plant showing off a host of pale blue flowers. A faint smell
of incense hangs in the air, especially around the myriad of candles
kept in place by metal frames.

A Dimly-Lit Study~
   Large dusky windows set in the far wall of this cramped room give it
a dull illumination along with the candles set on various pedestals.
Large shelves line the high stone walls, filled with various sheets of
parchment, tomes and books. The room is well kept and clean; the sweet
smell of incense wafting about, though not overly strong. Carpets line
the white floor, keeping ones feet from the stone.

A White-Tiled, Railed Veranda~
   White stone tiles have been masterfully laid down here on the floor
of this spacious veranda, high pillars supporting it from below. Overhead
a skeletal frame is built, home to dangling vines and a few flowers.
It provides some good protection from the weather. Below the market
place can be seen, crowds milling about the various stalls and tents
in a haphazard and aimless manner, shouts audible from the numerous
hawkers and dealers which populate the area. A low stone fence surrounds
this semi-circular veranda, held in place by supporting pillars; half
as tall as the average person.

Dismal Shantytown Shopfront~
   This dismal store stocks those items which are in demand 
amongst the denizens of shantytown. Tarnished copper pots, 
lengths of mouse-nibbled string, clothes so thin almost 
see-through, sacks of hay for use to cover floors and stuff beds, 
and other such objects only the poorest of the poor need, or 
want. The building itself is made of sturdy wood and stone, and 
one corner behind the rickety counter holds a tiny bunk.

extortion~
help~
vstr This shopfront is ripe for shaking down the storekeep for payments. If you manage to strongarm this storekeep, he will pay you 100 coins of protection money every 2 Real Life weeks. The following commands can be used here:
vbr -
vstr #6make collection#0: If you have the correct token, indicating you're the person extorting the shop or a friend thereof, the shopkeep, if present and has a collection ready, will give you 50 coins, take th old token and give you a new token to indicate you're the correct supplier for next time, and tell you to come back in 2 RL weeks for the next payment.
vbr -
vstr #6shakedown shopkeep#0: If you want to be the person to provide protection here, and claim the money for doing so, typing this will announce your challenge to the shopkeep. You'll most likely have to fight off some of the local muscle in doing so, though...
vbr -
vstr #6extort shopkeep#0: After wiping out the previous set of muscle protecting the store, typing this will force the shopkeep to be loyal to you. However, at first, he will have run off to avoid the slaughter. Never fear, the shopkeep will return in 4 Real Life days, and then in another 10 days pay collection money to whoever holds the token taken from one of the bodies of his previous thugs.
vbr -
vstr If no one makes a collection from the shopkeep for 4 Real Life weeks, then their token will morph in to nothingness, and the shopkeep will have to be shakendown and extorted before anyone can begin to make collections again.

Reeking Khaskhas Den~
   This small house is filled with burlap sacks padded with 
straw, and a few old and thoroughly ragged chairs. At any one 
time a number of gaunt individuals can be seen draped over the 
furniture, dreamy smiles on their face and a sweet smoke rising 
from the pipes held in their hands. A small fire burns in the 
centre of the floor, contained by a ring of blackened stones, and 
a number of discarded clay pipes lay about there. The air is 
thick with smoke, both sweet and bitter to the nose. A rickety 
door opens out to the west.

vstr This shopfront is ripe for shaking down the storekeep for payments. If you manage to strongarm this storekeep, he will pay you 100 coins of protection money every 2 Real Life weeks. The following commands can be used here:
vbr -
vstr #6make collection#0: If you have the correct token, indicating you're the person extorting the shop or a friend thereof, the shopkeep, if present and has a collection ready, will give you 50 coins, take th old token and give you a new token to indicate you're the correct supplier for next time, and tell you to come back in 2 RL weeks for the next payment.
vbr -
vstr #6shakedown shopkeep#0: If you want to be the person to provide protection here, and claim the money for doing so, typing this will announce your challenge to the shopkeep. You'll most likely have to fight off some of the local muscle in doing so, though...
vbr -
vstr #6extort shopkeep#0: After wiping out the previous set of muscle protecting the store, typing this will force the shopkeep to be loyal to you. However, at first, he will have run off to avoid the slaughter. Never fear, the shopkeep will return in 4 Real Life days, and then in another 10 days pay collection money to whoever holds the token taken from one of the bodies of his previous thugs.
vbr -
vstr If no one makes a collection from the shopkeep for 4 Real Life weeks, then their token will morph in to nothingness, and the shopkeep will have to be shakendown and extorted before anyone can begin to make collections again.

Dismal Shantytown Shopfront~
   This dismal store stocks those items which are in demand 
amongst the denizens of shantytown. Tarnished copper pots, 
lengths of mouse-nibbled string, clothes so thin almost 
see-through, sacks of hay for use to cover floors and stuff beds, 
and other such objects only the poorest of the poor need, or 
want. The building itself is made of sturdy wood and stone, and 
one corner behind the rickety counter holds a tiny bunk.

The Eastern Barracks~
   A number of plain, wood-framed bunks line this wide room, 
though the roof rests low and the northern wall is close to that 
of the south. The floorboards are sturdy and covered by a large 
drab grey rumbled rug movement. Thin slits serve for windows on 
the two far sides of the room at the east and west, providing a 
small amount of sunlight and fresh air. Torches rest in sconces 
at random intervals away, as good a distance from the bunks as 
the room's size will allow. The western doorway is covered by a

Messhall and Kitchen~
   Stepping into this room instantly greets one with the smells 
of various foods, regardless of the time. During its busy hours 
this kitchen is filled with steamy aromas and is bustling with 
the sounds of cooking and shouting. A stone oven covers the 
eastern wall, often containing the smells of baked goods unless 
it has undergone a recent cleaning. Simple but sturdy wood makes 
up the flooring and walls of this room and a solitary window 
stands open on the northern wall. The wooden roof has a closable 
wooden vent to be used if too much smoke or steam gathers in the 
area.

three decently sized cages line the far wall. A number of

walls with a small gutter running through the dungeon often 
overflowing to fill the bottom of the cages. A putrid smell is

An Exotic Garden Before a Sizeable Villa~
   Extending over several furlongs of land, this highly arable 
garden has been seeded with all manner of luxurious plant life; 
deep, thick grasses grow in tidy and manicured lawns, and 
numerous boulders of various sizes are slick with moss. The 
garden is bordered by a granite wall around seven foot high, and 
all along the wall, neatly pruned poplars grow in organized 
lines. A few sandalwood trees grow in various corners of the 
yard, gently filling the yard with their scent. A cobblestone 
path has been laid from the front gate, extending all the way to 
the series of semi-circular steps leading to the front porch of 
the Villa. Along the path, neat shrubberies and all manner of 
beautiful and exotic flowers have been planted; lavender, lion's 
paw, and belladonna all grow together. Around two dozen 
brightly-feathered peacocks wander about the lawns, displaying 
their cheerful plumage. It looks as if various creeper vines 
have been planted at the foot of the villa's walls, however it 
will be several generations before they reach full size.

An Ostensibly Well-Decorated Receiving Room~
   Coming through the ornately-worked cedar door that leads in 
from the garden, the thing one sees is a larger than life sized 
pewter statue of a haradaic-featured man nearing the end of his 
youth. The statue stands in the center of the room, the base of 
which rests upon a polished brass pedestal, and extending outward 
from the base of the statue the floor is a tiled mosaic, forming 
an enormously complex, self-repeating pattern that extends all 
the way to the walls of the room. The tiles themselves are made 
of blocks of masterly worked marble, their natural colours being 
incorporated into the design, adding to the captivating patterns. 
The room itself is nearly two stories tall, the walls made of 
enormous bricks of granite with red cedar supports and joins. 
They have been decorated immodestly but tastefully with 
tapestries and tile mosaics showing geometric patterns of varying 
complexity. The roof of the room is a hemispherical dome of lead 
glass, capturing and reflecting the light in such a way that the 
light in the room is always shifting. On either side of the 
room, a fireplace made out of the same granite as the walls sits, 
a black wrought iron screen of latticed pattern, almost a grill 
but for the superficial thickness of the strands, and the 
vertical alignment. They currently sit empty - sweeped clean of 
soot and ash. A set of storey-and-a-half double doors lead 
deeper into the house.

statue~
vstr This statue, rendered entirely from pewter, depicts an athletically proportioned man wearing an ornate suit of brigandine maille. His features are decidedly haradaic, though the dark-grey pewter is unstained by any dye. He is shown in larger than life proportions, standing at around nine foot tall, and he has a neatly trimmed beard and cropped hair. His stance is one of stern command; he stands with his arms folded across his chest, eyes sternly focused on the door. At his side is a long scimitar, the hilt shaped like a cobra's head, but it is in its sheath.

A Wide, Marble-Floored Parlour~
   This room is fairly expansive, around twice as wide as it is 
deep. The floor is made of tiles of polished marble, keeping to 
the natural colours and patterns of the marble itself. The 
ground has been overlaid with richly hued silk carpets and rugs 
in places, a feature also found on the walls - thicker, more 
elaborate carpets adorn the walls, hanging from iron rods with 
spherical ends. The cedar wood supports on the walls have been 
carved into detailed mathematical patterns, evidently made by the 
hand of a superior craftsman over some time. In one corner of 
the room, a single step leads to a slab of marble that forms a 
stage, able to serve for musicians, dancers, or any variety of 
entertainer. A granite staircase lines the opposite wall, gently 
working its way up and around the room - the roof of which stands 
two storeys from the ground. The staircase flattens out once it 
reaches the first story, and wraps around the parlour for half a 
revoloution, before continuing straight and into a hall. A thin, 
decorated iron handrail keeps the stair user safe from a fall. 
Although the vast bulk of the roof is two storeys, a dome in the 
very center rises to perhaps more than three. It has a skeletal 
wall structure which is on the slope, rather than the rim, of the 
hemisphere, allowing in light and air, but keeping the vast bulk 
of the weather out. It has shutters that can be drawn closed in 
inclement weather. Suspended from the central support in the 
room, and lashed to nearly every other support by an iron chain, 
a ring of metal is suspended over the room, designed as a 
chandelier. It is kept stocked with thick, slow burning candles, 
and gently lights the room at night. There is a wooden lever in 
a hidden nook of the room which allows it to be winched down to 
the ground, for purposes of maintainence. A door to the east 
leads into a hall of some kind, and to the north, curtained 
doorways lead out onto a back terrace.

A Portrait-Lined Hall~
   This hall extends from the stair to the second storey, leading 
deeper into the house. Approximately as wide as three men 
abreast, this hall is lined with portraits of Haradaic faces; all 
Male, all Haradaic. The perceptive observer would note that the 
portraits on the right are all older men, whereas the portraits 
on the left are all younger men. An even more perceptive 
observer would note that the portraits on the left and the right 
directly opposite one another are of the same men, at different 
ages. The hall is lit by demure candelebras, spaced evenly along 
the length of the hall. The floor has been covered with a single 
long carpet of silk. There are rooms to the south and west, and 
the hall continues to the north.

A Stately, Discrete Drawing Room~
   This room is fairly private, with small, high windows and 
thick granite walls. The floor is polished marble, with an 
enormous circular carpet depicting a golden Cobra with a tall 
crown. Along one side of the room, a wall is lined with cedar 
bookcases full of books and scrolls, all the way to the roof. 
The other walls are adorned with weapons and armour of various 
sorts, several maps, and along the opposite wall to the 
bookcases, hanging above an impressively large stone fireplace, 
one of the enormous ivory tusks of a Mumakil. The door has a 
retractable wooden beam that can be fixed across the door as an 
effective lock.

A Luxuriously Appointed Bedroom~
   This bedroom, whilst clearly not the master bedroom of the 
house, is nonetheless quite luxuriously appointed. It is by no 
means small, and there is a long window on the southern wall that 
provides a splendid view of the front garden. The walls are 
likely granite underneath, however a veneer of pale sandalwood 
with framing and supports of red cedar has been erected. Several 
silk tapestries can be seen on the walls, and there is a broad 
portrait of the entire manor, probably painted from the 
surrounding countryside, hung above the dresser.

   This hallway continues from its begginings, making a sharp 
bend towards the north. The southern end of the hall has several 
portraits, but they come to an end - empty spaces obviously 
intended to hold the portraits of future masters of the 
household. A similar carpet of silk has been laid along the 
length of the hall, though not adjoining the other directly. The 
door at the northern end of the hall is tall and broad, with 
posters of wood carved into the image of cobras entwining 
themselves around a pillar. There are doors to the east and west 
also.

A Marble Bathroom and Water Closet~
   Four walls and a floor of magnificent marble tiles mark this 
room as a bathroom. Each individual tile of white marble has 
been hand painted with an intricate border pattern of slithering 
snakes, each one reproduced exactly as each of the others to the 
naked eye. The roof is also made of marble tiles, but they are 
made of many bright and vibrant colours, arranged in a complex 
fractal swirl. A small dumb-waiter near a large cast-iron tub 
allows heated water to be bucketed up here from downstairs. The 
bathtub sits on a one-step podium, with a shallow half-step 
leading up to it. In another section of the room, behind a 
hanging screen of silk and beads, a chair with a hole in it, 
placed over a sloped shaft leading somewhere downstairs can be 
seen. It is made of lacquered wood, and is fairly utilitarian. 
Beside it is a large bucket of water always kept full by the 
servants, and a basin with a fresh towel.

An Opulent Master Bedroom~
   The mud huts of a sizeable village could fit inside this vast 
bedroom, albeit stacked together. Every creature comfort 
imaginable - and then some - is to be found somewhere within its 
walls. The centerpiece of the room, on a raised podium of marble 
steps, is a gargantuan poster bed, made of a heavily scented dark 
wood of indiscernable nature. Silks and carpets of richly dyed 
colours - purples, golds, blues - have been draped all over the 
bed, and indeed, all over anything possible. Fine rugs and 
carpets have been placed to cover all but a few inches of 
floorspace - large, plush cushions and pillows placed in circles 
at various points. A study crib appointed richly with silken 
haberdashery sits close by the bed. There is a big round table 
in one portion of the room, a comfortable mahogony desk in 
another. Trophies of various large game animals, as well as 
several shields and standards adorn the walls. One entire 
section is taken up by a silk screen, surrounded by cedar 
bodiours. A small, delicately appointed shrine with various 
miniature painted pewter statues of deific figures is against one 
wall, lit by a series of ornate candles. In the centre of the 
shrine, a male and female figure, the female cradling a small 
child, stand holding hands.

An Intimate, Richly Decorated Dining Hall~
   Compared to the Parlour to the west, this room is fairly 
intimate - although it is by no means cramped. The tone of this 
room is slightly different than the rest of the estate; a warm, 
hearthy mahogony. The furniture and the walls are made of that 
material, and the floor is polished hardwood instead of marble. 
Various pictures hang in stately frames about the wall - mostly 
depicting either Haradaic men (and some women), or Snake-related 
pieces of artwork. Behind the head of the table, a bronze cobra 
head of staggering proportions - ivory fangs bared, with fiery 
eyes of gemstone - has been erected, sitting around three feet 
above the head of the table when seated. There are pre-appointed 
gaps in the artwork and wall adornments where the servants are to 
stand during meal time. A door of beads to the north, on the far 
eastern boundary of the northern wall, would seem to lead to the 
kitchen - with servants quarters to the east, and a large granite 
fireplace on the south wall.

about them. The roof overhead is shallowly sloped, and covers 
the entirety of the deck area, keeping the weather largely out.

gutted and bare - walls are being erected about a wooden frame, 
and scrawny, dark-tanned men work to finish the roofing. The 
scents of fresh lumber and sawdust waft in the air. Laborers go 
busily about their work. Placed tiles are being hastily torn up 
and restacked in crates in a corner, along with crates of nails 
and stacks of fresh lumber. A foreman is shouting orders and 
supervising the construction.

Crowded, Rectangular Auction Tent~
   The gaudily coloured linen of this large tent is supported by 
four stout wooden poles sunk deeply in to the ground, forming a 
long rectangle. Hooded tin lamps hang from each of these posts, 
casting a grimy light over the multitude of orcs and humans that 
gathered here to shout and haggle over whatever is for sale 
today. Four grim wooden tables have been arranged in a rough 
square, on one side bustling a team of young goblins and boys 
directed by the auction master, the other where all manner of 
merchants and warriors line up waiting for their turn to argue, 
cajole and plead for whatever has caught their eye. The tent 
opens up in all directions back to the Market Square.

A Spartan Livingroom~
   A sparsely decorated room, what artistry and furniture visible 
are nevertheless of considerable quality. A single portrait 
rests against the plain stone of the eastern wall, depicting a 
dark-haired beauty with pale flesh and nearly black eyes while 
the three remaining walls are bare. A soft, black carpet covers 
the grey stone floor, stretching from wall to wall. A lamp rests 
upon a stand at each corner of the room while a fifth hangs from 
a linkage of bronze down in the center. Darkly stained, oak 
doors rest to both the north and the south, matching in every 
detail.

An Extravagant Master Bedroom~
   Polished, grey stone merges with fine black carpets in a 
chaotic sprawl across the floor of this expansive bedroom, each 
stone block joined with perfect seams, lustrous and gleaming in 
the light shed from the chandelier that hangs down from above. 
An ornate bathing pool has been inset into the floor at the 
northeastern corner of the room, grey stone giving way to a 
circle of marble that extends a pace from the edges of the pool 
in all directions, while moving inwards it descends in 
half-crescent steps, leading into the watery depths. A tall 
window of smoky glass rests behind the pool, allowing the bather 
a view of the gardens beneath, and a door of similiarly colored 
glass sits a bit to the side, leading out onto a small balcony. 
To the south and east are matching doors, darkly stained oak 
carved with ornate scrollwork.

   Comfortably secluded and sheltered by a scrollworked overhang

below and beyond the distant wall the rooftops of other homes and 
buildings can be seen, granting any who stand here an excellent 
view of the city. The floor and railing are formed of the same 
polished, grey stone as the rest of the house and a door of 
smoked glass is set into the southern wall, a small lamp affixed 
into the stone beside it by a bronze clasp.

paces beyond the western and southern doors a polished wooden 
floor meets the stone in a seamless merger, extending across the 
the room. Aged tapestries hang from all four walls, interspersed 
with delicate, bronze oil lamps while one wardrobe stands apart 
from the rest, massive and formed of solid oak, darkly stained 
and casting shadows from its position against the eastern wall.

   This bedroom is made of cedar-wood panels and has been stained 
to a warm brown-orange color. It offers an open view of the 
entry room below from which it is separated by several feet and 
maple-wood railings. The ceiling stands about seven feet from 
the floor at its tallest, slanting inward to the north. A 
single, tiny glass window rests on the left side of the northern 
wall and a brass lantern hangs on the right. The only obvious 
exit from this room is a ladder at the break in the rails, 
leading to the room below.

In a Rancid Tunnel through the Mountains~
   Growing darker as the tunnel pierces the foreboding mountains 
of the Ephel Duath, its walls are crumbling and interwoven with 
spider webs and ivy. A rancid smell drifts through the tunnel 
and surrounding offshoots - many too small for the average 
humanoid - and pieces of clothing lay strewn about the place, 
torn into shreds. Collections of ivory bones lie at intervals 
down the trail, set in triangular piles with a skull at their 
top. Footsteps are amplified in volume, echoing loudly down the 
forthcoming tunnels.

Crumbling Tunnel Deeper in the Ephel Duath Range~
   The tunnel snakes deeper into the dark rock of this mountain 
range, any sign of life from the entrance now long gone. 
Footsteps echo deeply and reverberate throughout and off the 
cave's crumbling walls. A rancid smell wafts through the system 
of small rocky offshoots and various pieces of clothing have been 
torn and shredded at various points in the room, blood staining 
them a crusty maroon.

Descending Lofty Tunnel Through Jagged Caverns~
   The bone and clothing in this area seems to have become 
utilized in a somewhat more resolute fashion: small ivory shards 
and squares of blood-stained cloth have been wrapped around one 
another; torn; snapped; ripped, all in what seem like an attempt 
to either garishly decorate the area or as a deterrent to anyone 
who ventured into these rancid smelling passages through the 
mountain. The vast, towering caverns have tunnels snaking in a 
few directions, one in particular moving in a downward slope, 
opening out abruptly. 
The cavern floor here shows recent sign of disturbance, large 
footprints scattered across it.

   These tunnels have been roughly carven by living beings, 
notably, with tools too large for ordinary humanoids or Orkin. 
The trail twists left and right on its sharp descent and on its 
coarse edges various garish pictures depicting massive hulking 
forms engaging in torture and feasts have been painted with 
blood, now dried a maroon in color. 
   The bitter smell of rotting flesh intensifies as vast caverns 
become visible somewhere to the south.

Vast Natural Caverns Beneath the Ground, Stinking of Decay~
   Like adjoining bubbles of solid rock and rubble, these caverns 
are closely interlinked by high arches, giving the place a vastly 
spacious affect. Razor-sharp stalactites hang precariously from 
the higher reaches of the caves here, unseen squeaks and 
shuffles. What little light is cast in the area is not enough to 
stretch throughout the entirety and large patches lie in a dim 
shadow. Tattered pieces of leather, clothing, scatterings of 
shattered bone, blood and festering meat garishly decorate the 
cavern's floor space and thick wads of moss and other night 
plants cling to the rough walls of the hacked caverns.

horses running across blood-red sand on the southern wall. A 
wide window of glass has been set in the northern wall with 
beaded curtains on either side. The floors are built of 
sandalwood panels, but there is a large scarlet rug with golden 
embroidery set in the middle of the floor. 
   There is a doorway facing the east, with a carving of an 
obsidian snake winding itself around it.

A Pale, Comfortable Bedroom~
   This moderately sized bedroom's walls are painted in hues 
somewhere between a light blue and a cream colour. The floor is 
composed of milky marble tiles, cold to the feet and about a 
square foot in size. There is a doorway facing westwards and on 
the northern wall there is a small window, opening into the

A Dusty, Tight Fissure in the Mountains~
   This gap is just large enough for a toned humanoid to squeeze 
through. The lay of the rocks is such that the fissure bends 
around and away from sight on the trodden road where traffic can 
sometimes be seen. The fissure - stretching high above into the 
peaks - is dusty and the air is balmy and continues for some 
distance away from the road. A rickety wooden door covers 
further exit beyond that.

A Roughly-Hacked Hollow in the Mountain~
   Ovoid in shape, this hollow is a further extension to the 
gaping crack that led you here. It has been hand-hacked with 
tools and is somewhat spacious in that the place is bare: some 
shelves have been hewn into the sides and the area is somewhat 
dusty and dry. A few drab cloths have been thrown over smaller 
outcrops in the walls or onto the floor in meager decoration but 
nothing more has been done to conceal this desolate quarters.

A Hollow, Roughly-Hacked Cave~
   This cave, while certainly a most uncomfortable living spot, 
has been hacked by living beings judging by the large instrument 
marks hewn into the dusty walls. Loose rock and rubble lines the 
floor in various places at the surrounding walls' base and on the 
face of it in places, blood has been spattered in a haphazard 
fashion, almost decorative. A few spots have been cleared in 
this moderately sized cavern, straw and tattered clothing laid 
down to accommodate a little more comfort. 
   In a northern slice of the dank cave a small shore sits in a 
hemicycle around a dark watered cavern lake.

   The curved, rough ceiling of this section of the caverns is 
particularly high and dripping stalactite hangs down in a 
taunting surveillance of those beneath. Every now and then small 
red eyes may be seen in the higher shadows of the area, watching. 
Smeared blood, festering meat and pieces of smashed bone have 
been strewn over the dusty floors, a thick, deep green moss 
covers the roughly-hewn walls.

Hollowed Out Cavern~
   The sounds of an underwater stream echo off the walls of this 
vast cavern. Someone with considerable skill has seen to the 
excavation of this place as the floor is fairly smooth, and the 
walls do not appear to be in any danger of collapsing. The water 
from the running stream has been diverted into a well-designed 
pump system that seems to run through the ceiling of the cavern. 
A miniature water-mill has been erected and with the force of the 
underground tributary seems to be operating the gears of the pump 
system.

Exotic Bathing Area~
   Steam constantly rises up from the bath water in this chamber, 
signaling that the water is always kept hot. A multitude of 
aromas waft through the humid air here, ranging from that of 
orchids and lilies to roses and oleanders. Four massive 
skylights in the ceiling allow ample amounts of natural light to 
filter in, but are also designed to keep out rain or snow. Ivy 
overruns the walls and many flower-laden trees spring up to 
either side of the flowing fountain on the northern wall. A 
lone, shallow bath sits here, but takes up more than half the 
space in the room, giving ample room for many patrons to relax in 
the hot water.

The artistry and effort that went into such a production is something to
be admired.  Directly opposite the western doors is the image of a man
who stares forward with a hateful glower.  He is decked in black armor
and stands alone upon a white shore, driving a banner into the ground
with a look of defiance.  Behind him in the violent seas are dozens of
warships of massive proportions, their black masts spanning high into
the fiery skies amidst a terrible lightning-storm.  It is a grim depiction,
full of rage and splendor.

lantern hangs from the ceiling throwing it's precious light 
across the many shelves and bookcases. The room is spartan and

A Large Rock Pool in a Recess of the Cliff~
   This rock pool sits in a grotto type recess in the cliff face 
and without the water, it would be an ordinary cave. The water 
is deep and surprisingly clear - a number of sharp rocks lining 
the bottom some distance beneath where a small underwater tunnel 
seems to emerge, snaking southward. Some small fish might be 
seen swimming through the pool, nibbling at slimy moss lining the 
pool's jagged walls. 
   A few underwater passages are cut through the jagged rock 
walls.

   The surroundings of this narrow tunnel cut through the rock 
are coated in a slimy moss. Jagged offshoots sprout from the 
walls and the bottom of the tunnel precariously blocking some 
channels southward. Few creatures may be seen down here but the 
way seems to snake eastward more, the way becoming somewhat 
tighter.

debris, water creatures sometimes seen swimming between them. A 
few wispy green weeds grow underwater in the darker recesses.

slightly downward here and a few other paths through the rock can 
be found - the one to the north opening out like a large mouth in

a pair of double gates wrought from polished, engraved iron. On 
its face a vast image depicting a raven has been delicately hewn 
with fine instruments, its large eyes peering off to the west and 
the rest of the compound. The courtyard is not overly large and 
is squared in shape. The floor made from rows of cobbled stones 
is covered mostly with straw and animal pelts. On all sides 
walls rise up; to the east, south and west wooden doors are set 
for access to other parts of the barracks.

into reasonable light westward and a door blocks access to the

On the eastern door a large raven is depicted, carved firmly into 
the wood. The floor is carpeted with fine pelts and during the 
winter aids the room in its insulation. In the summer, a small 
window or two look out onto the rest of the compound.

   These barracks are reasonably well kept and have a somewhat

stage or another by milling soldiers that come to rest on their 
off-time.

vegetables, bread - is constant throughout the day, as are the

area. Fallen trunks, rotting leaves, thick vines, thickets and 
dying branches litter the forest floor in the natural process of

of the woodland is somewhat steep and grows on a steady incline 
to the north as the forest thickens, becoming darker.

A Tiny Makeshift Infirmary~
   The warm, moist smell of blood always lingers in the air here. 
The floors show spots of an ever-perpetual crimson hue but seem 
relatively clear of excess debris. Tables and makeshift beds 
scatter the location sporadically with the injured occupying 
some. Various physicians and healers move about tending to 
patients and their medical problems.

A Cold Obsidian Receiving Chamber~
   The atmosphere of this receiving room is somewhat stark, the 
thick obsidian walls emanating a distinctly icy discomfort. The 
shiny black rock that composes the entirety of this tower has 
been cut into large blocks here, shaped to form sturdy defenses. 
This room is rectangular in shape from east to west and the 
floors are composed of the same obsidian though cut into thick 
rectangular slabs. The aloof feel to the room is further 
enhanced by the neat segregation of plain furniture - tables, 
armchairs, footstools. A few banners and paintings have been 
hung around the walls depicting bland village scenes and some 
maps.

A Fortified Obsidian Sentry Box and Commons~
   This strong, fortified sentry box is well furnished, the 
interior somewhat accommodating. The walls are composed of 
thick, brutish chunks of obsidian and this box has been 
manufactured as a one room extension on the western side of the 
main tower, jutting out watchfully. Cut into the walls at 
intervals are thin arrow slits, a stretching view of Harithilien 
spreading out into the distance. A variety of furniture has been 
positioned along the sturdy walls; armchairs circling tables as 
well as a selection of crates, boxes, shelves and paintings 
decorate the stark interior of this obsidian sentry box. 
   A variety of soldiers clad in both bronze and fine black 
leather clothing mill around the area, some on duty at the arrow 
slits, others conversing in murmurs around tables.

where the ceiling is so high thrust into darkness. Only one or 
two torches line this corridor of obsidian and dust and cobwebs 
accumulates in most of the skirting and corners. There is a 
distinctly uneasy feel to this area. A simple wooden staircase

Only a few torches sputter from their sconces at intervals along 
the walls on high, casting a myriad of flickered shadows onto 
hanging cobwebs and dust that accumulate in the darker regions of 
the cold hall. There is a distinctly uneasy feel to this place.

A Vast, Obsidian Barracks~
   Long, wide and spartan, this barracks is kept in an impeccable 
state of cleanliness. Formed of solid blocks of obsidian stone 
which seems to eat any light shone upon it, the mortar work 
boasts a masters hand, with near seamless joints between blocks 
of stone and the merging of wall, ceiling and floor. Scores of 
bunks line the walls, each given a modicum of privacy by the 
black walls which extend outwards at the sides, forming a triple 
walled room for each occupant. At the southern edge of this long 
hall a wide archway leads into a broad room, while a small, 
curving stair rises over, leading upwards.

ornate, bronze lamps which have been mounted onto the walls, 
though the dark stone seems to eat at the light, making the 
environ dim and somber. Kept in a constant state of cleanliness, 
every bedsheet has been smoothed and tucked, and no debris litter

A Modest, Comfortable Obsidian Commons~
   This tall obsidian chamber is squared, somewhat large in size 
but stretching high up into the rest of the tower forming silky 
vaults of shadow and cobweb. A few slitted windows have been 
fashioned into the thick fortified blocks of obsidian that only 
just look out onto the northern ends of Market Square. Pieces of 
comfortable furniture have been positioned in the center of the 
commons to leave sufficient spaces around the edges to move to 
and from the surrounding rooms. The atmosphere is quite 
pleasant, relaxed and comfortable - as much as its context may 
allow. A number of rugs and mats have been laid down 
decoratively.

   This sleeping area emits a distinct feeling of comfort and 
while it is rather modest in size, it stretches in a rectangular 
form from north to south. The walls are fashioned of thick 
obsidian blocks though in places occupants have decorated their 
exterior with banners, paintings and the like. Similarly, 
personal items are set nearby including plush rugs, stools, 
crates and bins. Beds are set behind three-piece black walls for 
some partial privacy. The ceiling of this room cannot be seen,

The Center of a Vast, Filthy Encampment~
   This camp is vast, stretching through the forests and 
spreading like a disease. The encampment is mostly composed of 
tattered oily tents the color of tar, each normal tent fitting no 
more than three or four orkin. The center of the camp rises in a 
host of larger yet still oily canvas tents, torn black standard 
flags bearing a garish white crown. Larger Orcs and Uruk-Hai 
mostly dominate the population of this camp, they living in a 
mixture to form this brutish warforce. 
   Thick logs have been hardened and sharpened then bound 
together to form a secure outer perimeter or palisade. There are 
no entrances here.

stretch high into the tower's upper floors. Here, the ceiling is 
only just visible in the shadows, elaborate vaults forming there 
where cobwebs and dust may gather. There is a discomforting feel

respectable enough to entertain a small number of people quite 
comfortably. Its off-white walls are adorned by several hunting 
trophies-- the head of a mangy old wolf, a dull iron shield, and 
a stuffed falcon in flight-- with a single, shuttered window set 
in the southern wall to let in some light. Additional light 
filters through hazy, oil lamps, two mounted on both the northern 
and eastern walls. To the west there is a sturdy oaken door with 
a brass handle and lock. A wooden trapdoor has been built into 
the ceiling near the western door, a rope cord dangling from it, 
weighted by a small sphere of wood.

   This is a rather roomy cave, cutting into a natural cavity of 
the mountain from another cave in the north. The shape is 
somewhat oval, the north arrow point created with pick-axes. 
There are wide shelves here and a large stack of furs as a nest 
with a large stone slab for a table. A murky smell lies about, a 
reminder of badly aged meat and black-bloods. An iron-reinforced 
thick oak door leads north and is hung with an impressive lock as 
well as a large sliding bolt that goes into the rock. On the 
eastern wall several crude iron 'halters' have been fastened 
ontothe wall, with heavy iron chains and manacles attached to 
them. Several cracks, the width of a hand lie in the south end, 
and along its floor - telltales of other natural caves deeper 
inside the rock.

ceiling is roughly carved with huge beams crisscrossing it and 
shuring it up. The walls are white-washed and fend off the damp 
and dust. The cold stone floor is covered with clean rushes and 
shelving and cabinets line the walls. A battered old lantern 
swings from a ceiling beam providing uneven light to ward off the 
dark of the room.

Interlocked Caves~
   A few interlocked sections of natural caves that have been 
worked with axe and pick to be usable, have been set with 
shelves, barrels and some filthy nests to be usable for storage 
and sleep. On the west wall, a large flat section carries the 
only real decoration in the form of a simple marking in the form 
of a barrel-shaped cage. The air is warm from fires in caves 
below and carries some smell of orkins inhabiting them - they are 
both dirty and disorganised.

Sloping Cave~
   This fairly large natural cage slopes a quarter downwards from 
the west, and there are steps cut in the grey rock to make 
passage easier - and quite a few suitable places have been very 
crudely flattened by stone cutters to allow shelves, crates and 
barrels to stand in a somewhat stable way on the injured rock. 
Much of the inner surface of this cave are natural and untouched 
by pick or spit, and a species of moss have one grown here 
enthusiastically but the change of climate have killed it slowly 
causing most of this room to look painted in a brown-red hue. 
Warm air, smell and sounds of orkin comes in from the west.

A Crude Tunnel~
   Cut deeply and crudely into the rock of the mountainside, this 
tunnel is very rudimentary and its floor is gravel and debris 
left over from its construction. To the south it opens up to a 
broad shelf on the mountainside where the cold mountain air seeps 
in and there are openings broken in both sides to natural 
cavities in the stone to both sides. Lining the uneven walls are 
simple shelves made from big, flat stones.

Spacious Vault~
   This sizable natural cave have been reached through an crude 
tunnel to the west, its walls sloping in from the sides to almost 
lean in on each-other forming a very triangular shaped inner 
ceiling with soft curves. Fairly incompetent hands have cut a 
very simple mark of a barrel-shaped cage above the entrance. To 
make a floor the builders have been filled up to a roughly even 
level across the cave with recently broken stone-shards, a true 
horror to naked feet. Crude stone benches, slabs and shelves 
have been set out in the cave - allowing for easy storage and a 
fireplace is set against the north wall.

A Warm And Gloomy Cave~
   Many workers have used this area; and the forge, burning of 
timber, tanning of furs and other work created a smoke that have 
risen as high as possible and somewhat obfuscated the uneven 
ceiling. In the middle of this cave lies a fire-pit that often 
are ablaze, the repeated fires burned here making the air warm 
and dry. The smell is horrible - with tanning fluids, burnt oil 
and coal as well as orkin sweat being the largest contributors to 
the odor. The spacious cave holds a multitude of shelves and 
crates to store tools and goods. Several openings in the walls 
have been made to reach other rooms that are used for storage.

Haradrim Trueblood Launchpad~
   Hello! Welcome and thank you for choosing to play a Haradan 
character within the Spire fortress of Egthela! You will shortly 
arrive in the servants quarters of the tower of the Reflected 
Moon Clan, a company of nefarious slavers bent upon enslaving 
Gondorians and Northmen to sell for profit. More information 
about this back story can be found both on the forums and our 
website. You will now be taken to a pre-game shop, where you 
will be able to buy additional clothing and other such items that 
your character may have brought with them to the tower. In order 
to do this, please either #BCHOOSE PLAINSMAN, CHOOSE CITYFOLK#0 
or #BCHOOSE FARMER#0 depending upon your background. You will 
then be taken to a shop which will carry a number of different 
items appropriate to your background.

Haradrim Cityfolk Pre-Game Shop and Set Up Area~
   Roughly a quarter of all Haradrim are known as city folk, and 
inhabit the three major cities of Haradwaith; Jah'Anshah, Teymour 
and Behd'ad. These three cities are organised, policed and 
managed by three separate organisations known as a Cabal; a 
collection of merchants, traders and notable citizens of the city 
who decide on the running of the polis. The Jah'Anshah, Teymour 
and Behd'ad Cabals simultaneously compete and co-operate with one 
another, trying to undermine the councilors of each others 
cabals, introduce spies, make lucrative trading deals, join 
forces to exclude one of the other cities, or combine together to 
wield their political power against the lords of the farmers. 
The Cabals are essentially representative democratic 
organisations, though rather than being representative of popular 
opinion, are of wealth and power. When you are ready type 
#BENTER GAME#0 to be moved to the Haradrim tower in Egthela.

Haradrim Farmer-Tribes Pre-Game Shop and Set Up Area~
   The region between the Endless Sea and Alborz mountains 
contains some of the most fertile soil in Middle Earth, 
especially about the deltas of the rivers Jah, Tey, and Behd. It 
is around these areas that extensive farms have been established, 
irrigated with technology taken from the Numenoreans of old and 
well managed by the farmer segment of Haradrim society. Rather 
than simply refer to members of the peasantry, the group includes 
the landed aristocracy of the Haradrim, which wield enormous 
influence and power with their ownership of the land and 
provision of food for the cities. Like plains dwellers, farmers 
are split in to numerous tribes, based upon ownership of 
traditional farming lands. The leader of each tribe is 
considered of privileged status, effective lord of his or her 
lands (females have been known to become the head of a tribe, 
though it is rare). When you are ready, please type #BENTER

On Rickety, Sloped Scaffolding Leading Round the Tower~
   This section of the scaffolding is reasonably rickety and 
leads up and around the so far constructed tower at a reasonably 
steep slope for the workmen here to access higher parts of the 
construction process. Shouts can be heard at all times, the 
workmen slaving away throughout the day: chiseling, carving, 
sawing, nailing, riveting. Large blocks of obsidian are always 
being shifted up on ropes and the smaller ones carried by workmen 
up and down the area here.

Busy Scaffolding Around an Obsidian Tower~
   The scaffolding here becomes somewhat more sturdy and while 
there is still a steady stream of people passing constantly on 
both sides, it seems to have become somewhat less hectic than the 
sections below. People hauling obsidian stone, packs of mortar, 
tools, wood and so forth make their way along here to their 
various working destinations. The tower rises up to the north 
and west of here though to see the top at this point, one would 
have to strain their neck. Far below Market Square can be seen.

Busy Wood Scaffolding Snaking Around the Tower~
   To the south the scaffolding here snakes west and around the 
tower. The wood composing the walkway is somewhat more sturdy 
than the lower levels, probably due to the high rate of traffic 
that passes by on either side - people with work tools, raw 
materials such as wood, obsidian and mixed mortar as well as 
crates of leather strappings, nails, picks, spades, sandpaper and 
a whole host of other building instruments. 
   A small door is set here in the western obsidian wall.

   This room is somewhat large, rounded, and entirely constructed 
of obsidian blocks. Several workers and craftsmen use this 
comfortable place as a workshop, fashioning their blocks of 
obsidian, extracting deficiencies in the stone, fixing their 
tools, sanding and shaping wood, creating mosaics, paintings, 
murals and so forth. A large circular hole about the height of a 
man is set high up on the right wall here as a rather adequate 
vent for loose material. In addition there are numerous bins 
lining the walls where workmen may deposit excess waste. A few 
comfortable chairs and sofas are set around the area for those 
who wish to break.

well as tools hacking, slashing, sanding, banging on various 
materials.

On a Wooden Platform Far Above Market Square~
   This platform, whilst rather sturdily built, towers far, far 
above Market Square below, the people there like little ants. 
The tower here has progressed to exceeding heights and still it 
grows above, higher. Other sets of scaffolding shoot out from 
this platform and around the tower again where workmen continue 
to refine blocks and mortar that have already gone into the 
tower. The heavy thud of many tools is always to be heard as 
well as the shouting and yells that accompanies the heavy labor 
here.

A Spacious Workshop~
   This workshop is lined with shelves, counters, workbenches, 
bins and crates, all usually covered with various pieces of 
equipment. The area tends to be somewhat dusty and the amount of 
waste material that's found is substantial in places. The room 
is spacious enough for two or three craftsmen to work on projects 
at the same time and stretches in a rectangular fashion from 
south to north from the door. The walls have been washed with a 
deep gray, giving the place a Spartan and stark atmosphere. A 
small and battered lantern swings from a hook in the ceiling.

A Filthy, Sludge-Filled Chute~
   This is little more than a (if one would dare breathe in this 
surrounding) foul-smelling, goblin-sized chute. The filth gives 
the air a humid quality, and the sludge pours from the rusting 
grate above to the dark depths below.

A Large, Carved Out Oval Recess~
   A sturdy plank door with a heavy lock separates this roughly 
oval shaped recess from the Hollow to the east. It is similarly 
constructed; the walls and floor consisting of compacted litter, 
and waste which makes up the greater heap. The musky smell of 
body odor mixes in with the stank of decay here, likely due to 
the numerous crude sleeping pallets and makeshift beds strewn 
about. In the northwest corner in a crude iron stove, its 
chimney is a jerry-rigged setup of salvaged materials, assumingly 
from the surrounding heap. When in use smoke curls out from 
various holes to cloud over the domed ceiling. In the southern 
wall is a small, circular door made from what once appears to 
have been a wagon wheel.

A Comfortable Reception Area~
   The walls of this large room are made from neatly set white 
stone blocks. The floor is the native black stone sanded and 
polished to a high shine. The oak paneled ceiling is supported 
by thick heavy beams. Three shiny copper lanterns swing from 
each thick beam, throwing warm light across the large, brightly 
lit room. Four rooms lead off to the east, west, south and up. 
A narrow stone staircase leads up to a thick oak door.

   This small building is made of cheap, thin wood planking and 
is no more than one room. A shelf lined with jars and other 
supplies lines one wall of the building and a marble table 
dominates the room. A few makeshift cots line the perimeter of 
the room, and a stove huddles in the corner, piping going up 
through a hole in the ceiling. Although the building itself is 
in poor shape, the room looks to be recently cared for and 
reorganized, a clever layout making the most of the lacking 
space.

drilled into the center of the highly polished black stone floor. 
Seated upon a wide oak base a narrow post holds a ceramic bowl 
from which a thin trough leads from the bowl to the hole in the 
floor. A large chair sits in the center of the room beside the 
odd looking gizmo. A long table sets against a wall holding an 
assortment of strange looking gripping tools and knives. Curved 
needles are laid out carefully along side spools of thin thread. 
Jars of queer smelling substances line a shelf above the table.

scrubbed completely free of soot and dust. The black stone floor 
is scrubbed and dirt free. The room is brightly lit by the many 
copper lanterns lining the ceiling beams. A long stone table 
dominates one wall of this large painfully clean room. The table 
is laid neatly with the tools of a physician. Polished knives, 
saws and scissors shine in the bright light. Spools of thread 
are set neatly beside the curved needles. Shelves lined with 
bottles and jars of indeterminable contents cover the far wall. 
Two large tables covered with white linens sit in the middle of 
the floor.

room. The oak planked floor is polished to a high shine, while 
the planked ceiling provides a solid barrier against the harsh 
weather of mountain. A stove sits in a corner of the room. A 
birthing chair sits in the center of the room and a bed with 
crisp linens sits against the far wall near the stove. A sturdy 
oak table is piled high with dozens of white towels and linens 
folded neatly on its dust free top neatly sits within easy reach 
of the bed and birthing chair. A shiny pair of scissors lays 
along side a long bone handled knife on a small table beside the 
birthing chair.

   Entrance through the wide oak door on reveals a shop with 
hardwood floors and very clean walls of warm brown wood. The 
simple pine counter sits at the back of the store, with a variety 
of armor pieces in various shelves distributed along the walls. 
A number of stands line the left and right sides of the store: 
however, a clear line of walking is provided between the counter 
and the exit into the marketplace. A separate, unobstrusive door 
is set into the middle of the eastern wall. Two lanterns hanging 
from the ceiling provide adequate illumination even in the dark.

   In stark contrast to the outside of the shop is this simple, 
almost plain area. A book of receipts lies simply on the table, 
pages open for perusing at leisure. Supplies are neatly arranged 
in clusters throughout the room in preparation for actual sale. 
Lacking windows of any kind, only a single lamp in the center of 
the room permits any extra light after sunset.

facility for horse feed. Water troughs lead along the inside of 
the stable being constantly kept full by the small water tanks at 
either side of the sable. Large doors open into the stable with

   Two large willow trees grow nearby the wall, it's large bows 
casting a refreshing shade all around them including over the 
garden bench set between them both. A small cobbled path leads 
from the (west or whichever way you want it) around a small 
fountin sending water into the air leading towards the bench 
between the willows. There are a number of brightly coloured 
flowers growing in the numerous flower beds around the garden, 
all well tended and clean of weeds. A small stream leads from 
the fountain under the path and out underneath the wall giving 
this part of the garden a very peaceful and tranquil feeling. 
The garden leads to a northern door with the carving of a veiled 
woman while the door that touches the garden to the west is 
adorned with the carving of a striking cobra.

row. Large flower beds follow around the wall boardering the 
north of the orchard adding a great deal of colour in the garden 
from the small flowers growing in the beds. A modestly sized 
grass patch sits between the flower beds and the orchard trees, 
well kept and short with a small cobbled pathway leading over the 
grass past the orchard. The area around the orchard is very 
inviting and a relaxing atmoshepre can be felt about the lush 
garden area.

provides a splendid view of the front garden. The walls are 
likely granite underneath, however a veneer of pale sandalwood 
with framing and supports of red cedar has been erected. Several 
silk tapestries can be seen on the walls, and there is a broad 
portrait of a battle Haradrim battle scene, hung above the 
dresser. This room is clearly appointed for a child.

dividing the kitchen cooking area from the main seating. High

A Gatehouse At The Market Leading to The Numenorean Quarter~
   A well-built, brushed sandstone wall with parapets stands to 
the east here, a gatehouse between the Marketplace and the 
eastern quarter of the city. The wall stands as high as perhaps 
three men, and has two small towers at its perimeter with sloped 
tiled rooves. An enormous, ornate gate made of cast bronze sits 
in the belly of the wall, drawn by a sturdy winch of dark 
hardwood atop the wall. Upon the bars of the gate, a large 
plate, made of polished bronze, depicts a large fist gripping a 
lightning bolt. Many Black Watchmen man the gate - both atop it 
and upon the ground. They actively stop everyone who approaches 
the gates from the marketplace, and demand to see papers, as well 
as asking many questions. Wealthy or prominent citizens who 
approach the gate are fast tracked through while the rest of the 
din are made to wait. Nonetheless the volume of traffic is low 
and many people are turned away.

A Gatehouse between the Marketplace and the Slum Shantytown~
   At the end of the Marketplace, where the well-trodden but 
poorly shod path to the shantytowns begin, a gatehouse has been 
erected. A granite wall has been erected, about the height of 
two men, that funnels the traffic through a section only a little 
larger than a wide-gauge cart. A wooden gate has been built 
across - made from many different types of wood in various 
conditions, but effectively achieving its goal of preventing (or 
at least slowing) the movement of people between the two areas. 
Groups of Black Watchmen keep a silent watch over the crowds, 
frequently shutting the gates to traffic for extended periods of 
time while individuals are searched. The downcast and grim 
slummers who pass by this gate manage to do so fairly 
complacently - an attitude reinforced by brutal Black Watch 
beatings of anyone who dares to push through the gates.

across - made from many different types of wood in various 
conditions, but effectively achieving its goal of preventing (or 
at least slowing) the movement of people between the two areas. 
Groups of Black Watchmen actively man the gate at nighttime, 
stopping everyone who wishes to move past and giving them a 
compulsory inspection. Few people move through these gates at 
night, excepting handfuls of drunks and miscreants, many of whom 
are roughed up.

A Tidy, Bare-Walled Office~
   This small office has been set apart from the chaotic hustle 
and bustle of the hall, marshalling yard and mess and an 
unnerving silence pervades, all sounds coming in from outside 
muted by the stone walls, as if someone were shouting into the 
bottom of a well. Its walls are all bare stone, untouched, and 
the entire office seems as sparsely furnished as possible, with a 
desk in the center of the room, a chair on either side, and a 
coat rack to the right side of the western door. Light thrown 
from one of the lamp fixtures on the wall throws a halo around 
the desk and chairs, though much of the rest of the room is dim.

A Short, Stone-Walled Hallway~
   This short hallway connects the marshalling yards outside to 
the hall and mess. A locked door, its handle a polished brass, 
leads off east into a small office while at the end of the 
hallway, to the north, is the barracks hall. The walls of this 
hallway are unadorned and naked stone, though smooth and several 
lamps have been screwed to them to provide more than adequate 
lighting. The oaken door to the south leads back outside and 
into the marshalling yard, and sometimes shouts can be from that 
direction, or the clank of iron on iron and wood on wood.

A Broad Living Area~
   The hallway here leads into a broad living area lit by bright 
scones and centered by a large battered table. Many off duty 
mercenaries are all scattered around here, some sharing 
embellished tales of battle and glory, others sinking tankards or 
belting out ditties with their equally drunk mates. Against the 
northern wall, a few comfortable looking chairs lay facing a 
large red brick fireplace.

A Cramped Mess Hall~
   This mess hall has been made cramped by clutter: tables have 
been pushed into the vaguely rectangular, stone-walled room and 
left in no apparent rows, several shelves have been tacked to one 
wall, all at radically different height, and a crate or two takes 
up residence beside those shelves at any particular time-- topped 
off with cooking tools and utensils, junk, raw meat, cooked meat: 
a motley bunch of things that have no place elsewhere in the 
barracks. The western doorway leads back into the sleeping hall 
and two lamps have been bolted to either side of it, and a large, 
plainly-made, candle-lit chandelier hangs from the center of the 
ceiling, often dripping hot wax down onto the mercenaries eating 
below.

A Packed-Dirt Marshalling Yard~
   Through the southern, iron-barred gate the street is visible 
and all who pass along it; a stool has been placed near the gate, 
where someone could sit looking out at the passerby for hours and 
hours on end if it suited them. The dirt yard itself is rather 
plain and unassuming: the dirt has been packed hard and even, 
though can be quite impossible in heavy rain, going straight to 
mud. A building takes up the entire northern portion of the 
property, the yard leading up to its oaken northern door and 
straw-strewn in that immediate area to keep any threatening mud 
at bay.

broke up by richly stained timbers that are adorned with polished 
wall sconces. The floors are dark grey stone, smoothed and 
lightly polished to allow the easy movement of rolled barrels and 
handcarts. A series of long shelves stretch the height and 
length of the back wall, bottle of various colors and sizes 
neatly displayed with the labels out.

scrabbling over the sticky and grimy floor while fungus slowly 
grows over the patches that are not as tread on as most. At the 
western end, a pile of rubble slumps out from the wall, composed 
of various large and heavy hunks of rock left over from digging.

bulbous, the walls beginning to close in as one moves northward, 
also with an increase in elevation as the ground slopes upwards. 
Above here, a deep shaft runs upward into the rock, the walls of 
it smoothed over and impossible to grip onto. Pools of water 
have formed here, fed by the trickles of water that roll down 
from further down the tunnel.

compared to further down its length. With the ever closing in

and scrap rock across the sloping rise of this portion of the 
tunnel, uncleared during its construction, making it difficult to 
move at any quicker pace than walking for fear of slipping.

though now is much plainer if still exuding a certain aura of

Gaol Station~
   This stone-walled building is flush against the stone of the 
mountain, leaving a somewhat rough and stony surface bare to the 
south. Stark and spartan save for a desk and stove, this room is 
swept clean and laid with fresh rushes. A shelf sits behind the 
desk. A stout door leads down with a heavy iron lock sitting 
beneath a large iron ring. The air is crisp and fresh smelling. 
The room dry and well kept.

Gaol~
   Neatly laid stone block form the walls of this dim room. 
Heavy iron sconces throw oily flicking light across the stark 
cold stone walls. Thick rushes seem to rustle and move. Three 
bleak iron doors sit in the walls to the north, west and south. 
A battered desk rests in the middle of the room. A carved, stone 
staircase, narrow and rough leads up.

Cell~
   This small mouldy room seems cramped and secluded. Dull 
flickering flames play over the dark walls at all times where 
three decently sized cages line the far wall. A number of 
shackles have also been attached to the mould and slime covered 
walls with a small gutter running through the dungeon often 
overflowing to fill the bottom of the cages. A putrid smell is 
heavy in the musty air of this awful place.

Down the Chute~
   The cramped sewage chute continues downwards into darkness, 
filth leaking steadily past and making the climb nearly 
impossible without aide; the sides of the pipe slippery with 
refuse and worse. Not too far below the sound of scurrying rats 
can be heard, and the faint echo of rushing water.

The Bottom of the Shaft~
   Filth and dirty water trickles steadily in from the chute 
above, splashing anything below and running off into a channel of 
water headed westwards through a small grate. To the east, 
however, there is a low tunnel in the darkness that seems oddly 
well-travelled and a foul stink arises in that direction, thick 
and heavy and almost intolerable.

Low, Stinking Tunnel~
   Moving east into further darkness, this squalid tunnel is 
cramped and low, making passage difficult and stooped for anyone 
of relative height. Trash and refuse litter the sides of the 
tunnel though the center seems relatively clear of debris and 
muddy water dips steadily from the ceiling. A powerful stink 
comes from further east, where the tunnel widens into a small, 
dead-ended room.

Small, Junk-Cluttered Room~
   The tunnel leading in from the west dead-ends here in this 
small room, cluttered with junk and trash and refuse. Piles and 
piles of all manner of things are heaped about the smooth stoned 
walls and the roughly hewn floor (uneven enough to make stumbling 
and tripping easy in the dark) glitters in torchlight, dimly 
reflecting slime and sludge. The stink throughout the tunnel 
seems to originate from this room: a stack of half-eaten, rotting 
corpses lies near the northern wall, in one corner of the 
bare-walled room.

The West End of A Small Haradrim Bazaar~
   To the east stretches a small busy market place. Gaily 
colored tents, stalls, and carts clutter the square. Shops dot 
the rock backed walls of the tiny square. Dark-haired vendors 
push brightly painted carts, while others hawk from painted 
stalls. A myriad of scents waft through the air carrying hints 
of the goods available. Swarthy men and women rush towards the 
east where the heart of the square bustles with activity. To the 
west the street snakes through the Harad Quarter of Tur Edendor. 
The market continues to the east, north, and south.

   This is the heart of the busy little bazaar. Tents and stalls 
of loosely-woven cloth are pitched within close proximity of each 
other, their owners shouting out offers to all who pass by. 
Vendors ply their wares as they haggle and barter with buyers 
dressed in the brightly colored clothing of the Harad. Scents 
and aromas waft in from around the square adding to the exotic 
flavor of the bustling market area. The bazaar continues in all 
directions. 
   A large pavilion has been setup here, speckled with a garish 
display of bright colors.

A Small Haradrim Bazaar East Central~
   The Haradrim denizens of Tur Edendor bustle about the heart of 
this exotic market. Laughter at well-made deals rings out across 
the square. Men and women in gay-colored clothing pass by to 
examine goods while bartering for a better deal. Shouts and loud 
cursing erupt at a deal going sour. The sounds of livestock add 
to the color of the chaotic noise permeating through heart of 
this busy square. The bazaar continues in all directions.

   The sounds of people chatting, haggling and yelling fill the
air, as does the pungent aroma of livestock and perfumes. Gaily
striped tents and painted carts fill the small area, making it
hard to walk in a straight line. The path continues on north and
west through the bazaar, while some buildings line the perimeter
to the south. A small shop nestles here with the rich aroma of
freshly baked bread wafting from behind the colorfully beaded 
curtain serving as its entrance.

area. Hawkers call out to passersby, and the occasional 
pickpocket plies his trade to the loud cry of a victim. A 
castanet and a rich baritone can be heard in the distance. The 
busy square continues to the west and south.

pickpocket. Brightly garbed vendors within close proximity of 
each other shout out offers to all who pass by. A busy glass 
shop lies to the north. Glass trinkets on a string from above 
the shop door tinkle softly on the wind as it gently caresses the 
colorful glass. The bazaar continues to the south, east and

the south and west walls of the bazaar are dotted with small 
shops. The tiny bazaar continues to the east and north. The

every wall are shelves of different depth and heights each 
displaying specialty glassworkings illuminated by the windows 
during the day and candles in glass holders when the daylight 
wanes. Further into the shopfront a counter stands, holding 
smaller, more delicate glass pieces also illuminated by candle 
flicker. A sturdy, iron banded, bright red painted door leads 
further into the building. A second, smaller and plainer door is 
off to the side, while a third wooden door leads back out to the 
street.

   This clean, white stone constructed room is of a comfortable 
size, but slightly cramped with the various large pieces of 
furniture and working spaces. Much of one wall is taken up by a 
stepped hearth and cooking area, that scents the air ripely with 
sizzling foods. A stone staircase leads up against the rest of 
the wall to a trap door that is between two of many reinforced 
beams that comprise the whitish wood ceiling. Noise issues forth 
from the far wall opposite the stairs where the pallets and 
belongings of servants are neatly arranged. Shelves line the 
walls above the servant sleeping places and onto the last wall, 
just shy of the door leading to the outer shopfront. Near the 
stairs is an iron-ringed wooden trap door that leads down into a 
cellar.

   Made of darker stones than the rest of the house, this room 
has a high ceiling in which a trapdoor to the above is set. A 
large work area has been set up, taking up much of the room. 
Without a source of heat, this cellar is very cold in every

smooth and even white stones of the walls and the whitish oak of 
the sturdy wooden floorboards give this small, but comfortable 
room a larger appearance. Several large pieces of furniture are 
arranged neatly throughout the whole room, interspersed by rushes 
that scent the room sweetly. A small window with bright red 
shutters lets in air and light, but not much sound from its place 
in the second level wall overlooking the street. A large, 
iron-ringed door is set into the floor planks leading to the room

An Efficient Workroom~
   The would-be plain walls of this room have been offset by the 
warm tones of yellows and reds, blended horizontally onto the 
wooden panels. Gaily colored rag rugs lay across the stone 
floor, nearly every inch of the floor. Shelves of threads and 
fabrics of all colors line most of the southern wall, built over 
a large workbench. With plenty of room to work and ample storage 
space, this room promises efficiency. 
   Set close to the southeastern corner, a trapdoor leads down 
into a storage cellar. A brightly colored curtain closes off a 
small doorway along the west wall, while a moon-etched door leads 
into a private room.

stars speckle high along the northern wall, piercing through the 
wood and to the outside, allowing stars-shaped beams of light in 
during the daylight hours. Several pear-shaped oil lamps have 
been set along the walls to help illuminate the bath and the area 
surrounding it.

shelves. The sound of haggling fills the air, a hollow din in 
the large canvas tent.

A Vat-Crowded Corner of the Pavilion~
   A pungent aroma fills the air, wafting from a few large vats 
of basic colored liquids which lends an almost stifling feeling 
to this particular corner. Swarthy-skinned merchants assist 
customers with their purchases, haggling over prices and filling 
metal cans from the vats of paint. Splotches of color and 
trailing footprints speckle the ground, evidence of the careless 
handling of paints.

A Broad Tent Smelling of Fruit~
   The western most side of this long, canvas tent houses a place 
for several crates and baskets. The floor is covered with 
thickly woven rugs, many of an elaborate design although showing 
their misuse by time and spills. The sweet scent of fruit fills 
the air here, wafting from the bountiful display of fruits, 
berries, and nuts that fill their different containers. The 
sound of bartered prices add to the din.

A Broad Tent Selling Dry Goods~
   The sturdy canvas roof and walls of this large tent are 
supported by wooden poles, harboring the edible goods within from 
the ravaging of the elements. Woven straw mats blanket the 
floor, catching spills left by the various dry goods set out on 
display. Baskets, jars, and barrels have been stacked along the 
southern wall, while the looser goods hold to a prominent place 
at the forefront. The constant buzz of customers' voices fills 
the air, broken only occasional shout of a deal well struck or of 
one gone awry. 
   A tent flap hangs to the north, exiting back into the bazaar.

A Broad Tent Displaying Fresh Meat~
   The strong smell of blood and livestock assaults the senses on 
this side of the wide tent, marking the wares before one can even 
look down at the various cuts of meat spread out on display. 
Several layers of thick canvas mats pad the floor, each stained 
with telltale splotches of browns and reds. In the farthest 
corner, a large stone slab has been set up for butchering the 
animals then and there. A few young, dark-skinned children 
circulate among the meat with palm fronts, swatting and shooing 
at flies that have been drawn by the musky smell of livestock.

A Neat Entryhall~
   This room is made entirely of dark-stained oaken planks and 
extends upwards a distance for a high roof. All of the windows 
hover several feet above the floor, out of reach, and are made of 
a wire mesh with wooden panels which can be opened or closed to 
the elements via thin, frail-looking ropes. The floor is covered 
with a dark brown rug. Near the southern doorway rests a sconce, 
in which a torch often sits alight. A tan pine-wood ladder leads 
north to a room above, which is not separated by a wall, but 
railed off by maple-wood. To the south a simple door with a 
brass doorknob leads to the outside, while a similar door stands 
in the eastern doorway.

eastern walls counters rest and a large table rises out of the 
floor in the center. The room itself does not appear to have 
seen very much use, else it's been very carefully cleaned in its 
day. A few small slits rest on each available wall near the 
ceiling for ventilation and light, and can be closed by sliding 
panels. To the west a simple door with a brass handle stands and 
a trap door with a rope covers the floor to the north.

nothing specifically foreboding about the room, it has the 
distinctly dank smell and dense air of a place beneath the earth.

and strips of leather upon them.

worker busily cleans and butchers the meats. Women silently 
prepare spices and tend small cook stove. The roof of the tent 
here slopes down but has a wide opening for the flu from the 
stove to poke out and allowing the aromas of the delicacies to 
waft through the market square.

Among the Mass Graves~
   This area spans several dozen yards and contains a number of 
large dirt mounds. It consists entirely of dark earth, and the 
borders are marked by a tall blackened iron fence. Every once in 
a while a few bodies can be seen piled up here, usually naked or 
dressed in shabby rags and lingering near a deep pit cut into the 
earth. During the day and early hours of the evening, people can 
be seen standing near one of the mounds honoring the fallen. A 
few granite stones guide one to and from the gates by the fence.

headstones of uncut, engraved granite. Grass and flowers stretch 
along between the headstones, cut and trimmed regularly. On rare 
occasion the corpse of a man or woman dressed in simple, neat 
clothing can be seen awaiting burial by a deep pit. More often 
than not people in armor and bearing the marking of one warband 
or another can be seen here, honoring a fallen comrade. The same 
black iron fence that surrounds the large mass graves to the west 
also surrounds this neater gravesite and granite stones mark a 
path among the graves.

considerably more adorned and well-to-do. Cut and trimmed stones 
can be seem among the rougher ones arranged about the gravesite, 
and range from marble to polished granite and mark the resting 
places of various men and women of the city. Often, pale-skinned 
individuals can be seen, some stopping to linger about a grave or 
two, others passing further to the north, where the graveyard 
expands in both size and grandeur. The black iron fence that 
surrounds much of the rest of the graveyard here is covered by 
green ivy vines, and granite markers walk a path through the 
headstones.

   The black iron fence wraps about and stretches off along 
westwards, marking the borders of the graveyard. It is decorated 
with green ivy vine and, unlike much of the rest of the 
graveyard, this portion of the yard's grass is kept a healthy, 
vibrant green and well manicured. Stone benches scatter about 
the area, set along the gravel stone marked by granite stones, 
and engraved, polished and quite often gilded headstones mark the 
burial sites of the most rich and powerful of the city. Farther 
north, then twisting eastwards, almost all headstones cease and 
in their place several large, ornate, stone sepulchres can be 
seen, guards stationed outside, their walls and doors decorated 
garishly in silver, gold and precious gems.

considerable effort, into the city-run graveyard. A black iron 
fence, quite tall and spiked at the top, encloses the entire 
area, most of which is dirt or stone save for the northern most 
east corner, of which is beautifully green grass and elegant 
stonework. A rundown wooden shack sits to the north, while a 
path outlined by rough stone markers leads east.

A Rough Rocky Trail~
   The wind howls loudly here as it blows through the jagged, 
upper, rock walls of this narrow canyon. The sheer rock walls 
are tallest here. They stretch towards the narrow stip of sky 
visible in this deep, needle like gorge. Rocks clutter the path 
and make travel difficult. A stunted tree grows at the edge of 
the path, shooting up from almost bare rock. Weeds poke out from 
between the cracks and rock walls. The path continues east and 
south.

The Mouth of a Narrow Canyon~
   The rock walls seem to box off here as the rocky path ends 
abruptly. Howling through the rock over head the wind howls 
loudly carrying a thin cloud of sooty black dust that disapates 
against the western wall of the boxed canyon. Boulders and large 
rocks litter the pathway with sparse vegetation growing between 
them. The walls above you in an uneven pattern, casting strange 
shadows as the sooty dust disappears.

Square Shaped Cave Lined with Weapons~
   Hacked into a rough square shape, this cave serves as a shop 
for a large variety of metal objects. The walls are lined with 
metal rings holding a lit torch, their light gleaming upon the 
weapon filled racks below. Leather clad blackbloods, mongrels 
and the occasional proud figure toting metal armor walk in and 
out through the large double doors set into the southern wall, 
casting greedy looks about the room and occasionally handling a 
weapon before setting it back. The cave is quite clean, by 
black-blood standards, the entrance usually kept open to allow 
ventilation. A large, flaming cage is chiseled in the northern 
wall, clearly visible to all who enter.

A Dank Pit~
   This rough room appears to have been carved out of the rock 
itself. Within a few feet of the doorway, there is a steep drop, 
leading down in to the darkness. On the floor of the pit, 
creatures of various shapes, sizes, and makes loom around, 
waiting to be retrieved by the Apostate and sold to the highest 
bidder. This is not a comfortable room and it leaves a feeling 
of uneasy tension to any that enter it.

A Circular, Chilly Cavern~
   Although spacious enough to hold half a dozen people, this 
back room is nothing more but a circular shaped cavern. Metal 
rings have been set into the wall, allowing a torch to be placed 
inside along with a few dull metal hooks rammed in between the 
rings, allowing an object to be hung or placed atop it. Cold, 
fresh air filters in below the door to the south, the soft dim of 
the various customers hearable.

The Tiger's Eye~
   Upon entering this shop the heavy scent of sandalwood is the 
strongest smell present, drifting upwards through the air from 
the always burning urn of incense sitting on the corner of the 
long ebon wood counter that dominates the room. Rather spacious 
in design, the walls have been painted a soft mauve color that 
reflect what light there is warmly back on those who enter. Upon 
each wall are double sconces holding large candlebras filled with 
long ivory-colored candles. Ebon wood glass display cases are 
placed throughout the room in a strategic manner to better show 
off their wares. The floor is made of solid wood, though it is 
scuffed here and there from a careless foot.

A Cluttered Workroom~
   This is a rather narrow, plain room. The walls have been 
painted a warm mauve, but left with no other adornments. There 
is a single window, very high up on the western wall that lets in 
a small amount of light. Hanging from the ceiling are two large 
lanterns that give out a considerable amount of light. The floor 
is lightly covered metal flecks and marked with heel scuffs.

intricate designs in onyx painted along the top and bottom edges 
of the walls. From the eastern and western wall, onyx-colored 
lantern hang from chains, shedding golden light on the rooms 
interior. The heavy scent of sandalwood lingers in the air from a 
hanging incense burner in the corner and the floor is made of 
dully gleaming ebon wood, without a single scuff. In the center 
of the room is a elegantly decorated circular mauve-colored rug 
piled with several onyx-colored pillows to sit upon.

   Rather large in appearance, this room's walls have been pained 
a deep indigo, almost giving one the feeling of being very deep 
underwater. Filmy curtains made of ebony silk spill down from 
the ceiling to drape around the bed that sits at its center. 
Medium sized windows sit in the wall on either side of the room 
allowing what light there is outside to spill inward. The floor 
is made of solid ebon wood, that reflects dully in the light 
coming from the two sconces on the eastern and western wall, 
holding scrollwork lanterns.

An Orkish General Store and Brewery~
   Carved out of the solid rock of the underwarrens, the shop's 
walls are rather roughly hewn and scraggly. The floor is 
well-laid with solid tiles of granite and painted into the center 
tile next to the door is a red cage with an open eye inside it. 
Many shelves and racks make up rows along the back half of the 
store, stocked with foodstuffs, barrels, and alcohol. In the 
front of the store, various wood crafted items sit on display. 
Large timbers run along the ceiling of the shop, where brass 
lamps hang down just above the rows of wares, giving off ample 
light for the various customers to see. A sturdy wooden door 
gives access back to the main tunnel outside and another is set 
into the wall behind the counter to the south.

furnishing and containers.

yellowing and dry, and the stink of manure lingers in the air

plain wood, of sturdy but not fine construction - capable of 
surviving considerable wear and tear, but clearly meant for 
practicalism and not aesthetics.

floor is paved with coarse stones and reveal the dirt beneath 
where the rocks meet. A few small ledges sit at intervals, made 
as resting places for lamps or candles. The room itself isn't 
sized very large, with only enough room for a few beds and sparse 
furniture. A large, low window rests on the southern wall, its 
shuttered opening leading into a small plot of dirt.

   This shopfront has been build sturdily and of pine, the smell 
of the wood still thick in the air and mingling with other 
smells: that of the city outside, the oil and grease of leather, 
the metallic tang of iron and steel. Its floor is sloped 
slightly due to its construction and at times balls of cord, or 
other similarly shaped objects, can be found pressed up against 
the eastern wall, or bouncing straight out the door and onto the 
street. A long, smooth counter runs a few feet run the western 
wall and behind it is a door; a padlocked trapdoor has also been 
set into the ceiling, and a wooden ladder leads up to it.

enough and capable of bearing considerable weight though a rough 
patch job in the far corner would attest to the fact that not all 
of the flooring is as strong as its strongest point. A tiny, 
iron-barred window sits facing the square and lets in some light.

arranged around it. With no windows, light comes from the lamps 
and candles set upon small oval shelves arranged around the room. 
The walls themselves, wooden boards stained a rich dark red, hold 
small delicate pictures, some of men in full armour others of 
suns setting over far away hills. An archway to the west leads 
to a small kitchen, a spiral staircase leads upwards a heavy 
door, while the arch to the south leads to the entrance, to the 
east lies a heavy oak door.

the walls, windows set in the west let in daylight and warmth. 
Benches and work surfaces spread along one side while two tables 
and a set of chairs rest upon the other. The stone walls have 
been given a careful layer of white paint. The large open 
fireplace lays to one side, a large pot hanging over it. To the 
east, an open arch leads to the main living room.

A Spartan Bunk Room~
   Kept clean and simple this room houses two lines of single 
plain beds each lining one side of the room, a single small chest 
resting at the foot of each one. A thin high window lies along 
the east of the room letting in small amounts of light. In 
between each bunk a single candle rests on a small shelf, giving 
more light to the long room. The walls made of grey stone with 
little decoration save for the few trinkets and pictures 
intervals display above there own bunk.

In the Yard Before the Townhouse~
   The ground of the wide open yard stretches east and west, 
black stone flags covering the yard. A high wall made of the 
same darkened stone surrounds both the yard and the manor itself. 
A small arch leads towards the houses double doors while a heavy 
iron gate leads out of the grounds. The stone underfoot is 
smooth and even, with no gaps or edges. The Building to the 
north stands tall on two stories, the font raised high above the 
back, letting rain drain back away from the yards expanse.

A Luxurious Bedroom~
   Set upon the upper floor of the building this room commands a 
view of the entire yard below, given from the large window set 
upon the south wall, delicate black silk curtain hang at either 
side giving privacy when drawn. Up against the opposite wall, a 
mahogany bed lies, dark drapes lying its four posts giving more 
privacy. Laying the floor a warm carpet of rich red and somber 
black hides the stained floorboards under it. Two elegant oil 
lamps lend more light to the room. Resting near a bookcase, a 
single table and chair rest, set with another small lamp.

   Resting to the west of the wide yard, the small stables lies 
against the wall of the townhouse's grounds, a simple wooden 
shack with several stalls for horses. The ground, covered with 
both clean and dirty straw, several bails of straw lie stacked up 
in one corner while in the other a simple chair and small table.

The Dungeon~
   Set underground under an iron trapdoor, the room is dark and 
dingy lit by several candles hung from ceiling, the floor laid 
with slabs of rough chipped stone, the walls uneven and edged 
have several sets of strong chains and shackles set within. A 
wooden ladder leads upward to the trapdoor, set near six foot off 
the ground. Rats and other rodents scurry and run in the dark 
confines of the small confines of the dungeon.

A Multi-Tiered Crevasse~
   This narrow cave-like space seems to have it been created by a 
mixture of nature and hard labor. While barely wide enough to 
accommodate the shoulder width of most humanoids at floor level, 
it widens as one makes the easy climb up the numerous rock 
shelves. However, it is never more then several paces deep. The 
top most tier, standing easily at the height of an olog, has 
enough space for several snaga to sleep side by side. None of 
the tiers have completely level floors rather being jagged and 
uneven, some more so then others. Clusters of luminescent 
mushrooms cast a dull greenish light over the space from their 
perches on the rock walls and ceilings, creating varying degrees 
of shadow which blankets the numerous nooks, overhangs, and 
cracks that make up this cave.

A Ramshackle One Room Shanty~
   This shanty has been formed out of an eclectic combination of 
daub-and-wattle, wood, stone, and whatever else could be 
reasonably scavenged from the streets and made to hold together. 
An attempt to brighten up the ramshackle structure has been made 
through liberal application of paint, however the rat-brown 
colour is decidedly underpowering. The door of this crude 
structure is, however, stout, secure, and looks as if it will 
survive long after the shanty inevitably collapses.

A Path Leading to a Simple Cottage~
   This short dirt trail leads up to a simple, grey stone 
farmhouse. The south side of the farm contains the various 
fields where the farming is done, and there is a short several 
foot wooden fence surrounding the property. 
   The door to the small cottage hangs from the jam broken and 
splintered.

Inside A Simple Cottage~
   This broad, circular room is fashioned of grey stone, wooden 
beams crossing the ceiling to support a thatched roof above. A 
few pieces of furniture dot the enclosure, clustered about a 
fireplace by the eastern wall. A stove of cast iron lies along 
the room's northern bend, a metal pipe leading fumes up and away 
to a chimney. A tall oak door leads to a room to the south, 
while a heavy door of polished pine leads west onto the yard of 
the cottage. One could leave the cottage to south. 
   Both doors east and south are broken and splintered.

Farming Field~
   Roughly the size of an acre, this field is large enough to 
accomodate a pair of crops, yet still be worked by a single man. 
A modest fence ensures that wandering animals can't feed from the 
crops, as well as keep the farms animals from wandering too far. 
One could enter a small stone cottage to the east, or walk 
further north into another field.

A Quiet Bedchamber~
   Small but comfortable, this quiet bedchamber, fashioned of 
grey brick, is moderately attended, set with sturdy, serviceable 
furniture. Shuttered windows on the eastern wall offer light in 
the daytime, a bed of pine placed just beneath them. The chamber 
is kept heated by the stove piping from the cottage's main room, 
accessible through a tall, pinewood door set along the western 
wall. 
   The door is broken and swings from its hinges.

A Ramshackle Shanty~
   There is little adornment to this simple, one room shanty. 
The rear end of the shanty is actually a hollow in the cliff face 
behind, the roof just higher than man-height. The use of the 
natural hollow is probably the sturdiest construction to be found 
in the place, as the walls built out from the hollow are 
haphazardly pieced together with scrap wood with moss stuffed 
into the seams in an attempt to keep the wind out. The roof is a 
mish-mash of wood with scraps of canvas filling in holes. A 
small hole, just large enough to stick an arm through allows 
light into the room, though only just enough to see by in the 
day, and can be covered with a flap of canvas that hangs from a 
peg above. In contrast to the rest of the building, the 
doorframe is comosed of solid, well hewn wood, and the door 
follows suit, thick and on heavy iron hinges.

A Circular, Smelling Cave~
   Although spacious enough to hold half a dozen people, this 
black room is nothing more but a circular shaped cavern. Metal 
rings have been set into the wall, allowing a torch to be placed 
inside along with a few dull metal hooks rammed in between the 
rings, allowing an object to be hung or placed atop it. Cold, 
fresh air filters in below the door to the west, the soft dim of 
the various orkin to the west.
