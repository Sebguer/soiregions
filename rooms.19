Polluted Morgulduin Flowing Over A Ruined Bridge~
   The foul water is all pervasive here; no escape from it, save 
by swimming up to the distant surface. The sulfur stings the 
eyes, but the vague shapes that can be made out here are those of 
the sloping river bank, and the occasional bloated, mutated fish. 
The remains of a stone bridge lay under the waters.

In the Polluted Waters of the Morgulduin~
   The waters of Morgulduin are rank to the nose, the smell of 
sulfur and refuse seeming to cling to any who enter it. While 
the current is not fast, it is discernible, flowing from the 
eastern mountain range, the black wall of the Ephel Duath that 
mark the eastern horizon, to the west. While not too terribly 
cold, the river is quite deep, and those not powerful swimmers 
run the risk of being dragged underneath.

eastern mountain range, the black wall of the Ephel Duath that

from the filthy waters to a bridge passing overhead. The bank of 
the river to the north is ragged and raw, too steep and torn to 
climb.

In the Polluted Waters of the Morgulduin~
   The waters of Morgulduin are rank to the nose, the smell of 
sulfur and refuse seeming to cling to any who enter it. While 
the current is not fast, it is discernible, flowing from the 
eastern mountain range, the black wall of the Ephel Duath that 
mark the eastern horizon, to the west. While not too terribly 
cold, the river is quite deep, and those not powerful swimmers 
run the risk of being dragged underneath.

Under a Bridge~
   The foul water is all pervasive here; no escape from it, save 
by swimming up to the distant surface. The sulfur stings the 
eyes, but the vague shapes that can be made out here are those of 
the sloping river bank, and the occasional bloated, mutated fish. 
Directly overhead is a broad bridge of yellowed bones and twisted, 
spiny branbles, forcing one beneath the surface of the water here.

Directly overhead is a broad bridge of yellowed bones and twisted, 
spiny branbles, forcing one beneath the surface of the water here.

In the Polluted Waters of the Morgulduin~
   The waters of Morgulduin are rank to the nose, the smell of 
sulfur and refuse seeming to cling to any who enter it. While 
the current is not fast, it is discernible, flowing from the 
eastern mountain range, the black wall of the Ephel Duath that 
mark the eastern horizon, to the west. While not too terribly 
cold, the river is quite deep, and those not powerful swimmers 
run the risk of being dragged underneath.
   To the west, the waters of the river flow under a bridge.

Swimming in to the Anduin wouldn't be a bright idea, even for you.

A Hastily-Constructed Dock~
   Thrown together with an assortment of lumber, rope and nails, 
this structure stretches out from the eastern bank, offering 
ballards for securing ships, but little else. Wide enough to 
berth perhaps a single large ship, this has clearly been put 
together by a military force, as the flags of Lord Eradan are 
posted in the four corners of the docks. 

A naval vessel carries soldiers and freight between the various 
military docks and Harlond.

A Small Side-Street off of Rath Celerdain~
   A small side-street winds its way through the buildings off of 
Rath Celerdain. The cobbles of the street are well-worn and the 
buildings along it appear to be residential in nature. Hanging 
lamps have been set at regular intervals along the street, 
providing a constant dim light throughout the dark hours. The 
bustle off of the main road echoes off the sides of the buildings 
and the cobbles.

   A cobbled path leads a straight path through a well-manicured 
garden up to the front steps of the house to the south. Rose 
bushes line the edges of the path and off to one corner under the 
shade of a tree sits a garden bench. An iron gate surrounds the 
front lawn and goes around the sides of the house towards the 
back. A gate allows access back onto the street and a brightly 
painted blue door gives access into the home.

A Short Foyer~
   Rustic stone tiles line the floor of the short foyer up to a 
simple, yet elegant staircase that leads to the second floor. 
The walls have been painted a warm cream color to accent the 
floor. Two cherry-wood sconces hang on the left and right walls, 
giving a subtle warm light to the foyer. To the west an archway 
leads into a formal dining room and a larger archway leads south 
into the living room.

   Large enough to fit a spacious table and chairs, this room has 
been decorated for formal dining. A carved cherry-wood 
chandelier hangs over the center of the dining table, giving off 
ample light. The walls have been painted a warm crimson color 
and polished cherry-wood boards line the floor. An archway leads 
back to the foyer to the east and another arch, concealed with a

room, giving off ample light. The eastern area of the room has 
been designated an office area, where a desk and bookcase reside. 
The remainder of the room is taken up with a large couch that 
faces out into the garden to the south. Large pane-glass windows 
sit on either side of the southern door, allowing for a great 
deal of sunlight to enter the room during the daylight hours.

white tiles, tightly placed together. The walls have been

A Broad Cellar Beneath the House~
   Spanning out beneath the house this cellar is surprisingly 
well lit. The walls have been finished in stone blocks and the 
floor with the same. Simple iron sconces hang on the walls at 
even intervals, lighting the way through the rows of racks and 
cabinets that fill the cellar. There is a drainage hole in the 
far corner of the cellar where a set of meat hooks hang. The 
only exit from the cellar is a short stair leading back up into 
the kitchen.

A Small Orchard and Herb Garden~
   The lots behind the house have been cleared out and a small 
orchard and herb garden have been planted here. The trees line 
the back half of the garden in small rows and closer to the house 
flower beds are filled with herbs and other flowers. Off to the 
western corner of the garden is where the tool sheds and bins are 
kept. The scent of growing plants and fresh compost fills this 
area of the garden. A set of glass doors leads into the kitchen 
of the house to the north and the garden continues on to the 
east. A greenhouse has been built close to the house, where 
various exotic herbs and flowers grow, protected.

A Huge Backyard Garden~
   Spanning out over a plot, this yard is massive and well-kept. 
Manicured trees dot the yard at random intervals and a dirt path 
winds its way through the garden past flower beds filled with 
various flowers and plants towards a clearing in the center of 
the yard where a garden table sits under the shade of an apple 
tree. Different types of ivy grow up over the iron fence that 
surrounds the yard, lending an air of privacy to the yard. The 
yard continues on to the west and a set of paned glass doors 
leads into the house to the north.

bathroom in a pattern of flowing water. A clear crystal 
chandelier hangs in the center of the room, spreading light

stand easily within it. The walls are painted a plain white and 
the floor is covered with cedar planks. Sets of shelves and 
hanging rods line the walls, all made of cedar as well. There is 
a small chandelier hanging from the ceiling providing enough 
light to be able to discern the colors of the clothing kept 
within easily. A single door leads back out into the bedroom 
beyond.

A Spacious Attic~
   Long boards run across the ceiling, forming the roof of the 
townhouse. There are two round windows, lending light to the 
attic, one at the front and one at the rear of the large space. 
The space itself is barely finished out, with little more than 
plank boards making up the floor and walls. While there is room 
enough to stand upright, the ceiling is not very high. A single 
#6trapdoor#0 can be #6open#0ed to lead back into the house 
proper.

A Small Private Stable~
   These stables are small, only housing a few stalls and a small 
exercise yard in the back. The stalls themselves are well-made 
and the animals within them appear to be well taken care of and 
maintained. There is amble storage for the tools needed for 
maintaining a working stable. The smell of the flowers from the 
garden waft into the stables, mixing with the scent of the 
animals in a pleasant manner. Lanterns hang from the rafters, 
supplying ample light within the stables day or night.

   With barely enough room for two people to stand side by side, 
this small and secreted stairwell begins straight out from behind 
the wall to the west, cold stone leads the way upwards in a 
circular motion around a growing spire. Only a few wrought iron 
sconces illuminate the otherwise barren stairwell.
