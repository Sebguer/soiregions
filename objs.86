a post-box application form~
A post-box application form has been left here.~
This is an application form for a post-box. What you need to do 
is take it to a location where you want your postbox to be, and 
then type #6configure post-box <direction>#0, where direction is a 
door which leads to the street. Next, you need to pick a name for 
your mail to be addressed to, using the syntax #6configure address 
<name>#0, for example, #3configure address bob#0. Once you've done that, 
assuming you chose a valid location and name, simply return to the 
post office and #6register postbox#0.

spectacles bronze-rimmed pair SPECIAL_POSTAL_OBJECT OTHER~
a pair of bronze-rimmed spectacles~
A pair of bronze-rimmed spectacles rest here.~
The frames of these spectacles have been fashioned from 
burnished bronze metal, thin like wire but sturdy. The sides of 
the spectacles curl severely at each end to fit behind the ears 
of the wearer and the lenses magnify anything placed before them 
for the wearer to see. Each perfectly-created, glass lens has a 
minute groove around the edging which allows the frames of the 
spectacles to fit gently around the glass. The pair is 
lightweight and delicate, very fragile despite the obvious 
careful make.
