fireplace cozy river-rock clay PLAYERNAYA STONE~
a cozy river-rock and clay fireplace~
A fireplace made of river-rocks has been built into the wall here.~
   This cozy little fireplace is made up of carefully stacked
river-rocks in shades from blue-grey to pinkish-red, each worn
smooth from the flow of water. They are chinked with clay that's
been fire-hardened into a ceramic sheen, sparkling like glass
in the light. The hearth is open enough to allow a bit of cooking
over the fire within, though it has obviously been designed more
for comfort and heating than anything else.

A dark-blue stained bar with silver rails sits along the western wall.~
   A long bar spans the entire wall of the room, barstools placed 
closely together to allow the seating of many. Stars of silver 
and gold are embedded in the blue stained surface, covered by 
thick shellac that makes the entire bar shine. A long silver 
railing, rounded in form, provides protection from drinks falling 
off of the bartop. On each far side, the bar fades into simply a 
hinged counter that may be lifted for passage into the space 
behind the bar.

A round mini-bar with silver railings sits here at the center of the room.~
   Making a complete circle with a small hole in the center for 
the tender to stand, this bar leaves little room for people to 
surround it. However, there is plenty of room to make the order, 
then find another seat elsewhere. The smooth blue surface of the 
bartops breaks only to allow an equally blue tinted hinge, to 
allow entrance and leave from the small rounded space in the 
middle. A silver railing makes its way around the bartop, 
sitting just below chest height of a typically-sized human.

a midnight-tongued, ivory-hilted flamberge~
A midnight-tongued flamberge shaped like a goat's head lays here.~
   Wrought of blackened steel, this flamberge was forged by a 
smith with an eye for the macabre. The image of a goat's head 
has been painstakingly worked into the weapon. The upturned 
horns function as the crosspiece, while the animal's snout moves 
out onto the blade and ends in lugs fashioned to look like gouts 
of flame a foot above the crosspiece. Spilling from the goat's 
mouth, a wavy tongue of whorled black and gray steel serves as 
the blade itself. A pair of rubies stare out at the world 
beyond, brooding from cavernous eye-sockets. The grip is carved 
from aged ivory, ending in a diamond shaped counterweight.

the base of a great white tree. The upper limbs of this tree are

them hidden by a placket of material, close the garment at the 
front; two deep pockets on either side easily accommodate hands 
or personal effects.

It was carved with skill but without flourish, and is evenly

swooping, mahogany head. Signs of prolonged use are evident all 
over in the form of scores, dents and numerous scratches in the 
finish.

diameter of the outer ring, lending it support. At the corners
of the outer ring, several small resevoiurs are sercured. These
are filled with oil and a wick that leads up into a bowl shaped
lamp chimney. Though simple in design, when lit this chandelier
lights the entire room with ease.

   Once made of fine brown suede, these gloves have suffered the 
passage of time with little dignity. Sweat-lines along the 
cotton interior and the way in which the knuckles have been worn 
smooth over time hint that they've seen more than their share of 
use. The fingers of the glove have been cut off about where the 
second knuckle would be. Through careful examination, the 
knuckles appear somewhat stiff and tough, as if something has 
been cunningly sewn between the layers of the gloves.

A star-etched fluted wine-glass is set here.~
   Tall and delicate, this wizard-etched wine glass was made with 
great care. The base is wide and flat, leading to a twisted, 
thin handle. Reaching the neck the glass gently widens, until it 
reaches the mouth where it dramatically flares out, continuing 
the twisting pattern.

a recurved shortbow with a handle of cherrywood~
A recurved bow, with a handle made of cherrywood has been left here.~
   Somewhat taller than the regular shortbow, this recurve has a 
very small string-follow, turning almost straight when unstrung, 
which indicates that a fair amount of strength is needed to 
string and pull it, yielding a devastating shot. The yew wood is 
stained dark-red, the nuance resembling the one of cherrywood. 
Shaped as an ellipse, thicker at the middle, but more narrow at 
the back, it sports a streamlined appearance. A long, narrow notch
is carved as decoration along the bow's belly, from the top to 
the handle, and then from the handle to the bottom. The handle 
itself is made of dark cherrywood, slightly thicker than the rest 
of the bow and carved in a fine, spiraling pattern, giving it a 
good grip.

a beaver-skin healers satchel~
A healers satchel of beaver-skin with an embroidered patch is here.~
   Soft and supple beaver skins, carefully fitted together makes 
up this elegant, yet very useful satchel. The flap is covered 
with embroiderry displaying a golden-yellow sunburst, with its 
rays expanding outward. It is encircled by athalas leaves, 
symbolic of the Fellowship of Healers. Standing in the middle of 
the sunburst is the White Tree of Gondor. The satchel is lined 
with soft wool to protect the contents. It has straps that 
attached to the rings at the base of the satchel, to allow it to 
be worn on the belt, or when tied together, worn over the 
shoulder or across the back. It closes with a pair of buckles, 
to keep the contents safely inside, no matter how it is worn.

An elaborately embroidered, rich brown velvet cloak with a hood is here.~
   This sumptuous, full-bodied cloak is sewn from lustrous, rich 
brown velvet. It falls to the ankles in heavy swirls of solid 
fabric, its panels flaring from a smooth neck seam. Its hood is 
roomy and wide, and its clasp is ornate and strong. The garment 
is, overall, luxurious and exquisitely crafted. Embroidered on 
the back is a scene depicting Rath Gil in Osgiliath. A large 
number of orcs swarm the street, locked in combat with 
battle-weary soldiers. Just beyond the orcs, in the front, can 
be seen many mounted Ecthel, galloping their armored horses 
through the throng, cutting the enemy down. Such fine detail has 
been put into this scene that the walls looks as if they could 
crumble off the cloak, and one of the orcs might slash right 
through the person viewing it. In the lower corner, written in 
very small letters, is: The Ecthel join the Fight. Scene one of 
four. Brenna.

   This sumptuous, full-bodied cloak is sewn from lustrous ivory 
velvet. It falls to the ankles in heavy swirls of solid fabric, 
its panels flaring from a smooth neck seam. Its hood is roomy 
and wide, and its clasp is ornate and strong. The garment is, 
overall, luxurious and exquisitely crafted. Embroidered on the 
back is a scene depicting the Plaza of the Sun in Minas Tirith. 
The plaza is choked with cheering people, the ivory fountain and 
walls blending in seamlessly with the color of the cloak. In the 
foreground is an impeccably armored man astride a pure white, 
armored stallion. His shoulders are set back imperiously, his 
hand raised in a motion to order the movement of the rows and 
rows of troops behind him. The atmosphere portrayed by this 
scene is joyously hopeful, echoed in the expressions on the faces 
of the cheering masses. In the lower corner, written in very 
small letters, is: Boromir leads troops to Osgiliath. Scene four 
of four. Brenna.

a stone statue of a man on horseback~
A large stone statue of a man on horseback stands here on display.~
   Made from white stone, this statue towers to at least twice 
the height of the average man. Its base is a long, rectangular 
platform, where on each side a white tree surrounded by seven 
stars has been etched. Atop the platform is large horse, covered 
in heavy armaments. The smooth stone appears to have captured 
the horse in a trotting position. Sitting atop the horse is a 
man, outfitted in platemail. In his left arm he carries a large 
kite shield, which has been engraved with the White Tree. In his 
right hand, which is outstretched before him is a large sword, 
pointing towards the gates of Minas Tirith. Resting upon this 
man's head is a simple winged crown, below which his visage 
stares out with an unnerving gaze. The statue is made in 
excellent detail and is a fine heraldry for Gondor.

A lustrous, winged, steel helmet rests here.~
   The top of this helmet is conical in design, coming to a point
at the center. A long noseguard leaves only enough open space
for the wearer's eyes and mouth, as the sides of the helmet
cover the cheeks well. The most noticable aspect of the helmet
are the two, long wings which flank either side of the face. The
midpoints of each wing are riveted into the helmet near the
wear's temple. The wings span at least twice the height of the
helmet. The wings and the helmet gleam in an almost unnatural
way in the light, as only mithril can.

A storm-grey cloak with elaborate embroidery lays in a soft velvet heap.~
This sumptuous, full-bodied cloak is sewn of lustrous, storm grey velvet. It falls
to the ankles in heavy swirls of solid fabric, its panels flaring from a smooth 
neck seam. Its hood is roomy and wide, and its clasp is ornate and strong. The 
garment is, overall, luxurious and exquisitely crafted.  Embroidered on the
back of this cloak is a scene depicting the ruins of the eastern battlements of
Osgiliath.  Sitting upon the wall is a massive black fell beast, its mouth open 
in a scream of rage.  Mounted on its back is a large, dark cloaked figure.  
The figures in the street are giving the wall a wide birth, looking scared and
downtrodden.  A lone, blonde man stands out from the crowd, striding towards the 
Witchking, reaching to draw a wicked looking spiked flail as he crosses the 
street. Some of the men gathered around watch this lone man with wide eyes; 
others keeping their eyes diverted to the ground, but all are struck by his
bravery.  In the lower corner, embroidered in Numenian-Tengwar very small 
letters is: Haoden fights the Witchking. Scene three of four.  Brenna.

falls to the ankles in heavy swirls of solid fabric, its panels flaring from a 
smooth neck seam. Its hood is roomy and wide, and its clasp is ornate and 
strong. The garment is, overall, luxurious and exquisitely crafted.  Embroidered 
on the back of this cloak is a scene depicting the top of the Dome of Stars in 
Osgiliath.  Upon the dome is a wondrously beautiful woman, dressed all in white; 
she seems to radiate light through the darkness around her.  Surrounding the Dome 
of Stars are nine dark cloaked figures, riding on the mythical fell beasts.  All 
are shown in flight, though the most prominent is poised to attack the White 
Woman.  In the background of this scene are the streets below, filled with an 
almost writhing mass of people, some locked in combat and others staring at 
the sight overhead.  In the lower corner written in Numenian-Tengwar in very 
small letters is: The Lady of the Keep.  Scene two of four.  Brenna.

as if sunlight has never graced its body. The majority of its 
bone structure is ill-defined beneath its chubby features, 
particularly the slight indentation of its chin. Small limbs 
ending in tiny digits extend from the child's chubby torso, most 
often seen stirring about without direction or coordination of 
movement.

a vivid portrait of a scarlet-dressed woman~
A vivid portrait is here, depicting a scarlet-dressed woman.~
   This portrait, done almost entirely in black, white, and 
greyscale oil paint, was obviously painted by someone with great 
skill and practice. The subject of the portrait is a young 
woman, perhaps in her late teens, with long light-colored hair 
and finely-sculpted features. She wears a mixture of sadness and 
uncertainty on her face. Moreover, she wears a shockingly 
scarlet low-cut dress on her body, accentuating her curves and 
feminine allure. The dress and similarly-hued slippers she wears 
on her feet are the only color to the painting, sharply 
contrasting the greys featured everywhere else. The girl herself 
is crystal clear and sharp, done with sure, steady brushstrokes; 
her surroundings, however, are slightly blurred, obviously by 
purpose, giving the dining room she stands in and all the 
partying patrons of the location a muted look. This further 
accentuates and helps to convey the sadness and uncertainty of 
the young lady. 


   In the bottom-right corner of the canvas is a form of 
signature: a silvery-grey lute painted on a scarlet-red flag.

A surreal painting of a bouquet of wildflowers is here.~
   Bright, vivid colors and muted pastel colors clash in the 
middle of this painting. The left half of the painting depicts 
the left half of a vase of wildflowers in full bloom, ranging 
from wild roses to daisies to dandelions to field-flowers. The 
stems and leaves are rich greens, the flowers equally bright in 
their own colors. The right half of the painting, however, shows 
the right half of the same flower vase, only these flowers are 
wilting dramatically. Muted, dark pastels comprise the brown, 
yellow, and grey stems, while the flowers are equally dull. 
Several of the petals have fallen from the dead flowers to rest 
on the otherwise-clean nondescript surface on which the vase 
rests.

A painting of a couple embracing one another is here.~
   This somber painting, set upon a one-by-two-foot beige canvas, 
illustrates a couple locked in a tender embrace. The female, 
roughly a foot shorter than the male, has her back turned to the 
viewer, affording them vision of only her feminine curves, her 
raven-black ponytailed hair, and the half of her angular face 
that isn't pressed against the man's chest. The man, of much 
sturdier build than the woman, has locked both chainmail-clad 
arms around her. His face is scarred heavily and dotted with 
blood, though his long flaxen hair blows free, whipping along 
with his White Tree-emblazoned cloak in the perceived wind. 
Clues hint that this is more of a somber embrace of parting than 
a joyous embrace of greeting, ranging from the sober looks on 
their faces to the dead giveaway of the tears streaking down 
their faces.

A lively portrait is here, depicting a couple dancing.~
   This painting, done with oils on canvas, was obviously done by 
a skilled painter. The focus of the painting is a couple 
dancing, frozen in time in the middle of a dip. The female, 
roughly six inches shorter than the male, has her head thrown 
back, her sienna-brown hair spilling like a curtain toward the 
ground. Her soft, gentle features are cast into laughter. The 
male braces her in her perpetual dip with one arm behind her 
back, the other hand holding one of hers, with his baby-blue eyes 
peering past his scarlet hair to gaze at her face. They are both 
sharply dressed in blues and reds, and both seem to be enjoying 
themselves immensely.

a portrait of a lost little girl~
An oil painting of a lost little girl is here.~
   This oil painting has been done with deliberate, masterful 
brush strokes. The colors of the scene are muted and somber. In 
it, a young girl of perhaps five is standing in a crowd of 
people, reaching only thigh-high on most of them. Numerous legs 
walk past the girl, but due to the perspective of the viewer, 
their owners cannot be seen - only legs, skirts, pants, and 
shoes. The girl bears a look of overwhelming sadness, tears 
streaking her face as she stands in a sea of strangers, bearing 
nothing but a raggedy blue linen dress and a stuffed bear, which 
she grasps loosely by an arm, causing it to drag in the dirt. 


   In the bottom-right corner of the canvas is a form of 
signature: a silvery-grey lute painted on a scarlet-red flag.

a painting of a sullen young woman~
A painting of a sullen young woman rests here.~
   Painted upon a dull beige canvas, this portrait is of a young 
woman, perhaps in her late teens. The girl's head rests, tilted 
sideways, upon her arm, causing her golden hair to spill out upon 
the desk she sits at. She stares directly at the viewer of the 
canvas, past a rain-streaked window and a few feet out of the 
building she sits in. Her features, from her crystal-blue 
long-lashed eyes to her sculpted features to her full mouth are 
set into a mask of utter boredom.

   This hat has been made with mediocre craftsmanship out of 
linen, designed for fashion as much as to keep the sun from the 
wearer's eyes. The brim is rather wide as well as being quite 
thick, and like the rest of the hat is black. A silky grey 
ribbon has been sewn into the hats band.

a detailed oil painting of a couple~
A detailed oil painting of a couple hangs here.~
   Carefully detailed, this oil painting has been made with 
masterful strokes. As its focus, it depicts a couple at a 
wedding procession. The woman bears fiery-red hair, a trio of 
ornamental petal blossoms in it. In her hand, she holds a 
bouquet of similar flowers. She wears a long, daringly-cut dress 
over her body. The man's hazel-hued hair is cut to his 
shoulders, framing his weathered face. His sharp nose and 
strong, defined jaw contrast mildly to his genteel black hat and 
its trailing feathers. The cloak he wears about his husky body 
is clasped with the figure of an engraved horse. Beneath the 
cloak, he wears a black tunic, matching black boots and a pair of 
paints embroidered with the emblem of Gondor's White Tree. At 
his hip hangs a warhammer, and over his shoulder hangs a horn 
made from a tusk. They stand out naturally from their 
surroundings - that of a wedding procession and feast - and seem 
to radiate warmth and life. 


   In the bottom-right corner of the canvas is a form of

A sweeping $finecolor silk and velvet dress lays here.~
   This dress, made of finely, thick $finecolor velvet, hugs the 
body tightly to the waist before seamlessly flowing into a loose, 
flowing skirt which just barely touches the ground. The 
neckline, though modest, is cut straight across the chest, 
exposing the wearer's neck and shoulders. Fitted sleeves which 
extend from the elbow to just below the crest of the shoulder 
meets the neckline and holds the dress securely in place. Sheer 
lily white silk has been fashioned to cover the gown in a 
transparent cover, giving the dress a dreamy soft quality. The 
silk fits closely over the bodice, before sweeping into a 
diagonal hemline over the skirts.

Around the southern border of the village an irrigation trench has
been annotated in red letters. The lands to the west and south of
the village are annotated as lush farm lands with current farms marked
and the east and south show thick birch forests. On the bottom right
hand corner of the map is an elaborately drawn compass with the main
cardinal directions colored in red ink and the twelve other sub-
directions in blue, all outlined in a thin black line.

folds.

Even its clothes are carved realistically. The man depicted is a

A copper key with an ivory tassel has been left here.~
   This sturdy key is made of burnished copper stretched the 
length of a human's small finger. Its polished surface lacks any 
sign of age or wear, and it was clearly shaped by a gifted 
metalsmith. Hanging from the oval-shaped ring at the end is a 
fine, ivory-colored tassel made of linen.

An austere robe of thistle grey wool lies in a heap here.~
   This long, flowing robe is simplicity itself; the sturdy, 
comfortable wool is flawless and unadorned, the fit is close 
without restricting movement, and the seams are secure and 
expertly sewed. The arms are long and straight, hanging open at 
the wrist, while the lower hem reaches the ankles of most 
wearers.

A fine, ivory linen robe with subtle silver trim lies in a heap here.~
   This flowing, comfortable garment is exceptional in nearly 
every way. The fit is close without restricting movement, and 
the drape is regal without being flashy. However, the masterful 
workmanship and fine material do not detract from the classical 
simplicity of the overall design, the only obvious adornment 
being the narrow band of silver-threaded embroidery which lines 
the hems.

the deep hood. The back of the cloak has been embroidered with a 
circle depicting the White Tree in fine detail. A large fist is 
sewn before the base of the tree. All of the embroidery has been 
done with vibrant white, the threading contrasting sharply 
against the black cloak. Below the circle the numbers '2478' 
have been sewn in Numenian-Tengwar; for those that can read them.

not circular, but rather egg-shaped, with the wide portion being 
that which is fused to the shaft.

a steel claw~
A steel claw has been left upon the ground here.~
   Three, five inch, steel blades protrude from between four 
brass rings that connect to a beveled rectangular wooden handle. 
Meant to set firmly in the hand, like a knife handle, the wood is 
sanded down and polished. The users fingers fit easily through 
the brass rings provided while the blades seem to protruded from 
between the fingers of a clenched fist, giving the illusion of 
claws. Unlike a knife the brass rings and blades have been 
welded perpendicular along the edge instead of at the top. A 
small leather strap, with buckles has been connected to either 
end of the handle to fit over the back of the wielder's hand for 
a secure grip. The blades themselves have been formed in a 
elongated half moon shape with both sides sharpened. This weapon 
can easily be held in either hand and could prove quite 
formidable in the right hands.

   This set of brass knuckles consists of four large, connected, 
rings that one can easily fit any sized fingers through. The 
front of the knuckles have brass molded and welded to the rings 
to form blunt flanges, each flange resembling how a child might 
draw a volcano with chalk, with the bases forming at the top of 
each ring. The back of the knuckles, that rest in the wielder's 
palm, consists of a flat brass bar that has a short spar 
connecting it to each ring. Weighing about a pound the knuckles 
can easily be wielded by either hand and have a knob on each side 
that allows it to double as a cloak clasp.

sans clothing. As one goes through the stack they progress from 
suggestive to implicative to downright raunchy. There are no 
words or other elements that would detract from the debatably 
artistic content and the artist had some optomistic opinions of 
how gravity works and just how flexible the human body is, but 
otherwise clearly took great detail and time in his work.

a carved, cherry-wood cane~
A carved, cherry-wood cane has been left here, the wood glossy.~
   This long, thin piece of cherry-wood, a beautiful red in 
color, has been exceptionally-crafted into a walking cane. Vines 
and lilies in full bloom have been carved all along it's length 
in fine detail, the recesses carefully scorched to strengthen the 
details. The very tip of the cane has been encased in burnished 
steel while the handle is a perfectly smooth sphere of the same, 
high-quality metal. It looks to be very expensive and to have 
been crafted only by the hands of a very skilled master.

A slim, steel-bladed cane-sword has been left here.~
   This sword has a slim, steel blade sharpened only near the 
tip. The handle has been made of the same burnished steel though 
only a little more than three-fourths of the blade itself is 
useable as the blade nearer protrudes from a rounded encasing of 
dark red cherry-wood. The wood itself is covered by intricate 
coarvings of vines and lilies in full bloom and has been polished 
to a clossy finish though the entire piece itself has a somewhat 
awkward look when wielded alone despite the obvious lethal 
capability the quality of the blade attacked bears.

An ornate jewelry box fashioned of ivory lies here.~
   Lavish in appearance, this jewelry box is ashen white, a color 
achieved by the flawless quality of ivory it is carved from. 
With sloping sides and rounded edges it is adorned with gold and 
silver trim, elegant and antique in appearance. The inside, 
lined with crimson velvet that is utterly soft, is divided into a 
series of compartments about half a finger deep. The box clasps 
securely in the front with an etched latch of solid gold.

An unstable wooden platform stands here at a haphazard tilt.~
   This rickety structure looks like it is on its last legs, 
holding together by a few rusty nails and odd bits of rope tide 
around joints. The boards creak in protest with every footfall 
upon them, and a small cracks run along several of the older 
boards. The topmost planks have several darker stained patches, 
presumably from blood and sweat, though it is impossible to 
determine for certain.

   At first glance, this appears to be a heavily used long-sword 
with blood stains. But upon closer inspection, it is merely 
rusted in various places along the blade, the edge. Being of 
fragile nature, this blade could break easily if not handled 
correctly, but it provides some fighting capability.

   This vest is made out of sturdy, iron ringmail, interlinked
into a snug fit. On the outside of the vest, thin leather has
been sewn and riveted tightly onto to the metal. The soft leather
has been dyed a deep, jet black, and at the center of the chest,
the pure white depiction of the White Tree wreathed by seven stars
has been fashioned. The leather itself does not add much more
protection to the vest, but makes the metal quieter and more
comfortable in movement.

years ago, and replaced with an old stick. Even the sides of the

A wind-up horse and rider has been left here.~
   Apparently a children's toy, though it could almost double as 
an artistic decoration, this object is made of light-weight tin. 
It depicts a horse and rider, obviously Gondorian in origin, 
attached by a narrow tin pole to an octagonal base. There is a 
keyhole on the back side of the base. When the proper key is 
used, a series of springs and cogs are wound within, so that when 
the key is removed, the rider and the horse gallop in 
synchronicity for any length of time between two seconds and two 
minutes before the propulsion winds down and it must be 
restarted.

A wind-up mouse has been left here.~
   This children's toy is made of tin, its likeness to a mouse 
achieved through the use of geometrically shaped pieces of metal 
welded together rather than by any intricate or detailed carving 
method. It is slightly smaller than the length of a man's palm, 
with spiraled wires jutting out at the front in representation of 
whiskers. The mouse-shaped casing houses a number of springs and 
tiny cogs and has a small keyhole along its back. If the proper 
key is used, it is possible to wind the cogs so that the spring 
sets, propelling the tin animal forward on tiny wheels recessed 
in the flat bottom when the key is removed.

cylinders, graduated in length to give the different pitches for 
every note and its corresponding sharp or flat. Each cylinder is 
highly ornate, carved with intricate flowers in bloom and a small 
sigil of the note it plays near the end. Brightly colored 
threads that are woven together in a tight braid string the 
cylinders together side by side. A small tassel in the same 
colors is attatched to the pan-pipe with a miniature bell, giving 
off an almost inaudible light ringing with every movement.

Otherwise, your bid will be entered for the amount specified. If there is
a buyout on the item, and your bid exceeds that amount, it will be
automatically set to the buyout amount before being entered, and you
will win the auction. Use AUCTION RETRIEVE to retrieve the item.

the stuffed, mounted head of a gigantic ant~
The head of a giant ant, large as a man's chest, is stuffed and mounted here.~
   Made of black chitinous shell, this insect's head is larger than
a grown man's chest. Its glossy, lifeless black eyes gleam and three-
foot-long antennae dangle from what could be called its brow. Long,
curving, serrated mandibles protrude around its mouth, each as long as
a man's forearm. The whole head has been dried, cured, stuffed, and
mounted on a wooden plaque for hanging on a wall. Under the head,
on a little bronze plate, is engraved "20 Urime 2477, Slain by Raeth
of Lossarnach" in Numenian-Tengwar script.

#6An OOC sign on SELLING has been mounted upon the wall.~
The following describes the syntax for placing objects up for auction.

#6auction place <item> <minimum bid> (<buyout>) <length>#0:

This allows you to place the specified item in your hand up for auction.
All amounts specified are in copper. Specifying a buyout for your auction
is optional; however, for most goods it is advisable. The buyout amount
must be higher than the minimum bid on the item. The length of the auction
is in in-character days; an item may be listed from 1 to 30 days.

Note that all auctions require a deposit fee made to the House. The deposit
will increase for longer auctions, and will be refunded to you upon a
successful sale of the auction; if the auction does not sell, the House
keeps your deposit. Additionally, all successful auctions are charged a
"House consignment fee"; this is deducted from the winning amount.

 > auction place vest 75 15
   (Placing a vest up for auction with a minimum bid of 75 coppers, for a
    length of 15 in-game days.)

 > auction place sword 325 375 30
   (Placing a sword up for auction with a minimum bid of 325 coppers and
    a buyout of 375 coppers, for a length of 30 in-game days.)

#6auction cancel <ID>#0:

This will attempt to cancel the specified auction; note that you may
only cancel your own auctions, and that doing so will result in the
forfeiture of any auction deposit you placed with the house.

  > auction cancel 85

#6auction retrieve#0:

Attempts to retrieve any coin or merchandise the establishment is holding
for you from sales, successful bids, expired auctions, and so on. Note
that you may need to use the command multiple times to "clear out"
everything that the House is currently holding for you.

 > auction retrieve

A large dark pupil allows a glimpse of the clouded lens and is 
surrounded by a thin, pale iris. Several inches of thick, fleshy 
cord dangle from the back of the orb.

   Floating a glass jar of viscous, clear fluid is the lower jar 
of a sizeable creature. The flesh on the chin is rust-colored 
and hairless, portions carefully peeled back and pinned to reveal 
a thin layer of fat, and a thick layer of muscle over a large, 
solid bone. On the top surface of the jaw are tiny teeth rising 
in sharp, pointed triangles, multiple rows of them in an 
alternated pattern behind the first row, as if unfolding from the 
interior of the jaw to replace those above. It appears that two 
to three rows of teeth could be in use by the creature at a time.

   A capped glass jar of viscous, clear fluid holds the severed 
forepaw of a man-sized beast. The flesh of the paw is 
rust-colored and hairless, severed at the forearm to preserve the 
wrist-joint and ligaments. Clearly more of a paw than a hand, 
the thumb is short and less functional, similar to a raccoon. 
Thick claws cap each digit, extending a few inches in length to 
tapered, vicious points clearly capable of digging like a badger 
or clawing like a cat.

Some long, wickedly-sharp talons floating in a glass jar are here.~
   A severed claw floats idly in the clear, viscous fluid of a 
capped glass jar. The paw is covered with leathery black skin, 
the top-side coated in fine black fur. The stump of the claw 
reveals thin-yet-solid bones where it was severed, and portions 
of the flesh are excised to reveal fine and fragile bone 
structure with thin, powerfully-corded muscles. One claw serves 
as a heel spike, while four long, wickedly- sharp talons extend 
from the forward digits, clearly designed for impaling and 
slicing prey in its powerful grip. The hand structure is the 
size of a petite woman, but the talons are akin to a fistful of 
long knives.

Only the wings are preserved here, with careful examination 
revealing the thin wire used to hold them steady and anchor them 
to the rafters above. The flesh is dried and stiff, black 
leathery skin stretched over fine, finger-like bones, a fine 
black fur covering the forward edge. A single wing claw remains 
on the front of each wing, sharp and about five inches in curved 
length.

   This long, thin iron throwing dart is of an equal width from 
front to back, save for the thin needle-like point protruding

three sets of feathers to give it more balance during flight.

A wooden dart board is hung here, painted with a target.~
   This circle of wood looks like the butt end of a wine cask, 
painted with five concentric rings, each a different color. The 
center is barely two fingers widths in diameter and presents a 
small target even to a steady hand.

a twine wrapped dart board~
A dart board, wrapped with a coil of twine and brightly painted with a target is set upon the wall here.~
   This wooden dart board has had twine painstakingly glued in a 
spiraling coil on its front and then painted with five concentric 
rings of color, each a bit smaller than the one before, ending 
with a small red circle, less than two fingers widths wide in the 
center. The twine presents a more willing surface than wood 
alone and holds up much longer under the abuse of dart play, 
especially when using fine, heavy metal darts.

a jagged-flanged steel mace~
A polished steel mace lies here, six jagged flanges around its head.~
   A little over two feet long, this mace is made of a long, 
hexagonal steel haft with a handle of soft leather-wrapped wood. 
The head is round, set with six flanges, each about five inches 
long, radiating from the head to connect into the haft. They are 
pointed at the top, flaring out to the sides, and then another 
set of points near the bottom of each flange making it a brutal 
looking weapon. Each flange is cut out in its center, lightening 
it measurably. The craftsmanship is exceptional and is clearly 
the work of a skilled master, the weapon looks swift, strong and 
deadly.

a brutal eight-flanged steel mace~
A mace with eight pointed, brutal looking flanges lies here, made of well polished steel.~
   This master-worked steel mace is an octagonal bar, the handle 
a wooden sheath for the narrow, well tempered haft and wrapped in 
soft leather for an excellent grip. There is a starburst of 
steel at the top of the handle, radiating out from the haft and 
protecting the hand from blows skidding down the maces length. 
The head has eight flanges; each punched out in the center and 
coming to a fine point. There is no etching, no unnecessary 
decoration or complication to this weapon. It is clearly a 
peerless example of a weapon designed for its best possible 
function. Strong, light, quick and deadly.

A warhammer lies here, the steel head blunt curving into a sharp, curved point.~
   This one-handed weapon consists of a rounded oak haft with a 
leather-wrapped hilt and is about two and a half feet long. Half 
way up, a steel frame fits over the oak haft and secures it well 
to the head. The head consists of a steel hammer-head on one end 
and a curving spike on the other, arching downward. A well 
designed and well balanced piece of work, in a skilled hand it 
would pierce through most armor with a solid swing.

   The one-handed warhammer is about two and a half feet long, 
made of a round, solid steel haft connecting up to a narrow head. 
The handle is soft leather wrapped around a wooden grip, giving a 
very firm, comfortable grip. The head itself consists of a steel 
ball half the size of a mans fist from which two square spikes 
protrude each side, each spike about four inches long and coming 
to a sharp point. A brutal, surprisingly light weapon, it's 
clearly the work of a skilled master smith.

an elegant, blued steel warhammer~
A warhammer of solid blued-steel lies here, the head shaped like two eagle heads.~
   This masterfully crafted weapon is a little over two feet long 
and made of solid steel. A studded leather handle provides an 
exceptional grip, and a starburst steel guard at the hilt's top 
prevents errant blows from skidding into the hand. The shaft is 
rounded steel, about an inch thick, well-tempered, and very 
strong. The warhammer's head is elegantly fashioned into the 
shape of twin eagle heads, each facing outward. The artfully 
designed beaks form a pair of four inch, downward-curving spikes 
that come to dangerously sharp points. All of the metal has been 
blued, giving it a glossy black tint with a multi-coloured hue - 
like oil on water. It is an extraordinary weapon, one that would 
be expected from the most skilled of master smiths.

flaring out at the neck, the cheeks curving forward to provide 
better protection while the nose piece comes down a bit further 
than the nose itself, flaring out so it nearly touches the 
extended sides. The result gives an excellent level of 
protection while still providing room to breath and a clear view 
for the helms wearer. The whole piece is wrought of fine steel, 
cresting at the top, the noseguard and edges are all edged in 
fine, polished brass.

   This fitted greathelm is made of well worked iron, curving to 
match the head and covering the face completely. It comes to a 
crest in the front; curving up all the way over the head and 
presenting an angled surface to any blows aimed at it. A set of 
horizontal slits, their edges curved outward to deflect blows, 
give a narrow view for the wearer while eight vertical slits, 
four up each side of the angled face, provide acceptable airflow. 
It looks like it would be hot, confining and limit head movement 
but provide exceptional protection for the wearer.

claws are lifted. The fabric of the banner itself has been 
affixed to a pole of plain pinewood, about seven feet in length. 
The bottom of the pole is capped with a shaped iron head,

together in a small living area. A few campfires burn, the faint 
smell of food wafting in the air as well as the sound of nervous 
chit-chatter , a slightly-tense feeling surrounding the refugees 
here.

greatsword GOOD_QUALITY UNIQUE_PGERAINTMTBLADES tempered-iron silver-pommelled METAL~
a tempered-iron, silver-pommelled greatsword~
A tempered-iron, silver-pommelled greatsword lies here.~
   The blade of this well-fashioned greatsword is roughly over 
five feet in length, made of strong iron, and worked with evident 
skill. The quality of the iron is superior to standard pieces, 
possibly from several repeated tempering and a careful attention 
to the sharpening. A long fuller is born from the silvered 
crossguard, making this hefty weapon lighter and faster than it 
would otherwise be. The crossguard is made of what seems to be 
silver, yet harder, and engraved with a symbol of a sword and 
star. The hilt is long, to permit a proper grasp and leverage of 
the blade, made of some finely sanded, painted and varnished 
wood, further augmented with a tightly wrapping of leather cord. 
The pommel is also artfully made of the same silvery alloy of the 
crossguard, bearing a dull gleam and a hefty weight, which, 
coupled with the hilts length and weight lends this weapon a 
good, solid balance.

A watery-steel, gold-hilted bodice dagger lies here.~
   Made of watery steel and polished with exceeding attention to 
detail, this dagger has a gilded, ringed hilt. Closer 
examination reveals that the blade parts and serves as a scissor, 
sharp enough to cut most soft materials with ease. The 
crossguard is an outgrowth of the rings that comprise the handle 
and has been carefully made to allow the dagger to remain closed 
and secure. The work of a master, in no place the blade or hilt 
reveal the mark of any hammering or sharpening. Thin enough to 
be concealed with ease, this is evidently as woman's weapon.

   This polished silver ring is thick, and undeniably masculine. 
The top has been carefully flattened into a rectangle, while the 
rest that hugs the finger is perfectly cylindrical, making it 
easy to slip over the knuckles to take off or put on. Carved 
into the flattened portion is a tiny broadsword, reaching across 
the diagonal of the rectangle. Wrapped delicately about the 
broadsword is a vine, its leaves curved to protect the blade of 
the weapon. A single ruby lies in the exact center of the hilt 
of the broadsword, tiny in size, but the color contrasts enough 
to make it a meaningful touch to the ring.

halfway down the hairstick.

a hawk-visored steel greathelm~
A hawk-visored steel greathelm lies here, a chain aventail around the neck.~
   This finely wrought steel greathelm is curved to match the 
head of its wearer, angling in and fluting out at the neck. An 
aventail of chainmail hangs from the bottom to help protect the 
neck from errant blows and the top angles up into a gradual 
crest, helping divert the force away. Clearly well made of fine 
steel, the most distinguishing part of the helm is the visor. In 
the shape of a hawk in flight, wings spread, the head pointed 
downward and the wings sweeping back along the sides of the head. 
It is curved to match the rising crest of the front and top of 
the helm and slides down to leave a small gap under the wings and 
above the opening in the helm itself. The head and beak move 
down to cover the nose, the hawk itself worked in remarkable 
detail. The jaw and chin of the helm is worked in a 
representation of a dove, wings spread protectively to cover the 
cheeks and side of the head, looking up at the hawk-shaped visor 
that dives down toward it.

   This finely wrought chainmail vest is made of high quality 
steel links, interlocking into a double- layer chain mesh. Each 
link is particularly fine and well woven among the others to 
create a sturdy but light weight sheath of flexible steel. On 
the chest of it, about six inchest wide and four inchest high is 
a steel breastplate to fend off thrusts to the heart. It is 
wrought in the shape of a hawk in flight, swooping downward, 
wings spread. On the top of the shoulders are two round metal 
pins, guards that fasten in place over the leather straps and 
buckles that hold the armor in place and prevent them from being 
cut by an errant blow. On each is engraved the image of a dove, 
wings spread.

up the side, it also has steel knee cups, generally called 
poleyns for additional protection. The poleyns are shaped like 
the head of a hawk, stylized wings sweeping back in the form of 
flanges to provide cover for the sides of the knees as well. 
Small circular steel pins are set in place over the leather 
straps and brass buckles that close the armor down the sides of 
the legs, each of them neatly engraved with the image of a dove 
in flight.

Each of them is shaped like the head of a hawk, its wings 
sweeping back into flanges to protect the sides of the elbow. 
Leather straps and buckles at the shoulder and inside of the

the body. Over these straps and buckles are set protective round 
steel pins, each engraved with the fine image of a dove, wings 
spread.

A steel breastplate of plate and chain lies here, fitted for a woman and engraved with a hawk in flight.~
   This skillfully worked steel breastplate is made of plate over 
chainmail, lighter and easier to wear than plate alone. It has 
been custom fitted for a woman, one whos measurements would make 
wearing a mans plate breastplate restrictive and uncomfortable. 
The breastplate covers the chest and around the sides from the 
ribcage up while a double layer of chainmail covers from there 
down over the hips, reducing weight and improving mobility at a 
small cost in protection. The breastplate itself has been worked 
and etched in the form a a magnificent hawk, wings spread in 
flight, rising upwards. The wings extend up across the chest, 
the tips up over the shoulders while the beak reaches up towards 
the neck and ends in a clasp designed to attach a gorget to the 
breastplate. On the back of the armor is etched a dove, wings 
folded, turned defensively towards the wearer, its head cocked 
watchfully back over its shoulder.

a watery-steel, flame-engraved greatsword~
A watery-steel, flame-engraved greatsword has been left here.~
   This weapon is long and somewhat narrow for its kind, forged 
of high-quality steel, polished and worked to obtain a watery 
sheen. Two thirds of the length of the blade is traversed by a 
fuller, starting at the crosspiece. A detailed yet superficial 
engraving has been made, stretching by the fuller, depicting 
licking flames that seem to sheath the surface of the metal. 
Made with evident skill, when light touches them they seem to 
flow over the steel. The quillons are long and sturdy, forged of 
some silvery alloy, with two hexagonal pieces at the end, which 
adds security and balance to the wielder. The hilt is also long 
and firm, made of some hardwood, which has been varnished and 
painted black, and then wrapped in dark leather to insure 
gripping. The pommel is heavy and also made of the same silvery 
alloy of the crossguard, an engraving of a sword-and-star etched 
on the surface. Finely made, razor-sharp and with superb 
balance, this is clearly a blade of superior workmanship.

a black-bladed longsword with rose engravings~
A black-bladed longsword with rose engravings lays here.~
   The steel of this longsword's blade is a matte black, 
reflecting no light nor glimmer. It has been sharpened to a 
deadly razor's edge with threatening engravings tracing the 
blade. Etched in silver along the nightmare-black of the blade 
are twisting, entwining roses, each one having a harsh, seemingly 
deadly, point. The crossguard of the weapon is silver, the grip 
itself wrapped in conformed leather and shaped to a specific 
person's fingers.

   Made of a pristine, well-kept white linen and lined with black 
silk on the inside, this hooded cloak's folds billow about the

the white fabric. Similar embroidery lines the outside hem of 
the large hood.

The pale corpse of a pregnant, ebon-haired woman lies here, hands folded across her chest.~
   This adult woman's body is unnaturally pale, her dark ebon
hair contrasting with the bluish skin. She is arrayed in state,
in a black silk gown that covers her from neck to toes. Tight-
fitting sleeves cover her arms. Her hands are crossed atop her
chest, above a misshapen belly. She might look pregnant, but
the shape isn't quite right. Lines mar her face, revealing
the struggle her last moments without question must have been.

A bronze plaque engraved with a pair of cupped hands is fixed to the wall here.~
   Made of a dark metal, the most notable feature of this plaque 
is a pair of hands, held cupped together, palms upraised. 
Carefully designed relief gives the clasped hands the appearance 
of extending from the surface. Above the hands lie some bold 
sigils as a title, while below the hands are several rows and 
files of smaller sigils, each raised slightly above the plaque 
face. At the very top of the plaque is a small recessed 
rendition of the Tree of Gondor, the metallic leaves polished, 
and the surrounding metal blackened. Completing the bottom of 
the plaque is a twist of ivy, wrapped around itself to allow the 
leaves and vine to overlap.

A tapestry portraying a vividly-colored forest scene hangs on the wall here.~
   A detailed forest scene has been woven into the fine linen of 
this modestly-sized tapestry. The trees and ground boast vividly 
colored threads of green and brown, while the clouds and sky show 
equally vivid-looking threads of pale blue and white. A rabbit 
has been caught in motion darting behind one of the trees, and a 
hawk spreads its wings as it takes flight into the sky. The 
images of these creatures, and the detail of the flora portrayed, 
give testament to the skill of the maker.

   An image of the great white stone archway leading into Minas 
Tirith is easily recognizable to any who have passed through it, 
the skill of the crafter doubtless in the careful arranging of 
the linen threads. Beneath the arch, the iron of the gates hung 
from heavy iron posts have been rendered in meticulous detail. 
Tiny people wander in and out of the gates, every aspect of their 
expressions and clothing visible as they sidestep carriages and 
horses passing through the gates as well.

long enough to fit loosely around the upper arm of a full-grown

make a tight knot. In the center of the fabric is a large, 
black-stitched rectangle, within it a depiction of the stately, 
white tree of Gondor.

caparison UNIQUE_HEREN_CARNATALION UNIQUE_POFTYRIAR white red checkered crossed red lances barding TEXTILE~
a white-and-red checkered caparison with crossed red lances~
A white-and-red checkered caparison with crossed red lances lies here folded.~
   Reaching from the horse's neck to its tail and almost down
to its knees, this linen caparison is pure white, with appliques
of small red crossed lances criss-crossing the linen in a checkerboard
pattern. It's a stunning effect that is difficult to see except close
up. From a distance, the caparison just looks like red-and-white
checkering. It slides on over the horse's head, and stays on with
a clasp at the horse's chest, settling on with its own substantial
weight. Many yards of linen went into its making, not to mention
dozens of hours of applique.

   Made of a pale brown wood, this small box has been exquisitely 
crafted. The edges have been finely sanded to create rounded 
corners, and brightly colored swirls of paint decorate the 
entirety of its surface. The design of the box is such that the 
lid sits in a hollow in the top of it, resting on four small pegs 
that keep it in place and allow a small lock to slide into place 
with the appropriate key.

A masterfully-covered tome embossed with the White Tree in proud blue and white sits here atop the podium.~
   This book is as thick as large man's chest, and perhaps as 
wide too. The entire front of the supple leather cover has been 
tanned to a softness beneath the gentle touch, embroidered and 
dyed a proud, royal blue. The front of the book depicts stylized 
pillars rising on either side of the cover, small vines crawling 
up them, with the White Tree of Gondor growing proud, lush, and 
full in between them. Above the Tree, spread in a semicircle 
over it, are the Seven Stars. The Stars, The Tree, and the 
Pillars are all done in white to cast them in sharp, vibrant 
relief against the royal blue of the cover. The book itself 
seems to be composed of hundreds of high quality, vellum pages.

A formal gown of $finecolor fine linen, edged in fur, lies here.~
   This formal gown is far from any kind of everyday dress. A
dramatic sweetheart neckline, not too low, is edged in the narrowest
strip of white rabbit fur. The bodice is quite fitted, with stays
and lacings at the sides, each lacing tipped in openwork silver points.
It is set into a gathered skirt that flares to the floor. The fitted
sleeves have an inner fitted sleeve to the wrist, and an outer sheer
bell sleeve draping down from the elbow, providing a graceful movement.
The inner fitted sleeves and the lower hem of the gown's skirt are
also edged in rabbit fur, the skirt's edging being wider and more 
dramatic. The fine linen fabric, dyed $finecolor, has a luminescence
to it, the fabric having a distinctive drape that flatters the form
while remaining comfortable even in such a formal cut.

        INTERVIEW GUIDELINES FOR THE RECRUITMENT CENTER

1: Are they of sound mind and body? Do they have a good reason for
wanting to join, or are they hell-bent on bloodlust? Are they emotionally
stable and able to function in society? Can they handle the physical
rigors of service?

2: Do they have a proper attitude towards their own recruitment, or can
they be molded to one? Are they willing to work, and do they respect
authority? If not, how easy would it be for them to learn?

3: Why are they joining? What can they do for us?

4: What previous employements have they had? How did they do there?
Do they have references?

5: What is their level of understanding of military protocol, and what
other useful skills do they have?

6: Find out if there's anything else they'd like to tell us about
themselves, and more importantly, why they wanted to share it.

7: Question anything else you feel necessary. Make a judgment call.

8: If they are solid candidates, explain to them our expectations of them
and the rules of the Recruitment Center. Once satisfied that they not
only understand but agree, have them swear the following:

"I, <Full Name>, do hereby give oath of service to Gondor until the end
of my life or the release of my oath. I swear to follow the orders given
to me by my rightful superiors, even unto my own death, and to uphold the
ideals and standards expected of all men of Gondor."

Recruiter's Reply: "I, <Full Name>, <Rank> of <Organization> do hear and
accept your pledge in the name of Gondor, and greet you as Trainee
<Trainee's Name>."

A $finecolor silk dress with silver embroidery lays here.~
   This graceful deep pink dress is made of cool, smooth silk. 
Draping elegantly from the shoulders, it skims the body and falls 
to the floor in a long, flowing skirt. The deep pink silk is cut 
nearly to the waist in front, showing off the pale silver silk 
chemise underneath. Long, flared sleeves of deep pink flow most 
of the way to the floor, revealing arms clad in pale-silver, the 
fitted sleeves embroidered with tiny little stars and moons at 
the cuff. The neckline of the dress dress has been embroidered 
with the same pale silver stars and moons, and the bottom foot or 
so of the skirt's circumference is similarly embellished, giving 
the fabric additional weight and drape.

antiqued groove has been circumscribed just inside the edge of 
the ring-face, edging it neatly. Care has been taken in the 
finish of the ring, with the metals polished and nearly 
seamlessly joined together.

a pinewood painting easel~
A pinewood painting easel stands on three legs here.~
   This easel is made of pine wood, and three legs stick out from 
a small ledge-like block where an artist would rest his canvas. 
Two legs protrude from the side, whilst the back one balances it 
from falling backwards or leaning forward. Any canvas upon this 
would be slanting backwards slightly. This easel can hold a 
range of small to large canvas.

a long oak-shafted, steel-headed lucern hammer lies here reflecting the light.~
This polearm is of fine quality, made with a simplicity that denotes strength.  Its long oak shaft is wrapped in leather for an easier grip and ends in steel head that bares a wide hammer's head, spike at its top, and a hook at the back.  The weapon is weighty, but well balanced, allowing a vicious chop with little effort once the weapon is hefted.

A glass fishbowl sits here on its base, #5a small goldfish#0 swimming within.~
   This fishbowl is about the size of an average man's head and 
has been fashioned from clear glass. It has been flattened upon 
the bottom so that it can rest in place and the lip of the bowl 
curves in slightly so that there is less chance of spilling 
anything within when carrying or moving it from place to place. 
The bowl has been filled with fresh, clean water and within swims 
an animated, small goldfish.

   Osgiliath, once the jewel over the Anduin, home to the Kings 
of Gondor and the far-seeing Palantiri, is now but a ruined 
memory. In 2474, after years of attacks in Ithilien, the Witch 
King led an army of uruks, orcs, trolls and the feared Nazgul to 
the very gates of Osgiliath. The Gondorian Vanguard, once a 
proud army holding Ithilien firm, fought in East Osgiliath with 
valor and courage. Yet it was in vain. As the days went by the 
Nazgul overwhelmed all resistance and the White Lady of Ithilien 
herself fell upon the Dome of Stars to shine no more for Gondor 
or the Men of the West. - No man could face the Witch King, 
though many tried. The combined might of the Enemy bore down 
upon the walls of East Osgiliath and shattered the Vanguard, who 
retreated to the streets, then to the Great Dome spanning the 
Anduin. In the face of trolls and uruk-hai, the Vanguard faced 
terror itself and were diminished. In these days the Echtel, the 
heavy cavalry of Gondor were all but obliterated as they counter 
attacked and then stood to allow the others to build defences. 
Constable Erethalis led them while Tristam rallied his few 
remaining soldiers to barricade the western gates of the Great 
Dome. - Yet they were betrayed, for orkin poured under the city 
and issued from holes and tunnels long-prepared, surrounding a 
battered and ever more hopeless Vanguard. With the western gate 
into Anorien locked and barred by Lord Boromir's elite Dol Amroth 
knights, no salvation reached them, no light shone through the 
darkness of those last days. Tragically, those civilians who 
believed Osgiliath could never fall were heard for many days as 
they were discovered and slaughtered by the Enemy. Meanwhile in 
Anorien, orkin travelled across in rafts in small numbers, with 
the Wardenry and villeins of that fiefdom fighting side by side 
to throw them back. - In single battle against the Witch King 
many of the best of the Vanguard went to their

   Many of the organisations with which you might choose to work

licenses for you to be permitted to practise your craft in the 
realm of Lord Astirian. It is as well to decide exactly what 
your character is going to choose to do, and with which 
organisation (if any) before rushing to spend your valuable 
starting coin on licenses you may find later you did not need to 
purchase. 
   If you decide you do want to purchase one of these licenses, 
you need to become a villein of Lord Astirian. This means you 
must swear your oath of allegiance. You can only be sworn to one 
Lord at a time. You should find a Warden to take your Oath - 
they are found in Pelennor and Anorien. You can leave messages 
for them in the Wardog Tavern or at their bastions.

ooc sign fellowships INFO_FELLOW_CLANHALL OTHER~
an ooc sign here explaining about Fellowships~
An ooc sign explaining about Fellowships is here.~
   Fellowships are the perfect home for all budding crafters. 
Whatever your skill choice, there is a fellowship for you. The 
advantages of becoming fellowshipped are numerous: 

1. You are in a clan with other PCs and it will be easier to 
have PC interaction. 2. You have duties assigned so will never 
be bored. 3. Many Fellowships have PC Masters and Journeymen to 
teach you and help you improve along the way. 4. 
Fellowship-restricted crafts are open to you only and eventually 
you can design and produce your own objects and crafts in your 
very own shop. 5. Fellowships are protected by the City Council 
and Fellowship Council. Fellowship members look after each other 
and are considered high status in Gondor. 

To join the fellowships, ask other people who is a Master or 
Journeyman in the fellowship you are interested in, and then 
Hobbitmail that PC and ask to set up a time to speak with them, 
explaining what you wish to speak about and what time zones you 
are in. 

If you cannot find a PC crafter, send a message to the Staff 
member in charge of Fellowships, Ashtia, with the title 
"Fellowship Help Requested" and explain that you want to join a 
Fellowship, but do not know who to talk to. She can help you 
out, or her deputy, Zorba. 

Joining a fellowship requires an apprentice fee of between 200 
and 400 coppers, depending on the fellowship you wish to join. 
This is what you have to pay the fellowship in order to properly 
initiate you as an apprentice. There is also a fee as you raise 
to Journeyman and eventually Master. However, since you will be 
earning money and even perhaps running your own establishment, it 
is not a fee that you will find prohibitory compared to the 
benefits.

   Welcome to the Clan Hall Foyer. 

This place is meant to be a safe place for new players to our 
world to relax and find their feet. While we ask you to be as 
in-character as possible, you are not expected to have all the 
answers here. People walking round here are actual players, so 
please treat them as your character would. 

Some reminders on useful commands: "notify <name>" to notify 
someone and see if they are online right now, e.g. "notify bob". 
"petition all <message>" if you need a staff member to help you. 
You can ask Guides for help too and use the "ooc" command here 
(sparingly but do not worry too much about it), e.g. "ooc What 
is the command for talking?". 

If you go east at this point you will enter the Sun Plaza where 
you can type "enter hall" to come back in here at any time. In 
the Sun Plaza, Minas Tirith's Great Gates are to your east. The 
taverns and shops and stalls are all around you. West of you is 
a tunnel leading up to the other circles. North is housing and 
Fellowship Halls. South is the Great Market and the First Circle 
and ways up to the Second Circle of the city. 

Explore the Halls first if you are new though and feel free to 
arrange meetings here. When someone says "Hobbitmail or HM me" 
they mean send then a hobbitmail from our internal message 
system. The easiest way is to login at middle-earth.us and click 
on the Hobbitmail link on the left side of the page, then send 
one. Or you can quit out of here and send one from your login 
page. 

We really want you to enjoy yourself so please do ask if you need 
assistance and please do post and say hello on the New Players 
forum. 

Thanks and Welcome to SOI.

A squat, black metal stove stands here.~
   This small iron stove does not stand very high. It has a door 
on the front of it, allowing access to the interior where a fire 
can be lit. A couple of short iron legs hold it not more than a 
couple of inches from the floor. Two vents on the sides of the 
stove allow the heat of the fire to be controlled by limiting the 
air flow. Overall, this stove is too small to cook more than one 
thing at a time.

a masterfully constructed, emblazoned steel breastplate~
A masterfully constructed breastplate, emblazoned with a Keg lies here, awaiting its owner.~
   This steel breastplate has been expertly crafted, and polished 
to a high sheen. The steel is thick, beveled for extra 
reinforcement and protection, turning its edges into softer lines 
so as to turn the wanton weapon aside. Leather straps and steel 
buckles attach each half to the other, creating a formidable 
barrier around the wearer. Thick concave pauldrons dangle from 
the shoulder plates, to protect the armpit. Each pauldron is 
embellished with gold filigree, depicting a great mountain whose 
peak is obscured by hanging clouds. A large Keg, split by a 
greataxe made of twisted gold wire adorns its front set deep into 
the steel so as to avoid exposure. This masterfully made piece 
of armor provides excellent protection for the torso, shoulders, 
and back.

   RULES FOR RECRUITS: 

You will make your way northwards and speak with the soldier 
within the barracks whereupon detailed rules and the code of 
conduct shall be read out to you. Ask him as often as you need 
to in order to learn these. 

[OOC: Use "open door north" to open the northern door. Use 
"north" to then enter through the open doorway. Once within the 
barracks, "hear rules" will prompt the soldier to start reading 
out the Code of Conduct, the Rules and other Required Knowledge.] 

Talk to the lad here and leave a message saying who you are and 
if you need to take your Oath. [OOC: "look lad" to see the board 
posts. "write lad (MY NAME) ARRIVAL" etc to leave word. 

Recruits may not leave the Manse and especially not Osgiliath 
without escort and officer permission. If granted leave, they 
must behave well and ensure they do not bring a bad name to the 
Battalion of Lord Eradan. They must not stay out more than a day 
and must return by dawn to the Manse. They must leave word when 
leaving and leave word when they return. 

Salute all trainers or military officers on sight, and refer to 
them by rank or by "Sir". 

Finally - train hard and you will soon be heading East.

a massive, half-broken couch with $drabcolor fungus growing on it~
A massive, half-broken couch with $drabcolor fungus growing on it is here, its middle sagging.~
   This couch, perhaps once of great value and use, has 
debilitated into a rather mangy piece of furniture indeed. The 
cushioning from the arms and several of the cushions themselves 
are protruding in large, white pouf. The couch itself is of 
unusually large size, though it seems that it, too, has seen 
better days: the middle of it sags, as if the frame of the couch 
has been broken. Whenever it is sat upon, the creek of rotten, 
protesting wood would be present; despite these things, the couch 
is still strangely comfortable. Creeping slowly along the back 
of the couch, however, $drabcolor fungus is growing, expanding at 
a tedious pace in an attempt to claim the couch.

A narrow wooden bed with a splinter-ridden headboard sits here.~
   While this item fits the term 'bed' loosely, it'd be a lean 
couple indeed that could manage to fit two people onto its skinny 
frame. It looks to have seen quite a few attempt this, however, 
from the overall battered and roughly-used nature that this bed 
gives off, from the splinters in the headboard to the strangely 
regular notches placed on the top left bedpost.

a blood-stained, heavily marred wooden table of three and a half legs~
A heavily marred wooden table with three legs of wood and one of iron stands here shakily.~
   This wooden table, once a craftman's pride and joy, has 
obviously seen better days. It is scratched and marred, several 
deep grooves dragging over the surface in what seem to be old 
knife-wounds. The strangest aspect of this table, however, is 
that, at one time or another, one of its four wooden legs has 
been knocked away. Rather than adding a new one or junking the 
table altogether, however, a broken sword blade has been 
cannibalized into the position, its point dull and blunt.

#5A group of shabbily-dressed and ill-smelling beggars are here, sitting atop the couches and gathered around the trash-can fires.#0~
   The beggars inside this area seem to have little motivation to 
move out of their immediate area, be it clustered around one of 
the trash-can fires or slouched atop one of the various pieces of 
ragtag furniture littered about the area. Most of those present 
seem to know the others by sight and by name, greeting most of 
their brethren with the ease of long knowledge. The conversation 
between the various beggars seems to be relatively loose and 
comfortable, their numbering roughly some thirty.

a dusty, well-made canopy bed with pale blue linen sheets~
A well-made canopy bed with pale blue linen sheets has been set in the middle of the room, untouched but for a layer of dust and spiderwebs across it.~
   Untouched by all but the layer of dust and the homes of the 
spiders whose webs have been cast over the faded blue linen, this 
bed stands regally in the middle of the room, against the wall. 
The linens sweep the ground, the bed still perfectly made up with 
two pillows at the head of it. The canopy has been draped over 
the top, tied back to allow easy view onto the bed itself. The 
only imperfection is the nearly unnoticeable splotch of blood on 
the hem of the front part of the comforter where it brushes the 
floor.

A pair of black cotton leggings are set here.~
   These simply-made leggings have been sewn from black cotton, 
fitting loosely to the wearer's legs. They appear to have been 
designed for comfort and for everyday use, making them fit to 
work in. While they are simple of make, the seams were well-sewn 
and sturdy.

A green tunic with a white and grey patch has been left here.~
   Made of green cotton, this plain tunic has a keyhole neckline, 
wrist-length sleeves, and a flaring, thigh-length lower hem. Of 
simple construction, it is a very basic garment. However, a 
patch of a white city on a grey background marks the tunic, 
identifying the wearer as a member of the Minas Tirith 
Cityworkers.

The rotted head of a well muscled, sea green-eyed man has been left here.~
   This head is well rotted and quite gruesome to behold. The 
flesh has a terrible smell and is a pale blue in color. Most of 
it seems to have been picked at by some small creature. The 
eyes, what is left of them, slightly rolled back. The jaw is 
open, though rigor mortis seems to have departed long ago. The 
head has been severed with a sharp object, and the backbone 
appears to have been wrenched from the rest of the vertebrae, 
perhaps concluding that it was not done with a large weapon.

a waterfall fountain cascading from a sculpture~
A waterfall fountain cascading from a towering sculpture graces the center of the plaza.~
   One would be forgiven for thinking, at first glance, that this 
towering pale marble sculpture is a natural phenomenon hidden 
away in the City, so faithfully did its creator follow the wild 
and chaotic beauty of Nature's own patterns. A wild cascade of 
water bounces and sprays across a descending series of artfully 
sculpted rocks designed to draw the wild rushing water into a 
pool at its base. The pool extends about a foot out all around 
in a circular fashion. Through the water in the pool can often 
be glimpsed the glint of metal coins. Small lichens and ferns 
grow here and there in shadowed crevices, further adding to the 
living quality of the sculpture, and at its head a high-antlered 
stag lifts his proud head to gaze, forever to the skies.

A tall obelisk of black marble stands in the center of the room, plaques indicating the names etched into the monument.~
   This tall obelisk has been fashioned from black marble, 
polished to a high shine. It is mounted on a wide plinth, 
comprising on each of its sides three wide shallow steps. Below 
its sharply angled point, etched in relief into the stone, and 
whitened, is a carefully carved representation of the Tree of 
Gondor. Two of the monuments' sides are already covered with 
plaques bearing name after name carefully etched in Numenian 
Tengwar. Beside the monolith, aligned with one of its corners is 
a deeply carved round alabaster bowl, an arm's-span in diameter, 
and supported by another stylised representation of the White 
Tree. The bowl's dish is filled with oil, surface alight with 
gold and blue flames.

figure of the man has weathered the tests of time. Small cracks 
here and there litter the waist high work, while vines have

in sinewy veins of green. Borne by bent shoulders and strong 
hands, a large stone dish is filled with water, the insides now 
greened with time and age.

Simple yet tasteful in design, the ring betrays its artistry as 
the band expands to form the base of a circular disk at the apex, 
the silver darkened with time, bearing upon its face the 
stylized depiction of a left facing dragon with spread wings.

A doublet of $finecolor linen over a white linen shirt lies here.~
   This doublet is crafted of linen cloth of an average weave, 
and has been dyed $finecolor. It is of a solid color, and bears 
no pattern. The doublet fits fairly tightly, and limits one's 
range of motion slightly. It is a compromise between casual and 
formal wear, being suitable for either, though it is not a 
garment one would wish to do any arduous labor in. The doublet 
buttons down the front with shiny bronze buttons. The sleeves 
have a drawstring in the cuff, allowing the wearer to size it to 
his wrists. The sleeves are slit along the outer edge, which 
reveals the undershirt of white linen. This doublet is well 
made, with tight, neat stitches.

A delicate shell-shaped silver band set with a pearl has been laid aside here.~
   Distinctly feminine, this ring has been carefully shaped and 
poured. The top is shaped like a shell, and it gently cradles 
the pearl that is set within the exact center, held in place by 
three thin silver prongs. The silver cups to create a shell, 
detailing even the ridgelines along the interior of the clam 
shape, only extending just a little over the natural curve of the

strong silver, and the surface has been carefully polished to 
remove all mars.

   The top of this hairstick when turned one way might look like 
a small ocean wave, but with a closer glance, one would notice 
the delicate shaping of a clam shell. Nestled within the shell 
is a large pearl, luminescent and beautiful when striking the 
light. The shell seems to be cradled on a texture remnant of 
sand before slowly tapering down to the slender stick, and then 
point, of the hairstick. The silver has been polished to a 
gleam, and the hairstick is long enough to tackle even the 
thickest hair.

   This bench has been cobbled together by seemingly sticking 
whatever materials were laying about together in the rough 
imitation shape of a functional bench. It has four legs that 
protrude from the bottom of it, three of scarred, battered iron, 
one of a cracked and splintered wood. As for the main seating 
part of the bench itself, it looks long enough to hold some three 
persons of average-sized, with the flat seat being composed of 
iron and wood that have been lain together. For all its 
roughness, it seems that many butts have worn the top of it 
rather smooth and almost comfortable.

An elaborate, rune-inscribed, ornately-tooled saddle lay here.~
   This hand-tooled saddle is the work of an expert craftsman. 
Oak and split rawhide dyed a soft brown make the foundation for 
this ornate saddle, measured to fit. The seat has been lined 
with black wool-skin, retaining its practicality but providing 
added comfort to the rider. Gilded silver has been used 
generously to further enhance the decoration, prancing horses and 
an elaborate sun forming the center-piece of the saddle, which 
culminates with tooled fenders gracefully ending with 
silver-studded stirrups. Along the edge of the saddle, a long 
stretch of silver has been engraved in the sigils of 
Northern-Tengwar, the inscription reading, "We are the sons and 
daughters of the sword. The open fields are our mother's breast 
and our steeds instruct us of the honour of our fathers. The 
thunder of their hooves and the trembling of the earth sound our 
passing. Our lungs burn with the language of war and our brow 
carries the flash of steel. We are the Eotheod. We are the 
free."

A broad shield emblazoned with a white horse has been left here.~
   Boards of hard, heavy oak are held togeather by iron bandings 
and nails, forming this broad shield. The upper part is square 
in shape but two thirds down, it narrows into a rounded point. A 
leather strap for the forearm sits before a handle of smoothened 
oak, forcing a wearer to carry it on the left arm or upside down. 
The front side is painted, and a faded azure base covers the 
shield. Upon it in clearer white is a winged prancing horse, 
which upon close inspection details a stallion, somehow wielding 
a sword in what should be the front hooves. Overall the shield 
seems sturdy and reliable, though perhaps somewhat heavy.

large block of text in runic Angerthas-Daeron script, written in 
bold black ink. Beneath it, roughly equal in length and in ink

sigils of a Northern mode. Anyone skilled in either script would 
realize the passage hails from some long-forgotten heroic tale, 
and describes a long journey through forest and over hill. The 
text is clear enough to act as a cipher for translations between 
the Angerthas-Daeron and Northern-Tengwar scripts.

cipher Beleriand-Daeron Numenian-Tengwar translation scripts sages OTHER~
a Beleriand-Daeron and Numenian-Tengwar translation cipher~
A Beleriand-Daeron and Numenian-Tengwar translation cipher lays here.~
   This long sheaf of parchment is adorned at the top with a 
large block of text in runic Beleriand-Daeron script, written in 
bold black ink. Beneath it, roughly equal in length and in ink 
of the same colour, is a translation of the same text in Tengwar 
sigils of a Numenian mode. Anyone skilled in either script would 
realize the passage hails from some long-forgotten heroic tale, 
and describes a long journey through forest and over hill. The 
text is clear enough to act as a cipher for translations between 
the Beleriand-Daeron and Numenian-Tengwar scripts.

A large fountain of a man and a boy is here.~
   Carved from a single block of granite, this fountain shows the 
foundationof what fellowship is all about. A kindly older man 
wearing a smock and holding a hammer instructs his young pupil in 
the art of crafting. Surrounding the master and apprentice is a 
large round pool of water, the floor lined with ceramic tiles. 
Each tile is a different crest that represents each of the 
recognized fellowships in beautifully enamled colors.

A small, black leather case has been left lying here exposing black, wiry tools.~
   This small, black leather case would be easy to conceal. It 
contains a series of small loops on the inside, from which 6 wiry 
tools hang. One is a solid looking metallic handle with a sickle 
like hook on the end, another is fairly straight only bent at the 
very end. They are of slightly different lengths and sizes, one 
of which is as small as a needle but comes to three or four 
inches in length. All in all it is an odd and varied set of 
tools.

A pinewood, iron-hinge box sits here.~
   At first glance, it looks like nothing other than a hinged, 
rectangular pine-wooden box about the size of a small pillow. 
However, if one was to push the box open on its iron hinges, they 
would see it begins a larger square box with an oval indentation 
carved smoothly in the wood, as if it were a playing board for 
something. Along the oval indentation on the upper-right and 
lower-left side of the oval are five much smaller holes that look 
like they would contain something no bigger than a die.

A copper cloakpin of a horse with a red eye is here.~
   This copper cloakpin is an extremely detailed replica of a 
charging horse. The muscles in the flanks are flexed as if in a 
gallop and there is a small bit of froth issuing from the mouth. 
The mane is lifted slightly as if being tossed about by the wind, 
as is the tail. In place of the eye is a ruby red bead of glass 
that is set firmly and with care.

A copper cloakpin of an eagle with a red eye is here.~
   The details of this copper eagle are painfully accurate to the 
last feather. The whole of this piece is little more than two 
and one half inches wide, yet the attention to detail taken with 
it's creation more than makes up for its size. Each feather is 
carved individually to layer upon the next until they reach the 
smooth legs that end in sharp taloned claws. The setting of the 
eye is a small red glass bead that stares outward.

A copper cloakpin of a sword with a red pommel and shield is here.~
   This copper pin is shaped like a tower shield with a 
broadsword crossed diagonally over the face. The pommel of the 
sword bears a red glass bead and the length of the blade carries 
a very slight edge. The hilt is carved to resemble a leather 
wrapping that extends from the pommel to the cross-guard. The 
work put into this small piece was meticulous and every line and 
curve shows the dedication of its creator.

An oaken-shafted cane with a silver sun-and-moon emblem lays here.~
   This oaken cane is of obviously high quality, its shaft 
stained a dark, fine tone that rises the length of it. The end 
of the cane has been capped with a silver end, to produce a loud, 
authoritative sound should it be rapped hard against the floor. 
The handle of the cane is wrought of pure silver and, along the 
grip, an elaborate, finely-engraved emblem has been placed. The 
emblem seems to be that of a shining sun, rays of light emnanting 
from it, with a waning moon residing inside the circle of the 
sun's orb, a darkened, blackened sliver that casts an unfinished, 
incomplete look to the sun.

   This cane-sword, its secret bared, is made of high-quality, 
tempered steel, its blade perhaps as long as a man's arm and 
appears to be of expert craftsmanship. The blade itself is of a 
razor's edge, and the cane-grip is made of pure silver, an emblem 
portrayed upon its surface--that of a waning moon, encased within 
a shining sun. The emblem seems to be that of a shining sun, 
rays of light emnanting from it, a waning moon residing inside 
the circle of the sun's orb, a darkened, blackened sliver that 
casts an unfinished, incomplete look to the moon.

A finely-braided, silver necklace lies here.~
   This necklace appears to be formed by two, carefully-woven 
braids of silver that were later joined to form one necklace. 
The joint near the bottom of the necklace is a solid bar of 
silver formed out of the wires coming into it, the soldering 
causing them to gradually lose their distinctness and become a 
single solid joint. The result is a smooth-looking work that 
seems to flow down the wearer's neck from either side and draw 
the user's eyes to the joint.

evident skill and attention to detail. The blade is solid, 
polished to high-sheen and fashioned with expertise, revealing no

has sharpened expertly to a near razor-fine edge. An elegant 
cross-guard made of artfully dulled bronze is set above the fine 
maplewood hilt, protecting the wielders hand and wrist from 
damage. Thin black leather thongs have been wrapped around the 
hilt, providing a secure, solid grip. Around the base, some 
sindarin words have been engraved in numenian sigils, worked with 
skill on the steel, writing a word that wraps around the width of 
the blade.

painting xxLEODEGRANCE stark vivid painting headless statue PARCHMENT~
a stark, vivid painting of a headless statue~
A stark, vivid painting of a headless statue hangs here.~
   This painting, done in layers on canvas in thick oil paints, 
was obviously crafted by someone with great talent and practice. 
The subject of this painting is a statue, decrepit and old, which 
has withstood the ravages of time - though not entirely intact. 
It bears no head, as well as a number of smaller vandalisms, from 
chips to cracks to scrawled markings. Each of these little 
intricacies are detailed vividly, though the surroundings beyond 
and around the statue are hazy, with muted colours and the 
dulled, blurred faces and forms of passersby. In truth, the only 
object in focus in the painting is the literal focus: the statue 
itself. 



   In the bottom-right corner of the canvas is a form of 
signature: a silvery-grey lute painted on a scarlet-red flag.

a long, tattered tunic of $drabcolor velvet~
A long, tattered tunic of $drabcolor velvet lies here in a heap.~
   Made of worn velvet dyed a $drabcolor, this long, full-sleeved 
tunic extends to the knees of the wearer. The garment has a 
downy, crumpled texture, the fabric that comprises it clearly 
tattered and worn with age. Ropy lace is twined up the chest of 
the tunic, allowing it to be parted for ease of removal. Wide 
bands of light, faded embroidery, sewn in thread of a darker 
tone, surround the neckline and bottom hem of the garment.

   This signet ring is made from a gradually widening silver band 
supporting a flat square surface. Along the edge of the surface

accompanied by a small depiction of a cleaver.

A small, silver spoon hanging from a silver necklace lies here.~
   This tightly fitted silver necklace supports a finely cast, 
three inch silver spoon. Belying being cast, this spoon's 
surface is smooth and mirrored, glinting lightly in the nearby 
light. The bowl of the spoon has been set with a sunstone 
cabochon held in place by a silver setting in a way to let light 
flow freely through the gem. The back of the spoon has been 
deeply engraved with the words "My heart in a spoon - Philip 
Aurtin"

a black-steel altar with gold filigree~
A black-steel altar with gold filigree stands here, the light glinting from the golden runes.~
   This altar stands at about navel heigh on the average man, 
marking it as somewhat taller than other such altarpieces seen 
around the world. Length-wise, the altar itself is massive, some 
eight feet long, and easily between three and four across. 
Looking to have been smelted in entirely one piece, this massive 
altar of black-steel has been polished and shined to a hue so 
that even the blackness of its main material shines brightly. 
Placed in a seemingly never-ending pattern across the entirety of 
the matte-black surface is a number of strange, sharp-looking 
golden glyphs. Staring at any of them for too long brings out a 
fierce sense of unease and discomfort.

landscape UNIQUE_POFANBORN minas tirith dawn painting OTHER~
a landscape depicting Minas Tirith before dawn~
A landscape depicting Minas Tirith before dawn hangs from the wall here.~
   The grand spire of Minas Tirith is but a humble thing in this 
picture, blurry and distant, framed with a great mountain behind 
it. It depicts the world in early morning, the sun's light 
rendered dim beneath a veil of mist and fog that clings to the 
ground. The yellow grasses of the Pelennor fields stretch from 
the city to the viewpoint, where they are rendered in stark 
detail, their color muted and pale in the half-light. As one 
looks back to horizon, the work grows less distinct: The road to 
the great Gates of the city curves halfway through the picture, 
and here and there upon it are dotted travelers, here a soldier, 
there a hay-cart. Each of the small figures are formed of only 
the barest wisps of paint, the overall style more suggestive than 
realistic. The city itself would be nigh-unrecognizable, save 
for its distinctive, circular tiers. 
   The painting is about two feet in both width and height -- In 
the lower right corner is a stylized 'A.' Embossed on the reverse 
side, should one find reason to look, is a seal depicting a quill 
crossed with a paintbrush struck through by the initials TMT.)

A transparent quartz stone filled with black, pulsing light lays here.~
   This large stone, roughly as long as as a grown man's hand, 
shows all of the qualities of being an average piece of faceted 
quartz--the mirror, prism-esque sides, the smooth surfaces, the 
pyramid tips and bottom--save for the black, dark light that 
pulses from within it. While the light tapers off towards the 
edges of the crystal, in the center of the once-white crystal 
lies a blackened, pulsing heart. Staring at the gem, to those 
unaccustomed to such a sight, would cause a sense of unease, of a 
primal, instinctive warning, to rise.

   The area here is unnaturally cold, the temperature some 
fifteen degrees what it should be. More than that, there's 
something uncomfortable about standing in this chill for too 
long, it promoting a sense of unease. The cold, as well, seems 
to be an aberration from the norm, it seeming to hold a sense of 
malevolency, of anger, as it gnaws and bites at any exposed 
flesh.

crossguard protects the hand and the hilt is wrapped in wire and 
blue leather. It has a rounded pommel for perfect balance.

A clear flask filled with a slow-moving, black substance lays here.~
   This clear flask seems to be of simple enough make, the nozzle 
of it clear and unadorned, as is most of the glass item. It 
seems to be what the flask houses that particularly catches the 
eye--a sluggishly moving, black substance that moves only 
reluctantly about the flask when it's tilted. At odd times, 
however, when the light catches the flask just right, a sort of 
glint or sparkle can be seen within the dark liquid.

a blued-steel longsword with a wrapping crossguard~
A blued-steel longsword with a wrapping crossguard has been forgotten here.~
   This finely wrought longsword has been forged from the finest 
steel, which has been blued through some elaborate metallurgic 
process, yielding a darkened, beautiful surface. Almost three 
feet long and traversed by a long fuller, this longsword bears an 
exotic, wrapping crossguard, which is born on the hilt and 
embraces each side of the weapon, shaped like a stallions neck 
and head and fashioned from what seems to be an alloy of gold. 
The same equine figure, with a more elaborate detail, has been 
fashioned as a pommel, the horses eyes made of dark onyx, 
glinting dully from the golden setting and offering protection 
and counterweight to the blades heft. Although sharpened to a 
razored finish on both sides, the position of the pommel and the 
length of the blade makes it easier to slash with one side, 
making this a perfect blade for a rider yet solid and deadly 
enough for a swordman. The hilt is made of a darkly varnished 
wood, wrapped in fine, dark leather. Two small sindarin runes 
have been set on the base of the blued-steel blade, the only 
identity from the maker.

   Boards of hard, heavy oak are held togeather by iron bandings

in shape but two thirds down, it narrows into a rounded point. A 
leather strap for the forearm sits before a handle of smoothened 
oak, forcing a wearer to carry it on the left arm or upside down. 
The design of it boasts two rearing horses in gold facing each 
other on a field of black, trimmed in gold. Overall the shield 
seems sturdy and reliable, though perhaps somewhat heavy.

mace EXPERT_QUALITY brutal fist-shaped smoky steel UNIQUE_PGERAINT METAL~
a brutal, fist-shaped mace of smoky steel~
A brutal mace with its head shaped like a fist has been neglected on the ground.~
   Forged from a smoky, matte steel, the head of this mace has 
been expertly shaped to resemble a gauntleted, closed fist and 
fitted to a heavy, long steel shaft. The head belays no mark or 
mar from hammer or any other tool, which implies that the metal 
was molten and then set into the extremely elaborate mold that 
yielded the exotic shape of the plate-covered, gauntleted fist. 
The sides of the fist are flat, permitting the force of the blow 
to hit with full strength on its target, while the fingers and 
knuckles are also made of the same solid metal, permitting the 
wielder to deliver harsh, shattering hits no matter where the 
mace hits. The shaft is also made from the same, exotic smoky 
steel, and a single word 'Aequitas' has been engraved on its 
length. A finely worked yet amazingly tough leather has been 
wrapped on the base of the shaft for the wielders comfort, then 
looped from the end for the wrist to keep the weapon secure at 
all times, being the only show of softness of this harsh, 
masterfully made weapon. Two small sindarin runes have been set 
on the base of the head, the only identity from the maker.

This instrument is composed of soft, carved wood parts secured with adhesive sap, and a set of four gut strings drawn tight from a swirled, scroll-shaped head to the sturdy tail piece. In its better days, the fiddle bore a bright, even coat of $finecolor paint, but the finish has marred considerably with time. The curves of its body are swooping and at times asymmetrical, giving it a vaguely exotic look. Swirling holes are cut out of the face, allowing the sound that resonates inside the hollow body to escape.

battered violin case OTHER~
a battered violin case~
A battered violin case has been discarded here.~
   This rectangular parcel has seen a great deal of wear, the 
dark leather scratched and split superficially along the seams. 
Along one edge is a pair of tarnished brass hinges which allow 
the lid to be flipped backward. Doing so reveals a bed of maroon 
velveteen, its texture rubbed almost completely away with use. 
An unadorned leather strap allows the case to be worn at the 
shoulder or across the back.

a portion of amber colored tree rosin~
a portion of amber colored tree rosin has been discarded here~
   Slightly smaller than a handful, this portion of orange tree 
rosin is tacky to the touch. The exterior is soft and it 
responds to heat by softening further, but the core is rigid and 
subject to cracking. It holds impressions and mars well and 
increases friction on any surface it is applied to.

well worn violin bow marred cherry finish instrument WOOD~
a well worn violin bow~
A well worn violin bow with a marred cherry finish is here.~
   This rod of sturdy wood bows in a gentle, convex curve. Fine 
horsehair pulled tight between the pointed tip and the handle is 
meant to be drawn over the strings of a suitable instrument, and 
can be loosened or even removed by unwinding a rotating mechanism 
at the bottom. This particular bow has clearly seen its share of 
use, and the cherry finish on the wood has been scored and worn 
away in places.
