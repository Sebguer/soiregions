possibly what a team of laborers might use to work in a logging

   Half-full of warm, exotically fragrant bathwater, this tub is 
made of thick porcelain over a metal base of some kind, and is 
masterfully crafted, with four sturdy bronze claw-footed bases. 
Naturally there are no taps -- it must be filled by hand with 
water, though a drain at its bottom allows water to pour out into 
a waiting container for disposal. The porcelain is pure white 
and very clean, outlining the features of the large, roomy 
bathtub. It slopes toward the back so one may lay back at will.

a waiting container for disposal. The porcelain is pure white 
and very clean, outlining the features of the large, roomy 
bathtub. It slopes toward the back so one may lay back at will.

   Roughly ten inches long, this misshapen mass of metal and 
impacted slag has a hefty, solid weight, and bears a spongy, 
porous surface. Useless on its current form, some process must 
be performed to turn this mostly metallic mass into a useable 
product.

   Many lengths of wood have been stacked to create this 
utilitarian pyre. It sits just a few feet off the ground, the 
pieces arranged in a way that is conducive to its task. The top 
is level, just long and wide enough for a body to be placed upon 
it, widening out to a study base of bigger, rounder logs to 
ensure its stability.

cloak voluminous cloak made of jet-black fox fur CUSTOM pTirnenestel qShadow LEATHER~
a voluminous cloak made of jet-black fox fur~
A massive cloak made of lustrous jet-black fox fur and bound with a heavy silver chain lays here.~
   Made for a large person, this cloak has been made with an 
extremely careful hand. The blackest of fox furs have been sewn 
together to form the outer face of this cloak, with the hems 
reaching easily down near a man's feet. The hood has been 
enlarged and deepened, giving it a low-hanging appearance when 
worn fully. The hood's base has a silver clasp on each side, 
with a large hand-span length of heavy silver chain binding the 
two sides together when attached. The stitches of the cloak have 
been hidden with great skill beneath the fur, all with black 
thread. The inner lining, including the hood has been sewn 
together with fine midnight black linen. Bound artfully with 
more black thread, it does not sag or hang from the rest of the 
cloak, rather it moves where the rest does. While the cloak is 
of an extremely skilled hand, the intricate embroidery has been 
done much more carefully. With many carefully detailed rays, a 
large star has been stitched with silver floss across the main 
body of the cloak, nearly filling the portion of the garment 
below the hood. Where it the cloak would rest upon the right 
shoulder, the lining of the cloak has been inlaid with the 
complex form of a hawk in flight. Its wings are spread in a 
predatory manner in stark contrast to the form on the wearer's 
left shoulder. The gentle form of a dove has been set into the 
material, with a small branch stitched in between its diminutive 
beak. Within the deep hood, easily covering the broad cowl is 
the intricate form of the White Tree of Gondor. Each root, 
branch, and leaf has been detailed in carefully, the branches 
raised up in all of their glory. There it stays, surrounded by a 
arc of many pointed stars. The final embroidered bit, which 
would be visible only to the wearer when the hood was raised 
rests at eye level. Along the hood's inner hem, the phrase "Pada 
vi i calad, Ion uin Forod" has been stitched. It is done in the 
script of Arnorian Tengwar, with words of the Sindarin tongue.

A dark brown leather overcoat bearing the embroidery of a White Tree and a cart.~
   Made of sturdy leather, this dark brown garment is undyed, but 
no less functional. Extending down to mid-shin of most wearers, 
it is a rather comfortable fit to most individuals. Proof 
against the elements it is quite warm in the winter when closed, 
and cool in the summer when left open. About its entirety are 
three straps, the top and bottom thinner than the middle. Each 
ends on a bronze buckle. The collar is well made and lays flat 
against the rest of the garment. Across the right shoulder is an 
embroidered trade cart.

a picked quince tree~
A picked quince tree grows here.~
   A few small scarlet flowers still bloom in clusters along the 
thorny and tangled stems of this bushy, deciduous shrub. As tall 
as it is wide, no fruits can be seen on the shrub at the moment. 
Bright-green, elliptical leaves contrast with the gray bark on 
its younger stems and the brown, peeling bark on the older woody 
stems. Its sharp thorns pose a painful threat to anyone trying 
to prune this fruit laden quince shrub.

Right now they are resting out of the view of thier boss.

   A long, slender sausage has been coiled into a spiral, a 
greenish mold creeping along its scabrous sides. Here and there, 
chunks of some many-legged insects can be seen through the 
semi-transparent casing, composing the filling of this orcish 
delicacy along with some meat of uncertain origin. Well-cured 
and fully fermented, this dry sausage would probably last for a 
long, long time.

A silver birch tree grows here.~
   This gracile, hardy, tough tree is easy to spot and recognize. 
White, almost silver, bark identifies it immediately. Thin, 
whip- like twigs hang down to form a veil adding to its graceful 
and delicate appearance. Its leaves are small and triangular, 
sometimes diamond-shaped, arranged on thin stalks, their edges 
toothed irregularly. In the spring, long hanging catkins of 
small flowers are worn by male birches, while in autumn, dark 
green catkins are worn by the female. It has been drained of its 
sap, a spigot still remaining in place in the wood.

the tree some time to recover.

A porcelain tub filled with steeping gin sits here.~
   The tub is made of thick porcelain over a metal base of some 
kind, and is masterfully crafted, with four sturdy bronze 
claw-footed bases. Naturally there are no taps -- it must be 
filled by hand with water, though a drain at its bottom allows 
water to pour out into a waiting container for disposal. The 
porcelain is pure white and very clean, outlining the features of 
the large, roomy bathtub. It is filled with steeping gin.

wearer, with long, full cheek-guards that extend and wrap over

creates a vertical slit about two fingers in breadth extending 
from beneath the chin to the bridge of the nose where it opens 
even further to allow ample room for unobscured vision. It has 
been treated with wax, the process hardening the leather and 
allowing it to be created without a single stitched seam. The 
interior is lined with soft cotton fabric, providing comfort and 
further protecting the wearer from blows.

allowing it to be created without a single stitched seam. The 
interior is lined with soft cotton fabric, providing comfort and 
further protecting the wearer from blows.

A slimy, sticky, reeking glob of ooze is spread out here.~
   This thick dark glob of ooze sticks to anything it touches, 
although it feels slippery at the same time. It has a sharp 
acidic smell that reeks like the most horrendous stench of 
rotting vegetation and meat that's been left in the sun. The 
whole thing coats uniformly, whether upon wood or vegetation or 
stone or skin.
