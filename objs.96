A bush with a sparse scattering of needle-like leaves and trusses of mauve flowers grows here.~
   This small bush has grown to a height of about three feet. 
Straight branches support narrow, dark green leaves which have 
been liberally picked, leaving some of the branches nearly nude. 
The sparse remains leave the plant looking bedraggled. It will 
need time to recover before more leaves can be picked. The 
leaves are similar to those of the pine tree in length and shape 
but emit a pungent aromatic smell. Trusses of small mauve 
flowers odorn the shrub, covering it almost dew-like.

the tree. It grows to only about a one foot high. Its flowers 
are green and stalked, and its leaves are lanceolate and toothed. 
Most of the leaves have been plucked from the small plant. 
Although it isn't so denuded that it won't survive, it's probably 
wise to pick no more. Exuded from this little beauty is an 
extremely pungent and unpleasant odour.

Some chestnut lumber has been laid aside here.~
   These planks have been planed to produce a smooth surface, 
revealing a narrow band of soft, pale-yellow sapwood and a 
durable dark yellow-brown heartwood. The planks are generally 
quite small or narrow as the wood is prone to small splits. Some 
of the larger planks in this pile are marred by these 'shakes'.

A sinuous ivy-like bush plucked of some of its silver-tipped leaves grows here.~
   This trailing ivy-like plant is formed of sinuous vines. 
Unlike an ivy, however, the leaves are tipped in silver. 
Although the whole plant has an elegant beauty to it, someone has 
plucked a good number of the leaves. The plant will probably 
survive, but it's unlikely it could stand another harvesting 
quite yet.
