The Central Room Of A Farmhouse~
   The overwhelming scent of pine betrays just how new this
central room of the farmhouse is. In contrast to the newly
finished walls on the west and east, the rooms to the north
and south appear to be much older. The newer walls to the 
west and east each have a single maple trimmed window set in
them. A pair of heavily reinforced oak doors lie on the west
and east with heavy metal bands securing the eastern door.
To the north and south smaller pine doors lead further into
the house. Wooden pegs are attached to the wall in a row near
the eastern door.

A Small Attic Room~
   Accessible by ladder and trapdoor this small attic room has 
been built into the gabled portion of the centre of the 
farmhouse. Strong pine wood timbers hold up the eaves of the 
roof which has been laid with a myriad of finely carved wooden 
shingles. The room for the most part is too low to allow a fully 
grown person to stand upright comfortably. Only the centre of 
the room is tall enough for one or two people to stand.

Eastern Rath Daelond~
   Passing a rather sinuous route through the slums of Minas 
Tirith's second circle this road begins to widen to accomodate a 
multitude of small shops and businesses. Street urchins and 
beggars wander the streets from shopfront to shopfront under the 
watchful eye of roving guards and uneasy merchants. In the 
distance to the northwest, dominating the skyline is the great 
Mount Mindolluin, a long arm reaching out cutting the city in 
half. The foul smell of rubbish and human waste wafts out onto 
the street from a dirt alleyway winding between a pair of squat, 
aged buildings at the western side of the road.

Eastern Rath Daelond~
   Decrepit and ill-kept housing looms over the wide street that 
twists and turns its way ever north and south. The houses 
compete for space along the road's margins; most have two or 
three stories, each overhanging into the street and blocking out 
the skyline and views of the mighty Mindolluin. Small groups of 
watchmen patrol up and down the streets, watching the commercial 
activities of the crowds.

   The cries of street vendors and their customers fills the air 
like a great orchestral composition. Goods change hands with 
lightning speeds, people seldom lingering, bustling up and down 
looking for the next bargain. The road is littered with the 
commercial rubbish of a busy trading area, street urchins picking 
through the litter looking for scraps of food and other discarded 
treasures.

   The road straightens at this point in order to thread itself 
through the Carak tunnel which breeches the outcrop of the 
Mindolluin which bisects the city into north and south portions. 
The street walkers and denizens become more dense, and squashed 
as the houses press in on them from the east and west. The cries 
of street vendors become louder and more aggressive as they 
attempt to convince the shoppers out of their last few coins 
before they disappear into the dark tunnel.

for flagstones and the road widened to allow traffic to pass more 
freely. There is much activity here, a number of newly opened 
shops look new and shiny in comparison to the rest of the dirty 
slum dwellings which surround them.

   The slums of Minas Tirith look less desperate and dishevelled 
along this stretch of wide, straight road. Modestly dressed 
merchants weave in and out of the newly opened shops keeping 
their distance from the rag tag urchins and grubbier residents of 
the surrounding rundown slum housing. The neat, recently laid 
flagstones show some wear and tear and the usual street refuse 
and rubbish clutters the gutters. 
   Steps on the eastern side of the street lead down into a dingy 
auction house.

wary of pickpockets, ever looking for a bargain, and always leery 
of the other folk that populate these streets. There is always

   The road undulates up and down as many of the cobblestones 
have been worn smooth or cracked by the heavy traffic that has a 
habit of speeding along this unusually long and straight section 
of Rath Daelond. Lampposts line the street but the haphazard 
nature of the multistorey buildings that overhang the road mean 
much of the light is blocked out, leaving the area overshadowed 
during day and dark during the night.

   The southeastern section of Rath Daelond runs as straight as 
the crow flies. Small grey cobbles cover the surface of the 
road, many worn almost flat by the iron rims of the heavily laden 
carts which wind their way along its length. The street is 
particularly narrow here and many alleys branch off from it, 
leading to a multitude of small shacks and slum dwellings.

with great speed along this narrow portion of Rath Daelond, its 
straight course with few turns and foul smelling alleys and 
street litter, means few linger here for long. A few small shops 
line this portion of the street selling cheap goods to the 
masses.
   The eastern door has been boarded up, and the building has

Shadows along Rath Daelond~
   Criss-crossed by small alleys and lined with numerous 
shopfront doors, the traffic that moves across Rath Daelond is 
often as heavy as that which moves swiftly along it. The street 
is very busy, and the shouts of the merchants and rattling of the 
wagons and wains is at times deafening. The noise continues 
through every hour of the day and through all weathers come rain, 
snow or sunshine. A thick wooden door stands out among the 
ramshackle buildings on the eastern side of the street.

Southeast Rath Daelond~
   Groundfloor shops and tall tenement apartments crowd the 
pavements of southeastern Rath Daelond. Scruffs, vagabonds, 
peasants, the occassional watchman and soldier pass up and down 
the road stepping into a shop to purchase goods or browsing the 
stalls of the street peddlars. The road is roughly cobbled and 
runs true and straight from north to south.

On Rath Daelond~
   The straight section of grotty old Rath Daelond reaches its 
terminus here as the road starts to turn towards the east. The 
road widens a little giving the faster travellers a chance to 
slow to take the turn in the road at a more leisurely pace.
An old building stands to the east, its windows and doors
boarded and sealed shut.

Passage between the City Walls~
   Two small portico gates close off the passage way, one 
directly to the east and the other to the west. The route cuts 
through the city's wall to facilitate quick passage between the 
two circles. A long set of stairs midway along the passage 
allows folk to descend to the second circle or ascend to the 
third circle. The passage is wide enough for two people to pass 
comfortable abreast but the passage is not high enough for 
mounted passage or wide enough for wains and wagons.

North Eastern Rath Daelond~
   The road turns close to the towering walls of the third 
circle, a large buttress protrudes across a portion of the wall 
restricting the traffic. Rath Daelond begins a long northern 
stretch here. The outskirts of the northeastern slum quarter 
come into view for the very first time. A shadowy darkness looms 
over the area as the buildings cluster together towering over the 
narrow side streets and alleys.

Approaching the Northeastern Slums~
   The road gently curves away from the imposing walls of the 
third circle and plunges into the depths of the northeastern 
quarter of the second circle. The slum buildings are an 
impressive sight, space is to a great premium, each building 
seems to squeeze every last inch out of the available space 
grasping out skywards greedily. What little space is available, 
is filled with old crates.

Rath Daelond passes away from the Slums~
   Rath Daelond swings away from the grotty slums to the 
northeast, almost as if the builders of this great route were 
repulsed by the seedy sights and sounds beyond. The third circle 
gates are still some distance away to the west. The road ahead 
to the west looks to be filled with houses, shacks and other 
indeterminate slum dwellings. A stern-fronted, quite large, 
house stands along the eastern road.

the south and west. There is little immediate noise present 
along the road, though the distant din of the first and second 
circles gently vibrates here. The sparse men and women who move 
by are moderately dressed, or in the garb of the Minas Tirith 
Guard. A number of stone buildings follow the street as it 
bends, far from the typical slums of the second circle.

Bottleneck along Rath Daelond~
   The cobbles in many places have been worn smooth by the wheels 
of wagons and coaches that travel Rath Daelond. Wide ruts in 
places direct the passage of these vehicles. In most places two 
sets of tracks divide the road into westward and eastward bound 
traffic. Barely visible to the east the road begins to turn away 
from the first circle wall. To the west the road follows the 
curvature of the wall.

all wagons and wains heading to the third and higher circles must 
pass along this route. This stretch of the road is bordered by 
the first circle wall for as far as the eye can see. The north 
side of the street is lined by a variety of unkempt and archaic

Southeastern Rath Daelond~
   A great throng of people, mounts, wains and wagons pushes up 
and down the street which reaches a natural bottleneck as the 
road makes a sharp turn up ahead to the east. Rath Daelond is 
extremely busy here as all wide loads heading to and from the 
third and higher circles must pass along here. The street 
peddlars of the slums take advantage of this great concentration 
of travellers and commuters to sell their wares.

Rath Daelond leaving the Summer Plaza~
   The Summer Plaza ends and Rath Daelond once again becomes 
narrow and restricted, following the gentle curving walls of the 
first circle. Residing to the north is the elegant wall of one 
of the great archaic fellowship halls of Minas Tirith. A series 
of stone urn and pot statues line a mantle of the facade 
indicating this hall belongs to the Fellowship of Potters.

Linden Tree Collonade~
   Carefully layed cobblestones of black and grey, arranged in a 
chequerboard fashion, are the signature of Rath Sinth. Beside 
each side of the road is a well-tended grass verge with tall 
linden trees planted at intervals providing shade and shelter to 
the users of this thoroughfare. Tall townhouses border Rath 
Sinth along this stretch, each provided with ample land for 
gardens and yards.

   The wide street of Western Rath Sinth curves slowly to head to 
the north and east here, passing through the richly endowed 
buildings of this section of Minas Tirith. The street is lined 
with trees which form an elegant colonnade providing shade and

the third circle.

between the buildings curves gently, parallel with the bordering 
buildings, which in turn run parallel to great walls of the third 
and fourth circles. Merchants, housewives, workers and eager

The Eastern Side of the Third Circle~
   The tall terraced buildings which border the wide avenue which 
bisects them have been populated by many of the affluent 
fellowshipped merchants of the City. Merchant signs compete to 
gain the attention of the folk that walk Rath Sinth. Many of the 
signs jut out wide into the street, some use bright and vibrant 
colours and others are adorned with decorative features designed 
to catch the wandering eye. The street is kept clear of litter, 
the trees are regularly trained and pruned to remove any large 
overhanging branches. A well-appointed house, which was once 
some sort of shop, stands to the west.

Eastern Rath Sinth~
   The busy streets are full of affluent merchants promenading up 
and down. The folk that use Rath Sinth often pause to duck into 
one of the many doorways of the businesses that occupy the 
groundfloor storeys of townhouses which line the street. 
Residents can be seen leaning out of the windows above the 
street, some tending plants in windowboxes or hanging baskets, 
some hanging their laundry to dry and others merely lounging on 
their balconies. An austere, granite structure looms to the 
west, while across the road, a recently renovated townhouse faces 
it.

   Placed at regular intervals, alternating with iron lamp-posts, 
are ornamental cherry and apple trees. The road is regularly 
swept and cleaned and the cobblestones, although in places are 
worn smooth and flat, show no sign of cracks or damage. 
Bordering the pavement and cobblestone stretch of Rath Sinth are 
tall townhouse buildings. To the west a recently renovated 
building stands with a large brass knocker.

Rath Sinth Turns Toward the Second Circle~
   The road bends slightly towards the great third circle wall 
and a small portico gate set within it. A narrow doorway and 
staircase cut into the base of the wall allowing access to the 
second circle. As the road turns against the passage of the 
third circle wall the houses that back against it have been built 
smaller to take full advantage of the limited space.

Rath Sinth Approaching the Denmoth Tunnel~
   In the distance to the south the faint outline of the Denmoth 
Tunnel can be made out cutting a great hole into the very bowels 
of Mount Mindolluin. Either side of the road the multi-storey 
townhouses of Rath Sinth tower impressively over the road, 
pavements and grass verges of this well-kept route. The streets 
are kept clear of rubbish and litter by the busy cityworkers 
which work this circle. The occasional shop or business 
occupies one of the groundfloor tenements of the townhouses. A 
large window and trader's sign mark its presence to would-be 
shoppers.

   This building is a single, simple room, constructed from white

situated here in order to provide protection to the shops of the 
southwestern portion of the second circle. Two large shutters, 
each bearing a secure bolt, provide a view onto the street of 
Rath Daelond to the south. A small lamp hangs from the ceiling 
providing illumination and a few simply furnishings allow the 
occupants some comfort.

Southeastern Rath Sinth~
   The imposing outcrop of Mount Mindolluin that bisects a large 
portion of Minas Tirith rises high to the north. In the distance 
cut into the side of this great rock the Denmoth tunnel pierces 
through its very heart to emerge the other side. The gray and 
black cobbles of Rath Sinth carry the masses of folk that walk 
the third circle upon their daily journeys. Rich nobles, 
merchants, servants, and the poor mingle here.

   Rath Sinth continues its merry way, following the path of the 
great walls of Minas Tirith. White stoned townhouses neatly line 
the side of the road, their facades are commonly covered with 
decorative stonework and adorned with floral windowboxes and 
hanging baskets. Hanging above a number of the ground floor 
doors are shop signs and notices. A small clothier's shop stands 
out amongst the many others. It has a large shopfront. To one 
side of the shop is a narrow staircase leading up to the second 
floor of the building.

Neatly Cobblestoned Rath Sinth~
   The gray and black cobblestones have been arranged more neatly 
than usual to form an elegant chequerboard pattern. A neat grass 
verge lines the road on each side of the street, separating the 
passage of the wagons and wains from those that walk the streets 
upon the pavements adjacent to the houses that mark the border of 
the road. The street bustles both day and night with folk going 
about their business. To the east lies a dilapidated shop, 
clearly once a Leatherworks. A sign showing the tools of the 
trade hangs off a single hinge, swinging above the door.

By a Closed Shop on Rath Sinth~
   The cobblestones here have been neatly arranged into a gray 
and black chequerboard fashion. The road is neatly lined with 
tall linden trees planted at regular intervals alternating with 
the black painted iron street lampposts. The folk that pass up 
and down this portion of the third circle, are for the most part, 
well-dressed and affluent-looking. Merchants go about their 
daily business and the nobility and their entourages pass up and 
down from the fourth and higher circles of the City. On the west 
side of the road, the closed building of a former shop sits 
behind a locked door.

   Standing to one side of busy Rath Celerdain is a modest 
looking trading stand. The sweet smell of cooking spices and 
pungent herbs wafts from the stands entrance. Piled around the 
base of the stand is a great stack of burlap sacks, containing a 
wide variety of grains and flour. Before the stand is a counter 
upon which a variety of different shaped measuring cups and jugs 
lay. The grain merchant uses these to measure out his wares for 
the eager shoppers which wander up and down the road.

Junction in Rath Celerdain leading to the Second Circle~
   The Merchant's Way continues its journey around the first 
circle of Minas Tirith. The junction here marks the beginning of 
the long winding ramp which leads up to the gates of the second 
circle. The ramp is wide enough for two carts to pass one 
another. The traffic is carefully marshalled by the guards that 
are stationed nearby, to the left the wagons travelling up to the 
second circle are directed and to the right those that are 
descending travel. The majority of the traffic bears 
northeastwards towards the main gates of the city, the wains and 
wagons for the most part are empty.

The Hobgoblin Brewery~
   This small shop is tucked away in the very corner of the 
second circle, where the second circle wall meets the start of 
the third circle wall. A long wooden counter made of roughly 
hewn pinewood lines the length of the backwall, separating vendor 
from customers. Along the side of the southern wall is a hastily 
erected pinewood rack designed to hold numerous small casks. The 
shop is located in a very quiet and isolated spot, few casual 
shoppers manage to find it. Most of the business of this 
backstreet brewer however goes straight to its sister tavern next 
door. A poorly hung birchwood door in the northern wall forms a 
convenient shortcut into the tavern. The birchwood door has a 
strong sturdy lock upon it and is bound with iron straps to 
reinforce it.

Ramp to the Second Circle~
   The ramp ascends towards the gate of the second circle leaving 
the Merchant's Way and the first circle behind it. It takes 
careful organisation by the guards to ensure the wains, wagons 
and noble's coaches are carefully directed up and down ramp 
without collision or harm to the folks who transverse the ramp on 
foot. The cobbles here have been worn smooth by the sheer volume 
of daily traffic.

Ramp Before the Second Circle Gate~
   The ramp continues to ascend towards the second circle gate. 
It is possible to look down upon the whole of the southern half 
of the first circle from this height, looking over the crowds of 
folk moving up and down Merchant's Way and the roofs of the 
dwellings that pack themselves tightly between the outer walls 
and the walls of the second circle. Just a little bit further to 
the north lies the great portcullis and gates that guard the next 
circle. Guards stand upon the ramp directing and controlling the 
throngs of people, animals and vehicles that transverse it.

The Boxes and Barrels Shop~
   The musty smell of dried timber fills the air of this neat and 
tidy cooper's shop. Aside from the numerous barrels, casks, vats 
and tubs which are present the only other feature is a large 
counter which divides the shop in two. The counter is very wide 
and doubles up as a workbench. Strewn across the surface are a 
variety of tools, slats and hoops. Behind the counter against 
the wall, lying on their sides, stacked neatly upon each other 
are rows of large barrels and casks. The barrels and casks are 
all identical in size, but vary in quality and construction. 
Along the front of the counter are arranged smaller barrels 
amongst the multitude are firkins for packing butter, salted fish 
and distilled spirits. Buckets, churns and a variety of tubs 
have been hung from iron hooks around the side walls of the shop.

from which hangs a large chandelier.

Spacious Foyer~
   The antechamber of the previous room opens out into a massive 
great hall. Once the scene of banquets and feasts the hall has 
now been partitioned by a number thin plaster walls, to form 
three large rooms - joined by doorless archways. Standing in the 
central portion of the great hall a large staircase can be seen 
which leads up to the first floor balcony. The staircase and 
walls are faced with white marble slabs and the floor with 
smooth, highly polished oaken planks. The staircase is bordered 
by elegant brass handrails.

the grand staircase of the building. The decor is simple and 
plain with large marble slabs lining the walls and a polished 
mirror-like surface of oaken planks forming the floor. Hanging

The Attic Corridor~
   A long corridor passes the length of the building. The 
corridor is made of solid grey stone and has no decorations. 
There are large sconces upon the walls designed to hold tall 
candles. The dim light of the candles lights the corridor both 
day and night.

   Beds of all sorts dominate the north and south walls of this

personal affects atop the linens and tucked beneath the frame. 
The beds are arranged so as to provide a slender aisle through

Private Living Quarters~
   This small room is rather cramped. It is meant to function as 
the bedroom, kitchen, and every other room in a normal house. A 
stove is shoved against the northern wall, a small chimney 
leading up through the roof. A bed is shoved nearby, and a 
rickety table occupies the rest of the remaining space. The 
floor is made of squeaky pine planks, while the walls are made of 
cedar, like the rest of the attic. This room is completely 
unadorned, lacking even a window.

Merchant's Way~
   Two large shuttered windows have been set into the front wall 
of the building to the north, kept closed. Merchant's Way is 
wide enough here for carts to pass one another without straying 
to close to the city walls or the buildings facing the walls. 
The folk that pass on foot are a mixture of social classes, each 
though is here intent on visiting the shops and peddlars that 
inhabit and trade upon Merchant's Way.

A Large, Torch-Lit Cellar~
   This cellar has been built to cover the length of the tavern 
above it, constructed with well-fitted stone walls and a smooth 
floor of heart pine. The staircase leading up to the trapdoor 
has been built from rough cedar, contrasting with the neatened 
floor-space, and noises of the tavern can clearly be heard 
through the roof. Two archways are set in the room, one leading 
northward and one leading to the south.

A Crude Hallway, Ending At Two Doors~
   This hallway has been roughly hewn from the soil, cedar boards 
pressed against loose soil and reinforced with thick planking. 
The ceiling is made of the same material, and a brass lantern 
hangs from one of the ceiling planks, attached to a rusting iron 
hook. To the east and west are two identical doors, thick oak, 
the wood dented and scratched.

A Cramped Bedroom~
   This tight room, roughly a square, has been lined with rough 
cedar boards and reinforced with thick planks. The floor is 
uneven, and in one spot, a damp root has worked its way between 
the boards. A cheap job of white paint has, long since, been 
applied to these walls, and peels in long strips. The lantern 
hangs from a rusting iron hook in the center of the room, and the 
room's ceiling is barely above the height of an average man.

Outside the Rath Celerdain Forge~
   Looking to have been newly replaced, the cobblestones of the 
street here are as yet unaffected by the large amount of traffic 
over them, both on foot, and by the wagons drawn by great draught 
horses that pull in and out of the gates of the Rath Celerdain 
Forge. The wagons usually pulled by teams of four horses enter 
the establishment heavily laden with metal ore, coal and lumber 
for the fires of the forges and leave with smelted and refined 
ores. Smoke wafts from the west filling the air with a choking 
cloud that limits vision and stifles the sense of smell.

A Large Chamber With A Fighting Ring~
   This large chamber has been crudely hewn from the soil, its 
floor made from rough, uneven stone. The walls have been shorn 
up with thick cedar planks. Throughout the room, thick beams 
shore up the ceiling, which is a mere crisscross of cedar boards, 
the soil clearly visible through them. In one area, a small 
glimpse of cobblestone can be found, hinting that this chamber 
has expanded beyond the tavern's reach. The center of the room 
houses a sparring ring, and many rows of benches have been set up 
on all four sides.

Courtyard of the Rath Celerdain Forge~
   The gates open wide into a great courtyard which doubles as a 
shop and a storage area. Massive stacks of lumber and heaps of 
coal are piled to the south, workers scurry back and forth trying 
to feed the fires of the forges beyond the doors to the west. A 
thick cloud of smoke bellows from the west covering the yard 
floor in soot and staining the white walls a smoky grey colour. 
The left-hand portion of the courtyard has been covered with 
numerous wooden pallet boards, each has stacked upon it a 
different grade, alloy or pure metal pile of ingots. Wains and 
wagons line the centre of the yard loading and unloading goods.

allowing in plenty of light, this shop perfectly highlights the

room. Hanging from the ceiling is a large but simple chandelier, 
bathing the space in a soft glow whenever the sun is down. Heavy 
drapes along the northern wall mark the entrance to a small

decorative stonework. The stairs are flanked with iron handrails 
twined to resemble ivy vines and leaves. A picturesque window, 
decorated with a windowbox, is to the right of the door, allowing

landing. A set of lavender curtains frame the window.

Upon Rath Celerdain~
   The buildings that line the busy Lampwright's Street recede 
and a large, old marketplace opens up to the west. A few beggars 
line this busy road, and the residents of the area are clearly of 
lower income than those that dwell farther north. Hugging the 
road on its eastern border is the majestic outer wall of the 
city, rising high, thick and impenetrable.

Lobby of the Left Turn Lodge~
   While the interior of this senescent building is somewhat 
rundown, it is quite well cared for. Off-white walls stretch 
down from a high ceiling, and the floor is made up of cracked, 
slate grey tiling. Two doors of seemingly sturdy stock serve as 
entry ways here, one to the east leading outward and another one 
tucked away in the corner on the northern wall. 
   A shoddy, yet well-shined maplewood staircase runs along the 
back of the room leading to the rooms above, its railing a tad 
loose and moveable.

bench~
   Of grand design, this bench has seen better days. Intricate 
carvings of ships and the sea have been ravaged by time and 
misuse. Despite this, however, some attempt at restoration has 
been made. The worn wood is polished and free of any sort of 
debris. It provides ample room for seating, but is far from 
comfortable with its tough wooden surface.

stairs~
   Of generous width and length of tread, these stairs sweep 
along the back wall of the room, leading the eye upwards towards 
the second floor landing. The stair plays host to a 
wobbly-looking railing and a well-worn look, provided by 
countless feet pounding the treads. Along the center of the 
stair, the wood is worn, but both the steps and the railing bear 
a high shine, evidence that they are well-maintained despite 
their age and evident former neglect.

Narrow Streets Winding North of an Old Market~
   The cobblestones here are stained dark red with the blood and 
guts that used to slop here when the Great Market bustled to the 
south and hundreds would pass these narrow streets to buy and 
sell. Now, after the Great Storm and the flooding, there is 
little traffic here apart from the destitute and those who live 
here, staring out of the dilapidated buildings from the top 
floors or throwing out slops from their attic windows.

Narrow Streets Near the Second Circle Wall~
   The buildings surrounding this narrow street are tall, 
obscuring most of the daylight during the day, even that which 
illuminates the area touching upon only the sides of the walls. 
Apart from the occasional alley scavenger or rat, there is little 
traffic here and the gentle noise fills the alleyway from the 
main road which can be seen not far off to the east. Snaking off 
to the north, a small alleyway can be seen, though the darkness 
beyond stops you from seeing how long it is.
   A decrepit, off-white building rises up to the west, half of
its wall covered in thick moss.

Herman's Farm-grown Vegetables~
   The large tent has thin, waxed burlap walls, which is roomy 
enough for several people to stand in at once. A counter 
separates the customers from the owner of the tent. Displayed 
rather haphazardly across the long counter and in boxes scattered 
upon the floor is a large array of farm-grown vegetables. There 
is no great order or system to the displays, the whole 
arrangement appearing completely chaotic. A dented tin lantern 
dangles from a crossbeam, swaying gently whenever the tent is 
shaken by strong winds.

The White City Orchard~
   This large market tent can accommodate nearly a dozen customers 
and still have room for a long counter and all the stock. 
Arranged in stripes of bright vivid colors upon the counter sit 
row upon row of soft and stone fruit pundits. The smell of these 
sweet, ripening fruits dominates the senses. Laying around the 
edge of the tent and along the foot of the counter are baskets 
and bushels of top fruits. A dozen varieties of different 
colored and shaped apples and pears make a visually pleasing 
display. The floor of the tent is pristine and immaculate without 
a single piece of litter or rotten fruit lying upon it.

Merchant's Way by a Perfumer's Shop~
   The sweet smells of perfume waft out across the street from a 
small, trim and neatly kept shop to the north. This pleasant 
aroma makes a change from the smell of rotting refuge and horse 
manure which usually taints the air of the Merchant's Way. Folk 
tend to linger outside the shop as much to take in the delicate 
scents and refresh their senses than to actually window shop or 
enter the establishment. City guards are often seen lingering 
outside the shop chatting and passing orders.

End of a Short Street~
   The short street comes to an abrupt end here, the stone side 
wall of a building rising up to prevent any passage further to 
the north. A few modest shop line either side of the street, one 
large one in particular standing out from the rest to the east 
though it's vacant windows allude to its current disuse. Very 
few people appear to venture this far up the street and it is 
quiet even during the middle of the day.

Start of a Side Street~
   Leading away from the junction to the south, a quiet cobbled 
street stretches away here towards the north. While there is 
little pedestrian traffic an observant onlooker might notice the 
high proportion of passers by that wear armour and the garb of 
borough guards. The long row of lamp posts that burn brightly at 
night are the only standard decor in this otherwise drab and 
uninteresting part of the city.

Within a Deserted Marketplace~
   Collapsed stalls litter the area here, ever shaded by the 
awnings that have been built out from the city wall to cover the 
majority of the area, blocking the plaza from the sun. Barely a 
breeze passes through the area and when it does, it occasionally 
carries upon it a light stench of sewage and trash.

The Cheese Tent~
   The strong odor of cheese fills this large tent. Along the 
counter, neatly arranged are a multitude of cheeses. The cheeses 
are sold in wedges or as whole giant wheels. A mixture of 
colours, textures and or course aromas make each batch of cheeses 
unique. The tent is kept clean and tidy despite the constant 
comings and goings of customers. The strong burlap fabric keeps 
the tent cool during the summer months and prevents the customers 
from freezing during the coldest of winters. Hanging from the 
main supporting pole in the centre of the tent is a large brass 
lantern proividing adequate illumination.

A Spacious Kitchen~
   The walls and ceiling of this room are covered by light brown 
wooden panels apart from a yard-wide stripe of ceramic tiles on 
the southern wall that is starting at hip-height. In the 
northeast corner the rows of dark wooden boards of the floor are 
interrupted by the flight of winding stairs leading down. Right 
next to them is a steep ladder that may be used to access a large 
trapdoor in the ceiling. The glassed windows in the western wall 
let a decent amount of light into the room, but the noise coming 
up from the street below can be heard even when they are closed.

   The design of this bedroom is rather plain and expedient. The 
only decoration is a ledge in the middle of the walls that 
seperates the dark-stained panels of the lower half from the 
light ones of the upper half and the ceiling. When the door is 
left open the smell of cooking and prepared meals wafts into the 
room.

Cherry Blossom's Produce and Dairy~
   This sturdy wooden shop is part of a much larger building. 
The walls are painted white, looking well kept. Numerous shelves 
lining the walls are stacked with all manner of produce and grain 
which vary from season to season. Along the southern end of the 
shop assorted dairy goods, cream, and cheese can be seen. Not 
all of these appear fully cured and some have been pushed into a 
corner of the shelves, doubtlessly to age until they're ready for 
sell. A door is set into the back wall of the shop, while a 
larger door with a window beside it leads out into the street. A 
cedar trim lines the window. Carved into the trim are several 
flower buds and cherries, lending a modest decorative flare to 
the appearance of the shop.

A Large Workroom~
   In contrast to the front of the shop more attention appears to 
have been given to practicality than appearance and decor. A 
large workbench lines one of the walls along its entire length, 
small piles of sawdust visible in one corner. Along the other 
walls cabinets and shelves have been set in place various tools 
and utensils lining them. Oil lamps hang from the ceiling 
providing ample light during all hours of the day and night. 
Beyond the staircase leading further into what is likely the 
living quarters of the shop, another door can be seen.

   With only a single oil lamp which is kept lit all hours of the

leaving only enough walk space between them to allow easy access. 
They are stocked with all manner of assorted produce, grains and 
dairy and doubtlessly used by the shopkeeper as backstock for the 
main room of the shop. A single door leads out into the rest of 
the shop.

hang around a single window in the east wall overlooking the 
street below. The tops of trees lining the Rath Sinth can be 
seen outside the window when conditions allow. A very narrow oak 
trim with a carved leaf pattern runs horizontally along the walls 
and is dyed giving it a rich dark color matching the floorboards. 
A single door set into the west wall leads out of this moderately 
sized bedroom.

A Moderate Sized Kitchen~
   A wooden staircase ascends to the second floor of the shop 
below opening up into a wide kitchen. While most of the walls 
are wooden like the rest of the shop, the west wall has been laid 
entirely of brick. Inlaid into it is a fireplace providing 
warmth and a place for cooking. The bricks themselves have been 
painted white, matching the plaster coated wooden walls of the 
rest of the room. Oil lamps hang from both sides of the kitchen 
providing light during all hours of the day and night. A sturdy 
ladder mounted into a corner of the northern wall ascends through 
a trapdoor in the ceiling while a staircase descends to the first 
floor of the shop. Doors in the south and eastern walls lead 
into other rooms. Cabinets, pantries and shelves on both sides 
of the doors provide ample storage space for pots and various 
cooking supplies. There are no visible windows.

through the light coating of paint, though the walls are mostly 
smooth to the touch. About waist high there is a board that runs 
around the room with cows, chickens, rabbits and horses carved in 
every few feet. On the eastern wall there is a nice sized window 
with a padded wooden bench attached to the wall under it.

Roof-Top Garden~
   A trap door opens onto a flat roof with plenty of room for 
potted plants. A small covered storage bin has been built on the 
north part of the roof where some garden tools can be kept. All 
around the edges of the roof is a brick enclosure that is no more 
than a foot high. A rough wood bench is placed to the south side 
of the roof beside a room just barely a man's height. Some very 
large pots containing various plants and and larger shrubs line 
the outer wall of the roof. To the east another room has been 
built onto the roof. While large enough to provide comfortable 
living quarters, it does not completely hide any view of the 
beautiful tree lined Rath Sinth beyond it. Running diagonally 
from the southern and eastern door is a triangular overhang which 
also barely overshadows the trapdoor, providing moderate shelter 
from adverse weather.

market outside. The tent is kept clear of all obstructions. 
There are no stacks of bushels scattered about, just a single 
long wooden counter which runs the length of the tent. A sample 
of each of the grains for sale is kept in a basket upon the 
counter. The market trader dips under the counter to dispense 
the wares to the customers. Occasionally a market porter brings 
into the tent a bushel of cereals and replenishes the under 
counter area.

A Lavishly-Decorated Lounge~
   This large room, entirely panelled in fine, smoothly-sanded 
and darkly-varnished oak, has obviously been devoted to the 
exploration of comfort. Silk tapestries hang from the walls, and 
several fine throw rugs cover the floor in artfully-arranged 
places. Thick couches and sets of chairs have been arranged. In 
the northern wall is a large stone fireplace. The people who 
frequent this lounge are all very well-dressed, and speak in 
quiet, business-like tones.

A Somber Meeting-Hall~
   This fair-sized meeting hall has obviously been designed to 
put practicalities and business before comfort. The eastern half 
of the room has been raised into a dais, and a long table sits 
atop it. A smaller table sits on the lower half of the room. 
The room is all of finely-planed oak, though there is no 
decoration. There is a somber cast to the area, and an 
understated elegance.

The Main Entry of the Hosteler's Fellowship~
Although sumptuously-appointed, the main chamber of this Hall
is somewhat small and compact, lending it a distinctly cozy 
and nestled feel. Plush carpets of the deepest blue absorb part 
of the air's chill, and rich tapestries cover most available space
on the walls, providing pleasant distractions from any business 
currently at hand. A variety of tables and chairs are scattered 
about for those who linger here, and a hearth has been set into 
the eastern wall to provide light and warmth. A door set into the
western wall leads further into the Hall, while the eastern door
leads back out onto the street.

carpet paves the way westward to a set of great, double doors. 
Tapestries and bas-reliefs flank the corridor, revealing the 
faces and names of the greatest of the former masters of the 
fellowship. Silvered lamps hang from the ceiling, illuminating 
the hallway from above. Two doors stand sentry opposite one 
another, one leading south, the other north.

fellowship. Plain furniture adorns the room, centered around a set of plain 
desks piled high with paperwork.  Three glass windows allow sunlight into 
the chamber and give a view of the street outside.

Spacious and airy, this office is richly decorated and well kept.  
A solid-oak desk sits as the centerpiece of the room, flanked on 
both sides by ovular stained glass windows.  A small alcove is 
carved into the eastern wall, holding all manners of licquer and 
food items fresh from the kitchens.  A similar alcove is carved 
into the opposite wall, creating a small hearth with a flue at 
its top.  A thick carpet of royal blue and scarlet reflects the 
brighter colors in the stained glass windows.

Floored in polished stone, this rectangular hall is large enough to 
fit a host of guests.  Two parallel long tables run its length and end 
at the foot of a raised dais where sits the head table.  Two large 
chandeliers hang from the ceiling, lending their light to the large 
fireplace that sits in center of the southern wall.  A pair of heavy, 
double-doors with bronze knockers lead south.

hard-wood walls that spring from the marbled, stone floor.

A Large Well-Maintained Kitchen~
This large kitchen with a vaulted ceiling, is the hub of activity for 
the fellowship.  Large tables sit in the center of the room for the 
cutting and preparation of all manner of dishes.  A large spit lines 
the western wall, long enough and thick enough to hold three roasting 
boar, tail to snout, over a bed of hot coals.  A half dozen brick kilns 
line the eastern wall, interspersed with cauldrons hanging from hooks 
or sitting on tripods.  Smoke and grease have blackened the walls into 
a dirty sheen.  The smooth stone floor funnels slightly to an iron grate 
located in the center of the room.

corners of the room, while hooks hang from the ceiling - carrying all

heavily used room.  Large shelves line each wall and end at a large set 
of barred, double doors that lead to a loading dock in the allyway.

   Three walls of this room are painted a lovely oceanic scene, 
various sea life abundant and hidden throughout the murals. On 
the fourth wall, a mural is cleverly painted depicting a sunset 
encompassing a dome shaped fireplace of red brick. The floor is 
deeply stained a dark blue color as well, nearly black in hue. 
Along the ceiling runners of midnight-blue silk go from 
wall-to-wall, adorned with shimmering silken opalescent stars 
that seem to sparkle as a gentle warm breeze wafts through the 
room. Suspended from the center of the room, is a soft feather 
bed attached by thick woven silken cords from each corner.

Commons of the Wizard's Cafe~
   A constant hum of conversation lingers within the common room, 
coming from the various patrons surrounding the strategically 
placed furniture, easy to find in order to take a seat, but out 
of the way so those stumbling through won't find them 
unfortunately with a shin. Hardwood floors, stained blue, echo 
the footsteps of those passing through, and silvery gray stars 
hang at different heights from the tall ceiling above. Adorning 
the walls are several flattened wizards' hats of various colors 
and sizes, the majority surrounding the window to the east, just 
beside the entrance leading from Rath Sinth. The sounds of 
conversation and the clinking of glasses can be heard to the 
south in the dining area, while the west echoes the sounds of 
laughter and music at the bar and stage.

A Pantry~
   The only light being a dim lantern against one wall, this room

taller, and bins are lined neatly against each wall, allowing for 
a lot of storage. The room also seems a bit cooler than the 
kitchen, which lies through the eastern door.

A Damp Cellar~
   This damp, spacious cellar has room for a multitude of casks 
and other foodstuffs requiring a moist, cool place. The hewn 
stone floor and walls make this underground space a good deal 
colder than the rest of the tavern. The floorboards above groan 
under the weight of people walking upon them from time to time, 
though a thin stone column with a small ivy pattern engraved on 
it stretches from the smoothed floor to the ceiling, ensuring 
structural integrity.

   The large windows opening outwards into the street to the east 
provide the patrons of the dining area with a good view of the 
busy citizens of Minas Tirith that constantly traverse the Rath 
Sinth. Several strategically-arranged torches keep the room 
well-lighted, creating a pleasant evening atmosphere. Loyal to 
the name of the cafe, the walls are covered in decorated, though 
sun-bleached tapestries that portray classic images of wizards, 
dressed in pointy hats, and holding twisted gnarled staves. To 
the north is the common area and to the west can be heard the 
sounds of a busy kitchen crew.

Main Hall of the Wizard's Cafe~
   Laughter fills the room, coming from the patrons surrounding 
the bar. The same blue hardwood floor from the common area 
stretches into this room, providing a perfect place for dancing 
in the large clear area surrounding the stage. On the outskirts 
of the dance floor are scattered round tables with accompanying 
chairs. The walls are adorned with several paintings depicting 
sparkling stars nearer the ceiling, and a bar scene just below, 
featuring patrons sitting at the bar, dancing, chatting, and 
raising their tankards into a toast. Behind the stage are 
scattered paintings of various types of instruments. To the east 
the constant murmur of conversation is evident in the common 
room, and to the northwest is a tall spiral staircase, leading to 
a second floor. To the west is a small guarded door.

   A long hallway stretches toward the west, ending abruptly in a

adding to the odd silence of the area, compared to the bar down

A Private Office~
   This well-kept office is clearly a man's retreat, dominated by 
the large, bear-skin rug that lays across the floor, as well as 
the sturdy, plush furnishings. The wooden panels have been 
stained darkly, and give the room a refined, intimate feel. 
Serenely quiet more often than not, except for the occasional 
muffled outbursts from below, it's the ideal hide-away for a busy 
man. To the south a large window is set into the wall, allowing 
one to look down on the patrons below. To the west a heavy 
reinforced door is, to the south windows overlook the downstairs.

The Hallway's End~
   A long hallway stretches toward the east, this end containing 
a scattering of colored doors, their brighter colors contrasting 
the familiar deep blue of the runner and walls. To the north is 
a light blue door, painted with stars over its surface. To the 
west lies a red door, dotted every so often with colorful crystal 
balls. To the south is a green door, slight color differences 
giving it a smoky, or cloudy, sort of finish.

The Wizard's Cafe - The Upper Lounge~
   Spiral stairs lead in and out of this bright and elegant 
lounge. In the center of the room is a circular mini bar, the 
tender nestled comfortably in the center. On every wall of the 
octagonal room is a large bay window, lending the patrons a 
picturesque viewpoint of the city. Surrounding the windows on 
each side are open flamed lamps, providing light to the exquisite 
room, even when the windows frame the beauty of the night sky. A 
lush, deep blue carpet muffles both the sounds from the lower 
floors, and the sound of footsteps of those moving about the 
room.

Before the Stairs of the Jailhouse~
   A bleak and wholly un-artistic construction of stone before 
the sky rises up in a similar fashion to the towering walls of 
the third circle of Minas Tirith to the south. An iron fence 
approaches from the east and west and turns, moving up along the 
broad, dull white, stone stairs that lead up to the two great 
doors of the jail, which have been secured with a heavy iron 
padlock, hung from the length of thick chain which has been 
looped through the door handles. Only the barest of people move 
by in front of the building, the tall lamp posts throwing out 
their light un-needed. Jailhouse Walk continues east and west 
alongside the jailhouse.

Merchant's Way Guard Post~
   This building is a single, simple room, constructed from white 
stone. This outpost is manned both night and day and has been 
situated here in order to provide protection to the shops of the 
south-western portion of the first circle. Two large shutters, 
each bearing a secure bolt, provide a view onto the street of 
Merchant's way to the east. A small lamp hangs from the ceiling 
providing illumination and a few simply furnishings allow the 
occupants some comfort.

An Underground Brewery~
   A massive, meticulously maintained brewery has been built into 
the earth here. The walls, carved out of solid rock and earth, 
have been paneled with stained oak planks that help the room 
retain the hot, humid atmosphere required for the trade performed 
here. A simple shaft carved into the wall, which disappears 
after many feet, offers the room's only ventilation. The floor 
is inset with smooth, neatly arranged stone flags with a large 
drain in the center of the room for excess water or spillage to 
be mopped into. Several thin stone columns, with a looping star 
pattern engraved on their surface, stretch from the smoothed 
floor to the ceiling and ensure structural integrity. 
Meticulously maintained, it looks as though this room is kept as 
clean as possible with what some might consider compulsive care.

The Main Entry Of The Malred Tenements~
   Extremely clean, this entryway seems very well taken care of, 
not even the corners bearing a speck of dust. The walls are a 
cheerful sky blue, and the floor is lightly stained wood. To the 
north the sounds of clinking utensils can be heard in the 
kitchen, and westwards leads to the common room. The door 
leading to the street is to the east. A stiff mat lies near the 
door, the only part of the room showing a bit of dirt and mud 
from the people passing through.

its purpose well. The walls are a plain white color, and the 
floor is made of easy to clean hardwood. A small window lies

pausing to enter a shop or merely to glance at the wares on 
display in the shopfronts.

A Narrow Corridor~
   A steep, winding wooden staircase at the northern end of this 
narrow corridor leads up to the second floor of lodgings and back 
down to the alehouse common room. Just wide enough for two 
average size men to walk shoulder to shoulder; scuff marks mar 
the freshly plastered and painted, drab-beige walls. Unevenly 
stained, rough-hewn wood plank floorboards are covered by a 
shoddy, grey wool rug that runs the length of the hall. Dimly 
illuminated any time of the day or night, light shed by a few 
tarnished brass wall sconces flickers with any passing movement 
or draft. The aroma of cheap ale and middling fare hang in the 
air; the lively sounds of boisterous patrons filters up from the 
alehouse below. Doors to the east and west lead to private 
alehouse lodgings. The corridor continues to the south.

   The upper reaches of the corridor's gabled ceiling remain

day or night; light shed by a few tarnished brass wall sconces

the renovated building is considerably quieter than those 
downstairs; the faint aroma of pipeweed smoke lingers in the air. 
Rinky-dink lodgings are accessible via doors on the east and west 
side of the narrow hall. The corridor continues on to the south

places along the length of the hall, suggesting the clumsy 
movement of large pieces of furniture. The upper reaches of the 
corridor's gabled ceiling remain shrouded in constant shadow. 
Dimly illuminated any time of the day or night; light shed by a 
few tarnished brass wall sconces flickers with any passing 
movement or draft. A shoddy, green wool rug that runs the length 
of the hall covers unevenly stained, rough-hewn wood plank 
floorboards. This upper floor of the renovated building is 
considerably quieter than those downstairs. Rinky-dink lodgings 
are accessible via doors on the east and west side of the narrow 
hall. The corridor continues on to the north.

A Dingy Brown Room~
   Far from luxurious, this shabby room's plaster walls and 
sloped ceiling are coated with a thin layer of dingy-brown paint. 
Unstained, rough-hewn wood plank floorboards are covered with a 
matching dusky-brown wool rug. Barely large enough to hold a few 
pieces of furniture, the shabby decor and lack of open floor 
space create a close, hemmed in atmosphere for its occupants.

Outside a Large Compound~
   The street here is dominated by the large compound that looms 
up to the west. Broad, high walls rise up further than the 
buildings one either side, ending with crenellations behind which 
armoured forms can be seen passing occasionally. A pair of wide 
iron gates have been set into the wall to the west and two 
identical banners have been placed a few paces either side of the 
gates, each made of fine burgundy cloth and depicting a sword and 
crown emblem. A little way behind the western wall a towering 
building of white stone can be seen stretching towards the sky, 
dwarfing anything else in this part of the first circle.

Merchant's Way by a Grocery Store~
   The road turns abruptly back towards the outer walls of the 
city. There is a steady stream of folk moving along Merchant's 
Way both day and night. The character of the road changes 
somewhat after this turn, the number of dwellings increases and 
the number of shops decrease. Directly to the north a rather 
large shop dominates the street, a large sign, hanging above the 
door, indicates groceries are sold within.

Greenleaf Winery~
   The walls of this shop have been planked with roughly-hewn 
boards of red oak, the rich grain accented by a dark stain. A 
well-laid floor of pine planking bears the tell-tale signs of 
wear between several rows of cherry-wood wine racks which contain 
a vast array of bottles, both light and dark. Along the north 
end of the shop, stands an ornately-carved counter, which acts as 
demarcation between the public and private areas of the building. 
Several dark barrels, topped by smaller casks have been stacked 
along the western wall, near a sturdy table. To the north, a 
wooden door stands adjacent to a set of wide windows which 
overlooks the cobbled roadway. Set in the southern wall, behind 
the counter, is a wide oaken door stained a deep umber.

A Modest Living Room~
   The broad expanse of this large, yet modest living room allows 
for a large group of people to gather in relative comfort. The 
floor is of stripped hardwood, well-kept and recently varnished, 
atop which rests a thread-bare area rug of hunter green. Rustic 
timbers span the entire distance of the room's ceiling and the 
walls are sheathed with a lightly-stained white oak. Several 
furnishings are scattered throughout the room and a simple 
tapestry hangs from the eastern wall, adjacent to a large 
fireplace of white stone. A wide, oaken door stained a deep 
umber is set in the southern wall and opposite, to the north, a 
simple curtain of dark gray hangs within a passageway.

A Small Kitchen and Workroom~
   This small, yet well-kept room serves dual purpose, acting as 
both kitchen and workroom. The bulk of the space is devoted to 
counters, which line the western wall, which is topped by a 
small, four-paned window. Well-worn, unfinished boards underfoot 
betray the constant activity within this room, deep scratches and 
wear lending character. The walls are painted a simple white, 
brightening the room, though near the stove set along the 
southern wall, the wall has become a bit dingy, due to years of 
cooking. A simple doorway leads northwards, framed by a simple 
curtain of dark gray. Within the western wall is set a small 
door of white oak, stained a peculiar shade of green. Adjacent 
to the stove, a spiral staircase leads both up and down, while 
set within the southern most end of the eastern wall is a wide, 
oaken door.

A Private Bedroom~
   Well-laid strips of smoothly-sanded and varnished red oak make 
up the floor of this multi-purpose bedroom, lending an air of 
sophistication. The walls are painted a warm yellow, while the 
ceiling has been left bare, revealing the massive timbers of the 
building. A single window, large and treated with a lovely set 
of golden drapes draws the eye to the western wall, allowing any 
who peer through it a glimpse outside. A matching bedroom suite 
of simple pine occupies the southern side of the room, while a 
simple desk and several shelves stand to the north, placed upon a 
circular area rug of dark green. A small door of white oak, 
stained a curious shade of green stands in the eastern wall.

   This spacious room plays host to a number of small beds, which 
line the eastern and southern walls, each of which has a small, 
trunk placed at their foot. Set along the northern wall is a 
series of shelves, placed very near a long table of pine, which 
is ringed by a number of stout, comfortable-looking chairs. The 
bare floor is painted a light gray and has been scuffed and 
scratched through everyday wear and tear. The walls, though 
painted a lovely shade of mint-green are bare, devoid of any type 
of treatment whatsoever. Set in the western wall, near the 
middle of the room, is a heavy door of lightly-stained oak.

A Private Cellar~
   The walls of this cramped cellar are completely covered with 
cherry wood wine racks, which hold a great number of assorted 
wines. The bottles within the racks look to have been 
undisturbed for a great period of time, though the racks 
themselves appear quite clean. An earthen floor adds to the 
ambiance of the small space, lending a rich, musty smell to the 
already heady scents of wines and smoke which linger in the room. 
A grouping of four leather chairs rests in the middle of the 
room, surrounding a small, simple table of knotty pine. Set 
along the northern end of the cellar, a steep and narrow 
staircase leads to a trapdoor above.

A Dark Attic~
   Wide, unfinished boards of aged pine make up the floor of this 
broad expanse of an attic which plays host to a great number of 
shelves and bins which rest along the perimeter. Above, the open 
ceiling stretches high, matching the steep pitch of the roof 
overhead. Heavy timbers span the width of the space, set at 
regular intervals, their surfaces roughly- hewn. Several of the 
timbers are heavily charred, bearing witness to a long forgotten 
blaze. At the northern end of the dark room, a very small window 
allows for a peek to the cobbled street below. At the far 
southern end of the attic, a winding staircase leads both up and 
down, though the passageway through the roof has been long 
boarded over.

A Cool, Dry Cellar~
   The walls of this cool, dry cellar, which spands half the 
width of the building above, are nearly concealed from view by a 
host of dusty wine racks which span their lengths. Within the 
racks, rests a great number of bottles of various sizes and 
colors, most of which are coated in a thin layer of dust. The 
floor of this long cellar is of dark earth, beaten smooth by the 
countless number of people that have trodden its length in the 
past. The rafters, which act as joists for the floor above 
appear quite stout and are decorated with the graceful and 
delicate strands of a great number of spiderwebs. Set at the 
northern end of the cellar, a spiral staircase wends its way 
upwards, disappearing into the room beyond.

   Cobbled streets intersect here, the breadth of Rath Celerdain 
merging with the beginnings of two branches off to either side. 
To the east lies a narrower side-street while to the west an old 
marketplace can be seen. Fluted pillars of white stone, capped 
by intricately-carved statues of forgotten Stewards, mark the 
road to the west though the stones are covered in moss and grime, 
obviously ill-maintained. Citizens and the like pass through 
here and the eastern side-street often.

On Rath Celerdain~
   Rath Celerdain stretches on here, winding gently to acommodate 
the bend of Minas Tirith's outer wall to the east. This portion 
of the Lampwright's Street is crowded with busy thoroughfare 
throughout most hours of the day, the cobblestones of the street 
worn by the passing of horses, carts and pedestrians. 
   A building with a sloping roof is set on the east side of the 
street. Above the door, there is an old-looking mobile 
constructed from old wine bottles of varying color.

Rath Celerdain Stretches Onwards~
   This portion of the Lampwright's Street lowers into a slight 
declination, the white cobblestones well-kept despite the heavy 
traffic. The street lifts again to the east, where it meets the 
base of Tirith's outer wall, this stretch of the towering 
palisade marked by a narrow alcove that houses the statue of a 
tall Steward, his frozen stone hand outstretched. A plaque sits 
on the wall of the eastern building, along with a small statue of 
hands cupped over one another.

marble fountain at the street's centre, the road's traffic parted 
by the worn stone structure.

the cobbles somewhat dingy but well enough kept. Eastward, a

following a relatively straight route. To the north and west, 
the southern end of Minas Tirith's Great Market can be spied, the 
vast collection of carts, barrows and stalls spilling over onto 
the roadside of Rath Celerdain. The white cobbled road continues 
to the south, where it bends westward with the eastern wall of 
the city, the street gently narrowing.

In an Ancient Marketplace~
   What is left of this plaza are a few abandoned stalls and the 
wreckage of what existed here before. The area itself is rather 
dark, the light obscured by the tall buildings of the ravaged 
shops that surround the marketplace. To the west, a large 
portico can be seen, collapsed and broken. 
   In the southern corners of the old market, shady figures do 
business under arched stonework dripping with rainwater most of 
the year theat flows down from the higher buildings to the south.

somewhat dingy but otherwise well enough kept. The occasional 
waft of rot and rubbish assaults the nostrils, though the street 
is generally free of garbage and sewage. What was once a portico 
to the Second Circle to the west is now collapsed, the doors of

   A small dirt path runs east and west here though the gardens, 
wide enough for four people to walk side by side. On either side 
of the path, a small number of of various older trees stand tall. 
Growing, underneath the trees are sparse flowers and bushes which 
have been recently trimmed low, causing the area to look slightly 
bare. The sounds here are soft, usually only the sweet chirp of 
a bird or rustling of a small animal can be heard.

paralleled by thick, green grass. A smaller dirt path juts off 
from the main path and leads northward though the greenery. Old

Corner of the City Gardens~
   Less grasses and small plants grow here as the area becomes 
dominated by larger trees. The dirt path which leads in from the 
west turns here to the north. At the corner of the path a small 
clearing in the trees has been created and is dotted with benches 
and old statues. The majority of the trees outside of the 
clearing has turned to pine, which have created a soft bed of 
needles beneath their canopy. A subtle wind is often present 
here, to which the trees sway gently. 
   To the north and west, the gardens continue, while to the 
east, a small iron gate can be seen.

   The path of stones here, which appear to have been redone
recently, curves here and heads to the west to a large, wooden,
double gate. The area has recently been weeded and nearly stripped
barren. Only tall trees and trimmed shrubs have been left to grow
around the stone pathway. At the curve in the stone path, a much
smaller, dirt pathway progresses off to the east and heads further

from the road to the north. Keeping the two roads separate is a 
cast-iron gate wide enough to barely let a wagon pass through. 
The stone path here advances further south while a smaller dirt 
path trails off to the east into the City Gardens. 
   The area looks to have been recently stripped of weeds and the 
bushes and shrubs throughout have been trimmed down. To the west 
above a few old trees peaks the top of a large greenhouse.

Entrance to the Fellowship Housing Complex~
   Consisting of a series of interconnecting outhouse buildings 
this long sprawling complex of stone and wood structures is the 
home of the Journeymen and Apprentice Fellows of Minas Tirith. 
The forecourt is walled to keep is separate from the City 
Gardens, which lie to the east beyond the tall wooden gates. 
Extensive private gardens lie in the centre of the forecourt with 
small walkways leading through the centre from the gate to the 
main building, and north and south.

Side Street~
   A narrower street than the main Rath Sinth, this side road 
runs between the walls of the bordering shops. Kept lit during 
the day by the shadowed sun, and at night by several interspersed 
lampposts, the road is well traversed, if less often so than 
nearby Rath Sinth.

Side Street~
   This narrow side street dead ends here against the wall of the 
fabled Fourth Circle of Minas Tirith. Comparatively quiet, it 
huddles in shadow during the day, Anor's light doing only what it 
can to reach beyond the wall and illuminate the street. In the 
evening, lampwrights pass on their rounds, bringing a series of 
iron street lamps to life with their flame. Commoners, guards, 
and noblemen travel the street occasionally, passing under an 
engraved bronze sign bearing the image of a Windmill upon it 
which hangs about the western store.

A Lush, Private Garden~
   A gravelled path off from the forecort to the south leads off 
to this private garden, continuing around one side of the small, 
silvan pond until it reaches the steps of an intricately-carved 
gazebo that seems to be the focus of this area. Elegant shrubs 
and greenery grow all around here, spurts of color washing one's 
view from the roses and multitude of other flowers that flourish 
in the warmer months. It is rather quiet here and there is 
little to no traffic, Fellows preferring the more popular 
courtyard to the south.

Medicinal Plants~
   Shelves upon shelves line nearly every bit of free space along 
the walls, on either side of the doors as well as above them. 
The pungent aromas of the herbs, flowers and other plants 
occupying them fill the air, some pleasant and others less so. A 
counter runs the length of the northern wall, with smooth but 
worn wood comprising it. The door westward leads back towards 
the plaza, and the small window set against that wall provides 
some light.

A Storeroom~
   This crowded room is stuffed with packages of herbs, both 
dried and fresh, as well as bottles filled with various pungent 
concoctions. The shelves and cabinets bear old stains, and the 
wooden floor is severely scratched in places. A staircase runs 
along one wall, leading up to a trapdoor. The air is thick with 
a dizzying array of smells, not all of which are particularly 
pleasant.

   This room is filled with plants, the majority of which are as

holds herbs and small containers of seedlings. Beside it are 
piles of soil and some empty pots. The many shelves seem overrun 
with greenery, and the flagstone floor is covered in fallen 
leaves. There is a wooden bench next to the door, providing a 
place to sit and relax.

covered in plush, dark green carpet. A row of beds takes up most 
of the space; at the foot of each one is a small wooden chest. A 
few lanterns hang from hooks on the ceiling, providing just 
enough light to see by. Below the window is a sturdy wooden 
table. Several pots, containing various types of fragrant herbs, 
have been placed upon it. A tall, rectangular mirror occupies 
the far corner. Leading down into the shop is a narrow 
staircase, its steps covered in a patterned runner.

Straight Section of Rath Celerdain~
   Ivory cobblestones clash with dirt and grime here as Rath 
Celerdain plunges deeper and deeper into First Circle's slummier 
half, the cobblestones falling into greater and greater disrepair 
the further north one goes. Shanties, hovels, and the occasional 
majestic manor of crumbling stone border the street to the west 
and east, most nondescript.

A Guard Post~
   This clean, spartanly furnished room only holds the bare 
necessities. A few cots and two desks occupy the western wall, 
while parchments and inkwells lie strewn about haphazardly. The 
southern wall is comprised of weapon racks overflowing with 
swords, spears and the like, while wooden dummies sport excess 
armor. The northern wall consists of a small, stone fireplace, 
providing the guards a place to keep warm and to prepare food. 
The stone floor is covered in a deep red rug, adding a bit of 
warmth to this otherwise cold room. A heavy, iron door lies to 
the north.

A Small Courtyard Before a Manor~
   A long path weaves through the area, from the gate to the 
north to the door to the west. North, a sturdy, black-painted 
iron gate marks the entrance to the Minas Tirith parklands, while 
to the west, the door appears to lead into a manor. The grounds 
are well-kept and cared for, this shown in the condition of the 
stones of the walkway and the plants nearby.

The Reception Hall~
   Stretching westward from the main door to the east, this
large hall stands impressively to guests. Wood paneling has been
hung on the walls, hiding the stone until it reaches the ceiling.
The ceiling shows the hall's true age, with several notches and
scratches developed over a great time. It arches to the center
along with several wooden supports which causes it to look bigger
than it really is. The floor is made up of plain white tiles, which
are cracked and scratched in various areas. Windows span the eastern
and northern walls, which lend ample sunlight during the day.
Through an arched support to the south leads a smaller spacious
room, while to the west is set a large oak door.

   This spacious area is a little smaller than the hall to the

is scratched and marred in various places from the passage of
time. The walls are covered with wood panels and appear fairly
new. The dark stain of the wood adds to the cozy feel of the room.
Plain white tile covers the floor, and stays cool all year around.
A large picture window looks out through the eastern wall into
the park beyond, and lets light pour in during the day.
Archways are set in the northern and western walls and lead to

The Main Hall~
   This impressive hall is made nearly entirely of stone, except 
or several wooden supports which span to the ceiling. On the 
ceiling, the large wooden beams arc slightly with the ceiling, 
which makes the room appear larger. On northern wall, midway 
down the long hall, stands a large stone fireplace which adds 
light and warmth to the room when lit. Set to either side of the 
fireplace is a large square window with dark shudders which 
provide ample light during the day. Upon on the far western 
wall, beside a small closet door runs a wooden spiral staircase. 
The floor is made of plain white tile and shines faintly in the 
light. Both the floor and the walls have small notches and 
scratches spread throughout, but have been scrubbed spotlessly. 
Through the eastern door lies the entrance hall and to the south 
lies a spacious room.

A Modest Bath Room~
   This well-kept bathroom boasts a light layering of stone on 
the floor and on a counter, it usually being cool to the touch. 
Though windows can be opened to allow light in, they are high up 
enough to where none outside could see within--though those 
inside could certainly see out. To the east, a door opens back 
into a large bedroom, while to the north, another door opens into 
the hallway.

   This hallway, lit on either side by artistic sconces at even

stairs. It appears to be relatively well-kept, the carpet 
underfoot showing some wear though it's far from dirty.

A Spacious Bedroom~
   Black carpeting lies underfoot, plush and showing little sign 
of wear. The walls show signs of artistic, careful decorating, 
and the room as a whole appears to be rather well-kept. Two 
doors lead out from the bedroom, one to the study just to the 
north and one to the west, opening into a bath room. Windows 
open to allow light to stream in from outdoors.

A Large Study~
   Spacious and decorated in warm tones, this study has been 
artfully decorated and is carefully kept. Plush, dark-colored 
carpet cushions each step across it, though it appears to be 
clean and untouched by too much human traffic. Along the walls 
are shelves lining the walls, while windows open to allow light 
to stream in from outside. Two doors lead out from here, one 
exiting into the hallway to the west, and the other leading south 
into a bedroom.

A Small Common Area~
   Ill-furnished but reasonably well-kept, this common area 
allows for those living in the dorms nearby to gather here. The 
floor is layered with a light carpeting, showing some use though 
it is kept clean. A window allows light in from both the 
southern and eastern walls, and gives those within the room a 
glimpse of outside.

An Attic~
   Cobwebs adorn the ceiling of this once well-kept house. The 
walls are scarred with pits and cracks in a few places and there 
is some evidence still of the wooden panelling which once covered 
the walls of this old manor house. Not much is left in the room. 
Its looks as if the past owner had taken great care to remove 
even the smallest of fixtures and fittings that could have been 
of value.

Lush Parkland~
   Drooping willow trees let loose their slender branches over 
the soft grass of this parkland, the branches of several birches 
intertwining to form a natural canopy over a small, shallow pool 
set in the centre of this area. A small stone path, paved with 
irregular, grey stones leads up from the east. Past the flora to 
the north the city wall can be seen, branching vines running up 
its surface and mold growing in the cracks between the large 
blocks. To the west a smaller wall rises up, also bounded by 
branches and vines.

neatly kept throughout the year. The fresh scent of flowers 
hangs sweetly in the air, and the occasional squirrel or other

seen large, neat shelves which contain an array of assorted dairy 
goods cheeses, milks, creams and butter among them. Along the 
western wall of the store are large oak bins containing various 
cereals, whilst beneath the window of the shopfront crates of 
carefully arranged vegetables and fruits, lush and appealing to 
the eye. Above the counter small batches of dried herbs hang 
from the ceiling, filling the air with a sweet, lingering scent, 
whilst behind the counter, mounted high upon mahogany shelves are 
casks and bottles of various beverages. A small door of dark 
timber is set in the wall behind the counter, bearing the 
ornately carved image of a windmill.

Crowded Graveyard~
   Countless headstones bearing the names of souls departed from 
this world sit at the head of burial plots within the graveyard, 
yet statues in noble poses or clad in stone armour have also been 
placed about the grass to commemorate the deceased. Limestone 
walls mark the boundaries of the city cemetery, vines growing 
rapidly up and down their stone structure. Cobbled paths lead 
between the rows of the graves, occasionally heading towards 
private family crypts, each securely locked, holding the dead 
within forever more. A white picket fence blocks off the western 
portion of the cemetery here, separating it from the green space 
beyond.

pot, the soil thick and rich, perfect for planting. The gate 
leading into and out of the courtyard lies to the south, a barn- 
type door is to the north, leading to the stables. To the west 
lies a well-kept garden, and a large two story house lies to the 
east, its door accessible through this courtyard.

   The clean scent of horses and hay pervades this entire stable. 
Large enough for numerous horses, plus carriages and tack, it has 
the look of a structure that's stood for a while. It has a tall 
peaked roof with a hayloft. Long, narrow windows along those 
walls let in air and light, but they can be shuttered at need. A 
wooden gate to the north leads to the stalls and a sturdy ladder 
leads up into the hayloft.

open-ended loft. There are several wide gaps between the pine 
plank floorboards, allowing the sounds and odours from the stable 
to waft upward and mingle with the sweet scent of the hay that is 
scattered about. Several bound bales of hay are stacked along 
the far, enclosed end of the loft. Great care must be taken when 
walking near the open end of the loft to prevent a nasty fall to 
the stable floor below. A wooden ladder leads down to the room 
below.

tying them back when the window is open. On the ceiling is a 
painting of a single musician, the leafs of her music blowing 
away in the wind as she darts to try and catch them.

A Comfortable Sitting Room~
   This rather large room seems to be arranged neatly, the cream 
colored walls giving it a comfortable feel. A chocolate brown 
carpet covers the expanse of the entire room, creating a soft 
cushion to muffle the sounds of footsteps. A window is centered 
on one wall, surrounded by thick, deep red curtains.

A Small, Efficient Kitchen~
   The kitchen is simple, yet clean. Everything is placed within 
easy reach of a busy cook, the small room making it perhaps a 
little cramped, but otherwise comfortable. The walls are a 
simple off-white, and the floors are a natural wood color.

A Small Balcony Overlooking The City~
   This balcony is resting over the walls between the second and 
third circles, giving a view of this section of the lower parts 
of the city. Beyond the main gates, the Pelennor fields are 
visible, their expanse stretching all the way to the horizon 
where the fields almost seem to blend into the sky.

A Breezy, Rooftop Garden~
High enough above the street that a clean wind wafts through 
at most times of the day, this open rooftop provides a clear view 
into the bustle of the first circle below.  The immense wall of the 
fourth rises still further behind the building, the top unreachable 
even from this vantage.  The floor here is the roof of a building 
made of sturdy stone, joined and mortared, while a wood-framed 
garden patch filled with soil occupies one corner.  A low wall rims 
the rooftop, preventing accidental falls, while cut channels guide 
rainfall to the edges and then into a gutter system that evidences 
the skill of the engineers that built it. A sturdy trapdoor is set in 
the stone, providing entrance to the rooms below.

A Dank, Stonewalled Cellar~
   A sturdy, hardwood ladder, bolted to the stone wall, descends 
into the bleakness of this one-room cellar. Not unlike an 
oubliette, the chamber is cylindrical, with a dirt floor, and 
smells strongly of mold and stagnant water. A single cheap iron 
sconce provides periodic and irregular lighting, by which can be 
glimpsed ominous hints of black metal apparatus bolted here and 
there into the wall. The only sounds are those made by the 
occupants, and the occasional buzzing of an unseen insect; all 
outside noises are absent here. An iron-banded, padlocked 
trapdoor bars the way above.

An Overgrown Back Lot~
   The ground here is cracked and uneven where a modest flagstone 
path is being mercilessly overtaken by weeds and tough grass. 
Though the squat wooden building to the south is small, this lot 
is smaller, and all but dwarfed by its bulk. Even on very sunny 
days, the surrounding structures cast the area in such dreary 
shadow as to provide ample seclusion for the timid, chattering 
vermin who reside in burrows and nests of refuse near its 
perimeter. The mouth of an underground cellar is covered by two 
incongruously sturdy wood doors, banded in iron, and latched with 
a heavy iron padlock. A high, rickety whitewashed fence 
surrounds the small lot, making the only obvious aboveground exit 
a sturdy oak door set into the facing wall of the adjacent shop.

A Private Office~
   In a kind of methodical disarray, this square room is piled 
high and wide with books, papers, and utensils of all sorts, 
leaving only about half of its interior space for occupation by 
sentient beings. The entire area is brimming with the scent of 
smoke and spice, in some part due to the fraying, moss-green 
homespun curtain covering a window set in the northern wall. A 
dreary blue, elliptical rug woven from soft wool lies in the 
center of the room, giving the appearance of having been trampled 
on for some years. The walls and floors, like those of the rest 
of the building, are made of hard maple, its dark, rich stain 
dulled by use and the passage of time. A heavy oak door, 
filleted gently over the top and banded with iron, bars the way 
eastward.

An Improvised Bunk Room~
   This dim, rectangular room must at one time have been used for 
storing goods; one corner is stacked to the low ceiling with 
nondescript wooden crates, and the darkly-stained maple floor is 
scored and scratched. Currently, however, old and disused wares 
have been shoved aside to make room for a handful of unadorned 
and unappealing bunks. A narrow aisle down the western wall 
continues toward the southern end of the room until it is 
interrupted by a haphazardly discarded collection of split and 
broken pinewood shelves.

A Cramped, Ill-Equipped Kitchen~
   Clearly not a point of particular focus for either the 
engineer or the furnisher of the building, this kitchen is too 
small to admit more than two or three individuals and is 
outfitted rather poorly for its purpose. Evidence of a long 
forgotten mishap is scorched into the underside of the single 
pinewood dish cabinet, hung in solitude above the stove. Despite 
the overall miserable look of the kitchen, it seems to be well 
tended.

A Poorly-Lit Receiving Room~
   Although this room is populated chiefly with space, there is 
not a great deal of it to be had. The darkly-stained maple walls 
and floors are dusty, but not dirty. What furnishings are 
present have been placed with conspicuous precision against the 
walls, leaving an ample path by which to cross the floor and 
reach the adjoining rooms. A fraying, moss-green homespun 
curtain hangs in the southern doorway, a sturdy oak door bars the 
way northward, and an open doorway allows egress to the east. 
The areas smells vaguely of smoke and spice.

A Narrow Hallway~
   Hardly comfortable for two men to pass side by side in, this 
hallway seems almost like an afterthought, partitioned from the 
adjoining rooms at the last moment. It is lit irregularly by a 
single cheap iron sconce which surely illuminates only a handful 
of the scores and chips in the dark maple walls and floors. Set 
into the west wall is a filleted and iron-banded oak door with a 
heavy iron lock, through which emanates the strong smell of smoke 
and spice. Only a few steps across the corridor is a plain, 
rectangular portal barring exit to the east, while sturdy oak 
doors bookend the hallway to the north and south.

The Student's Sanctuary~
   The musty, ancient smell of books and parchment betrays the 
nature of this establishment, the timeworn granite walls all 
bearing a number of pine bookcases. Old but well-kept furniture 
is scattered about on the travel-worn marble floor, mostly 
unoccupied save for a few lingering, generally silent visitors. 
The high, arched ceiling above bears more than a few cobwebs, 
though the fresh woodstain on the furnishings and bookcases, as 
well as the freshly-swept floor, show that this library is still 
cared for.

The Western Platform of the Second Story~
   A rather wide hallway winds it way against the wall along the 
spherical shape of the building. A thick railing carries 
suggestions of lines shaped as ivy vines that creep over the 
railings which root it firmly to the ground. A more solid 
etching of leaves flowering at the very base and rising out of 
the stone itself, the colour of which is a pale, mint-green. 
Every few feet of the railing support circular, bowl-like dips in 
the stone, which have been filled with water that carry drifting 
candles. Vast, thick pillars shoot by the story and continue up 
to the great ceiling above.

The rythmatic sound of rainwater hitting the the building
creates a constant lull to the interior, the liquid creating patterns
where its visible upon the thick glass panels set within the vaulted,
domed ceiling. Long-stemmed, intricately-designed braziers placed evenly 
throughout the room provide a gentle source of yellow light to the 
surroundings, casting long shadows whenever someone passes by. 
The  walls are made of ancient white stone, veins of darker grey 
creeping over its surface. Upon the strong, timeworn walls are a 
large number of framed paintings, some consuming great areas with 
their colours, challenging those smaller in shapes. Maps and 
tapestries depicting faded images, lending to the aged 
atmosphere of the area. A smaller hallway leads from the area.

The Storefront of the Student's Sanctuary~
This room is fashioned of ancient, white stone, the large 
blocks of granite composing the high walls bright and 
well-maintained. The grey-veined, marble floor maintains its 
shine despite the obvious wear with use. A few people linger 
about the area, browsing the various writing utensils, empty 
books, and finished products for sale. Small, arched windows 
allow streams of light to slip into the room during the day, 
providing it with good illumination. An oaken counter with a 
swinging door divides the room in half, crates of supplies 
stacked behind it. Various hallways arch in different 
directions, leading deeper into the womb of the old building.

A section selling art supplies can be seen to the east.

   Dark-stained panels of pine comprise the floor of this room, 
contrasting sharply to the white granite blocks of the 
oval-shaped walls. Bookshelves cover virtually every inch of the 
walls, however, loaded with tomes and books of varying shapes and 
sizes. Desks are arranged here and there in the room, some 
bearing maps of Gondor, Minas Tirith, or unknown lands, and 
others unoccupied. A select few clientele browse the shelves, 
but for the most part, the room remains silent.

Within a Tree-Flanked courtyard~
   Curving oak branches herald shadows to the leaf-strewn 
cobblestones below which the great trees watch over. The path 
past the gate is natural: pale cobbles of silver and grey, 
flanked by a bed of crushed rock and mulch on either side. The 
path leads to an expansive estate of grey stone, fluted pillars 
leading to lattice-shuttered windows engraved with scenes too 
delicate to be seen from a distance. Vines crossing over the 
wrought iron trellis that flanks tall walls spread into the 
branches of surrounding trees, softening the borders between 
artificial and natural structure, and gives a sense of harmony 
rather than incursion. Saplings still reedy and young form a 
small grove around the centerpoint of the courtyard which opens 
up into a circle set with small pebbles of silvery-grey and blue 
which molds a mosiac of ocean waves against a cliff face with 
their layout.

A Small Chandler's Shop~
   This store is small, though it almost seems cozy rather than 
cramped. Its walls and floor are of the same pitted grey-white 
stone as the city, though it has a ceiling of old, worn but 
sturdy wooden beams. Lining the walls are a few dilapidated 
shelves displaying assorted candles, lanterns, soaps, and other 
items for sales. Near the western wall sits a short, cracked 
cedar counter, behind which is a staircase lined with a rickety 
railing, going up, and a door leading to a back room. Looking 
eastward, out into the street, is a long rectangular window.

Cramped Living Quarters~
   Nestled in the cramped confines of the attic, this space 
serves as both a bedroom and sitting room. The scratched cedar 
floor is relatively clean and free of dust; it meets the gently 
sloping north and south walls, which converge high above to 
create the wooden ceiling, slightly dilapidated with age. There 
is a small window overlooking the street, and a door leading to 
the room below. There are a few furnishings: a few faded 
pictures on the walls, and frayed curtains on the window that at 
least lend the room the appearance of being lived in.

Chandlery Workroom~
   This workroom has been designed to be spacious and practical. 
A door leads into another room to the east, and across the north 
and west walls are some dusty shelves and other pieces of 
furniture. Tarnished brass sconces hold lamps which provide 
steady, continuous illumination, and often cast flickering 
shadows across the cedar ceiling. There is a chimney in the 
southern wall, set above a fireplace of pitted grey-white stone. 
A frayed woolen rug has been thrown over the floor, giving the 
room a touch of warmth and comfort.

Chandlery Storage Cellar~
   This relatively square room appears to have been carved out of 
the ground, making it seem somewhat cold and uninviting; the only 
part of it that isn't solid stone is the wooden trapdoor in the 
ceiling. The pitted walls are dull gray in color, and a thin 
film of moisture on their surface allows a few patches of moss to 
take up growth here. There is a thin film of dust covering much 
of the bare floor; the rest of the space is filled with 
cupboards, shelves, and chandlery supplies. The room is musty, 
and the faint smell of wax hangs in the air.

A Shaded, Tree-Lined Garden~
   A gravelled path off from the forecort to the north leads off 
to this private garden. Rather than shrubs and bushes, what 
grows here are a multitude of trees from fruit trees to the shady 
oaks. There are a few benches set here and there for private 
conversation or just an idyllic view of the gardens. It is

   This area is little more than a small patch of dirt fenced in 
by a rickety, worm-eaten and moss-covered wooden rail that does 
little in the way of keeping out unwanted visitors. The building 
to the west appears long-since abandoned, and has a few shattered 
boards in one corner of the rear wall, which offers a limited 
cobwebby view of the interior.

   This narrow space between two buildings fronting Rath Daelond 
is just one of the many alleyways that branch off from the main 
road. There is space for only one person abreast, and the 
tightly packed buildings keep the space in almost constant 
darkness. The very mouth of the alley is clean, but only a few

up against the walls of the buildings. The garbage becomes

   The smell of the putrid garbage that lies deeply along all but 
the very middle of this alleyway threatens to overwhelm your 
senses. The air is tight and close, stagnant from the press of 
the buildings that surround the haphazard path on all sides. The 
scurry of rats is a nearly constant sound as they seek their next 
meal amongst the heaping piles of waste. The alley shows no 
signs of widening as it winds off to the north and south.

underfoot may once have contained cobblestones, but there are 
only a few broken corners showing now amongst the powdery dirt. 
Refuse is prominent on all sides, lining the backsides of every 
house along the road. The house to the east has a large window 
that looks onto the backlot space, but otherwise, stone walls 
surround. The alleyway winds off to the north continuing between

A Shabby One-Room Building~
   A typical slum building, this home has only one large room in 
it. The roof is made of ill-patched thatch, and in heavy rain 
there are a few prominent leaks. The walls show the mark of 
water damage, and the floor is made of rough, unfinished pine, 
making it quite easy for someone without foot protection to catch 
a sliver. In stark contrast to the otherwise shabby room, the 
door of the building is exceedingly well built, made of thick, 
sturdy planks. These planks are capped by a very heavy iron 
lock, making the door a formbidable barrier. Though the space is 
not particularly open, the air in the room is kept fresh due to a 
large window set in the back wall that can be slid open or 
closed.

   This small room looks to have been a later addition to the
manor, as the stone walls suddenly end and are replaced by wooden
walls and floors. A small counter runs along the western wall.
Above it are many pots and pans which are hang on the wail from
nails. In the northern corner, space has been provided for a
stove. With no windows set in this room, the only light 
comes from two small scones set on either side of the door.
Cupboards and pantries line the other walls and fill most of 
empty space, making the room smaller and cramped for the cook.

murals. The smell of Westman's weed hangs heavy into the air of

A Dust-Accumulated, Cobweb-Ridden Warehouse~
   The worn, poorly fitted planks of wood that compose the floor 
of this vast warehouse have been shattered and broken in various 
places. Solid wood beams stretch from wall to wall high above, 
acting as a support for the traingled roof on which various 
creatures have made their dwellings as revealed by the straw and 
leaf nests. Save for only a handful of crates and the odd broken 
stool, this long room is covered in a visible coat of dust which 
seems to have gathered over months. During the daylight hours 
sun glimmers through the high, semi-transparent windows to cast a 
silvery sheen over the abundant cobwebs in the deepest recesses 
of this long warehouse.

crates and a misplaced plank of wood which has been forcefully 
splintered from the floor, the room is home to bulbous spiders 
which find their dwelling in silvery cobwebs in the darker cracks 
of the walls. A dank, musty aroma accompanies the somewhat thick 
air, likely accruable to the amount of dust which has accumulated 
on every surface over what looks like months. Several planks 
have been nailed over the window, restricting any access to the 
outside, but doing nothing to keep the cold air out.

bottles, jars and herbs. Other areas contain rows of glassware, 
piping, and complex equipment unrecognizable to the untutored 
eye. The center of the room is dominated by a large marble slab 
of a table, its hard surface worn by frequent cleansing. An 
array of small pots sits on a tiered shelf near the windows, 
holding a few odd plants and mushrooms. A door to the north 
opens back into the main shop outside.

flawless. Double doors lead out north, into the courtyard.

pair of long skylights on the roof during the day. The resulting

their surroundings, but focuses attention upon the southern wall, 
where a perpetually well-lit stage extends out. 
   Dozens of tables, couches, and seats are clustered in the

A Cozy Library and Study~
   Though the walls are only splashed with a dull-white paint, it 
is only visible in small areas due to the number of shelves, 
desks, paintings and antique objects around the place. An 
archway opens out to a crimson-decorated bedroom whilst a modest 
desk and accompanying chair have been pushed against the northern 
wall. The flooring is dark wood panel that has been glossed and 
centered with a rich brown rug. Both new and tattered books line 
the shelves, their pages housing plays, literature, poems and 
journals from various authors.

A Scarlet-Painted Bedroom~
   The thin wood planks, which have been neatly nailed together 
to create the four walls of this modest room, have been splashed 
with a sharp crimson paint. A similarly colored rug has been 
laid down over the polished floorboards. The room is large 
enough to easily fit a desk, an average sized bed and perhaps a 
few more leisurely items of furniture. A surprisingly detailed 
tapestry, dominantly of green wool, displays a vivid, rich 
portrayal of a forest and hangs above the bed on the eastern 
wall. Two iron grates are set into the wall on either side of 
the bed to lend the room soft light and a relaxed, comfortable 
atmosphere.

   The walls of this large, square-shaped room are whitewashed 
and nicely kept. Though there are no windows in here, it has a 
light, airy feel to it, thanks to a high ceiling. Doors and 
archways stand on all sides, with a staircase leading upstairs to 
a loft.

An Open Lounge and Workspace~
   This large and spacious open room serves as both a sitting 
room and a workarea. It seems a bit jumbled with furniture and 
supply storage on first glance, but it soon becomes apparent that 
it is organized into quadrants. Based out of the four corners of 
the room, each quadrant has a specific function, illustrated by 
the chosen furnishings. One sector houses plush furniture for 
leisure, and flat surfaces, such as tables and desks, are spaced 
around another to accomodate budding writers and sketch artists. 
The third space is lined with easels and small side tables to 
hold paints and still-life models, while the last block of space 
in the far corner of the room has shelves and supply cabinets for 
all to use. Given all the different forms and functions, the big 
room is somewhat cramped, yet cozy at the same time.

An Art and Sales Gallery~
   This offshoot from the foyer is a display gallery of moderate 
size, housing many different works of art. Colorful paintings 
adorn the walls, some of which appear to be for sale, given the 
tags. The flooring is the same whorled marble as the foyer, the 
dark hues accentuating vivid color schemes on many of the pieces. 
A small sales desk is in the far corner of the room, where people 
make offers to buy certain works. Before large performances, 
tickets are also available for advance sale, with prices based on 
seating area.

A Small Garden Behind the Wizard's Cafe~
   This small garden patio in the back of the establishment is a 
haven away from cobblestones and rock walls. Surrounded by 
buildings on all four sides, the area is mostly blocked from 
gales and more severe bouts of weather. A decorative scheme of 
oil lamps on ivy posts ensure the sheltered area stays nicely 
illuminated with soft light. Most of the fauna is green and 
leafy, smattered with a collection of blossoms and petals ranging 
from white to bright, season depending. The flat stones of the 
patio underfoot are white and smooth.

while a narrow window to the east looks down out over the road. 
The room overall is musty and smells of ancient parchment, a 
thick layer of dust covering everything save for the old worn 
table in the room's center, a place for the seekers to work.

The Common Room of a Renovated, Private Dormitory~
   This square room manages to be spartan and pleasant at the 
same time, its off-white walls reflecting the sunlight that pours 
in through windows set into the western wall during the day and 
the warm, flickering light of candles at night. An even coat of 
paint has been recently applied to the smooth granite walls, and 
the floor is swept and uncluttered. Students come and go, 
padding quietly over the soft, pale blue rug that lies in its 
center. Others linger in reflection or quiet conversation, often 
preferring solitary pursuits and rarely disturbing one another. 
The bunkroom lies to the east through a varnished wooden door, 
and a doorway to the north admits the tantalizing scent of 
cooking food during mealtime. To the south, a hallway stretches 
deeper into the building, while the western door leads out onto 
Rath Sinth.

A Quiet Bunkroom~
   This room is austere and calm, constructed with efficiency in 
mind and lacking any formal attempts at decoration. It is 
nevertheless quite well crafted, the off-white granite walls 
painted evenly by a subtle hand. A simple cube with a single 
door cut out of the western wall, it serves its purpose without 
excess. Two rows of bunks are lined up, the first along the far 
eastern wall, the second several paces away, creating an aisle 
between the two while still leaving a pathway along the western 
wall. At most times of the day students can be found sleeping or 
reading in bed here. The only door leads back into the common 
room of the dormitory.

An Ivory Kitchen and Dining Room~
   Brightened during the day by warm sunlight spraying through a 
window in the western wall, this large, granite room, painted 
pale ivory and serving as both kitchen and dining room, is as 
close to a nexus of activity as can be found in this quiet 
building, frequently playing host to the sounds of cooking, 
eating, and pleasant conversation. Enticing scents hang in the 
air perpetually, reminiscent of good cooking and old meals. In 
the morning and evening students congregate to take their 
nourishment together at the long communal table before returning 
to the common room to work or socialize. The wide, rectangular 
doorway to the south leads back into the front room of the 
dormitory.

A Foul-Smelling, Shaded Alley~
   This narrow space between two old, whitewashed buildings off 
of Rath Daelond is occupied chiefly by the waste of civilization. 
Towering above to the west and blocking out all but the dimmest 
sunlight is the great Third Circle wall. Vermin crouch in the 
shadows watching the few who have reason to explore here, their 
beady eyes glittering in the dim light.

A short-lived, white-cobbled sideroad~
   This white cobbled road has a short lifespan, promptly 
terminating at a large, ornamental iron gate to the west, flanked 
by high-rising walls. A small section arches away and leads 
towards a pale, stone building to the south whose wall bears a 
stately sign with an open tome meticulously embellished upon it. 
Large, symmetrical iron lamposts keeps the area well lit with 
lamp flame whenever night or ill weather threatens it with 
shadows. 

Another sign hang besides the open-tome one on the southern 
doorway, this one bearing a paintbrush and canvas on it. To the 
north, an immense building would appear to be under construction.

An Austere Hallway~
   Its granite walls painted an even, sober off-white, this 
hallway is perfectly straight and wide enough for two adults to 
traverse side by side. The granite floor is softened by a long, 
rectangular carpet of pale blue that runs the length of the hall 
and spans the width minus a pace on either side. At all hours of 
the day and night, the warm glow of candlelight dances along the 
unadorned walls and the simple oaken doors on either side of the 
hallway, lighting the way for the trickle of elder students who 
pass through it. The dormitory's common room lies to the north, 
while a narrow, winding granite staircase leads up to a landing 
before a heavy oak door.

unassailed by the sounds of every day life below. The only hint 
of amenity is in the size of the room itself, and the comparative 
wealth of free space it affords the occupant. Apart from the 
oval-shaped pale blue rug arranged in the center of the granite 
floor, the only decoration is an oil-painted cityscape framed in 
rich mahogany. At the north end of the room is a heavy oak door 
leading out to a granite staircase.

distinctive grooves in the stone. Shelves line the walls, and

grey Anduin can be seen from here. To the south and west, a wide 
city street continues.

   This spacious stone room is newly refurbished, a clean coat of 
white paint giving it a wholesome and invigorating atmosphere. 
Even through the paint, each block of stone stands out clearly in 
its place and the quality of the stonework is unmistakable, 
particuarly in the shallow stone wainscoting that runs the 
perimeter of the room. At all times of the day and night, modest 
laborers congregate here or move through from one end of the 
complex to the other. The stone floor is clean and spare, 
leading northward, into the kitchen, and eastward down a wide 
hallway. A heavy oak door to the west leads out onto Rath 
Daelond, and a door to the south closes off the storage room.

   This wide, high-ceilinged chamber doubles as both a kitchen 
and a dining room, the new coat of white paint on its stone walls 
contributing to feelings of openness and freedom. The floor is 
bare but clean, fitting seamlessly under the lip of shallow stone 
wainscoting that runs along the perimeter of the room. A broad 
window overlooking Rath Daelond has been cut out of the west wall 
and trimmed in white stone, permitting a wash of bright sunshine 
to light the room during the day. At night, reserved brass lamps 
illuminate the evening meal. To the south, a simple stone 
archway leads to the lobby of the complex.

another on the north and south walls, where a fresh coat of white

hours of the day laborers in modest dress pad the bare floor, 
often to and from the bunkroom to the north, or west, into the 
lobby of the complex. At the far end of the hall to the east, an 
oak door banded with strips of iron leads out into the garden.

an open, bright place, though the bare floor can hardly be kept 
spotless under such constant activity. The subtle, white stone 
wainscoting which trims the perimeter of the chamber is obscured 
for most of the way by furniture, though it adds a hint of 
decoration where it can be seen. To the south through the simple 
stone doorway, a whitewashed hallway can be glimpsed.

A Cozy, Communal Living Area~
   This intimate room has been constructed of smooth, evenly cut 
stone to which a clean coat of whitewash has been thoroughly 
applied. Though it isn't a large chamber, a certain partitioning 
of furniture employs the available space in such a way as to 
accommodate the personal spheres of two or three individuals 
quite comfortably. Trimmed along the perimeter by subtle, white 
stone wainscoting, the room manages to be homey and spartan at 
the same time. To the north a sturdy oak door dampens noise from 
the hallway beyond.

An Overgrown Garden Behind A Whitewashed Building~
   This cozy lot may once have been a serviceable garden, and 
certainly the soil is fertile enough, but it has clearly been 
many months or even years since it was tended. Weeds creep out 
from under circular white stones, obscuring what may once have 
been a quaint, winding pathway, and tufts of coarse grass sprout 
shamelessly from the ruins of flowerbeds. The perimeter of the 
lot is squared off by a wrought-iron fence from which chips of 
white paint crumble to the ground at the slightest provocation.

A Cramped Kitchen~
   This small kitchen is rather cramped, the walls and floor made 
of grey stones rather dull in color. It barely affords any room 
for the furniture in it, not accomodating for any large amount of 
people. A small river-rock fireplace dominates most of the 
northern wall, a chimney rising up to filter out the smoke while 
a curtained archway to the east leads out to the workroom.

A Dingy Auction Hall~
   This dark and musty square room seems to be converted from a 
section of a disused warehouse. Its walls are cheap pine and the 
floor is bare, with rusty nails sticking up and the debris of the 
slums scattered throughout. Stray animals and children come and 
go through the crowds of Second Circle cityfolk who mill around 
and watch the auctioneer at work, or bring in items for sale. 
Light is provided by old lanterns, frequently fed by those who 
work here, as the room is windowless, often unbearably hot during 
the summer and freezing during the winter.

A Foyer of Ill Repute~
   A house of ill repute indeed. The door to the south hangs 
loosely from its hinges, the lock there rusted and old even as 
the paint peels from the walls from the damp and mildew of this 
once-opulent house. Bits of trash and refuse lay about the 
floor, looking to trip the unwary traveler. The house's history, 
apparently, is far from peaceful as there are several holes in 
the walls which could grant glimpses into the adjacent eastern 
and western rooms, as well as some suspicious-looking stains 
splattered about. The western way is open, an empty, doorless 
doorframe lies to the east, the hallway itself stretching on 
northwards.

Above a Gaping Hole in the Floor~
   Were one to enter this room through the eastern way, the most 
startling feature of this room is the gaping hole in the floor, 
collapsed down into the basement. Wooden planks still protrude 
from the edges of the hole, giving it a rather maw-esque, 
foreboding personality. The walls of this room, once white, are 
cracked and broken with peeling paint, the refuse of such 
littering the floor. The perimeter of the hole is still 
walkable, were one wary. The fall below is no further than some 
ten feet. In a rather ironic mirror, the roof here has also 
collapsed. The debris of both floor and ceiling can be seen 
floating below in some knee-deep water.

Amongst Floating Refuse~
   A chill pool of knee-deep water has filled the basement of 
this old house, bits of wooden refuse floating in it. Stretching 
out in almost all directions lay darkness, this particular area 
illuminated by the light shining down from above. The jagged 
hole in the floor of the above level is easily visible, but some 
ten feet higher than the floor. Gazing straight upwards would 
yield one a clear view of the sky through the holes in both roof 
and floor of the above levels. Often times, large, wriggling 
bodies can be seen moving their way through the water or sitting 
atop some piece of refuse--Rats.

Between Rotting Wooden Supports~
   The knee-high water here makes moving a somewhat troubling 
affair, the nigh absolute darkness of the area compounding this. 
The wooden supports of the above derelict house are scattered 
throughout the area, in various stages of weakening rot. The 
ceiling here seems steady enough, a steady ten feet above any 
traveler's heads. Swirling about the shins of any travelers 
would be various things--bits of wood, sunken pieces of scrap 
metal, and the wriggling, wet bodies of rats. Along the northern 
wall there is the weak, rotting carcass of an old stairwell. 
Slightly to the east and above, light shines down from the above 
floor occasionally. Without any stairs, this escape route has 
been crippled.

Within the Derelict House~
   The house opens up a bit here, offering any occupants a number 
of paths--A termite-feast of a stairwell leading upwards, 
creaking with every step. The once-grand wood of it has been 
tarnished by time and ill treatment, the stairs themselves worn 
threadbare and the wood of the banister scratched and scarred. 
Along the western side of the room the beginnings of a stairwell 
begin before abruptly ceasing. Laying below this, one could see 
the remains of the stairwell, in a dark, water-filled basement. 
Southwards, a door is visible at the end of the hall.

End of a Stagnant Basement~
   Any moving through this area would find their feet rather 
hard-done-by, as the bottom of the foot-deep water is riddled 
with small bits of metal and other junk. The steady, constant 
drip of water can be heard from somewhere nearby, as well as the 
occasional splash from a rat returning to the water. The 
darkness here, to those without their own light, is almost 
absolute, forcing any trespassers to explore more with their 
sense of touch than sight.

A Squalid Living Room~
   Entering from the western way would force any trespassers into 
the building to move between an old doorframe, the rusted hinges 
still visible, despite the lack of their charge. The room here 
is in inarguably squalid condition--Empty bottles and old rags 
lie about on the floor amongst pallets of flea-infested blankets 
or of bare straw. A mostly boarded-up window lies to the south 
of the room. The room is filled with the stench of unwashed 
bodies and other, less savory things. The paint on the walls, 
once a pristine white, has been stained with mildew and filth by 
the room's occupants.

Atop a Rotten Stairwell~
   The stairwell here is utterly unsafe. It creaks with every 
step and edges of the termite- and water-weakened stairs break 
with each heavy step. Having surmounted the deathtrap, however, 
those present could see a heavy, rusted iron door laying flat 
atop the floor at the top of the stairs. The doorway to the 
north is rather ravaged, the hinges seeming to have been 
violently violated. The ceiling of the room is smeared with 
scum, almost as if it had been done on purpose.

A Time-Ravished Bedroom~
   Past the oddly heavy iron door to the south, this room gives 
off an aura of extreme clutter. Any number of random, and rather 
useless, objects lay about on the floor--empty paint cans, knife 
blades with no pommels, pommels with no blades, the odd lockpick 
or two. Resting rather crowdedly adjacent the northern wall, a 
rather delipidated bed sits, covers thrown into a large clump in 
apparent disarray. An aura of dust hangs over most of the items 
in the room, though a few things show recent use, the bed being 
one of them.

A Fiercely-Cluttered Attic~
   This attic is dank and dark, the ceiling itself sagging 
heavily in its once-prim, triangular shape. Mold grows across 
much of the wood, large supporting beams frequently interrupting 
any attempted travel through this area. A section of the roof 
along the northern way has caved in sometime in the past, 
rendering a jagged hole in the side of the ceiling. Easily large 
enough to grant a man passage, the roofs of adjacent buildings 
are near enough to permit a small leap.

The Rooftops of Minas Tirith~
   Standing atop a rather tall building, one has a disorienting 
look down at the ground. While the drop down would probably not 
be lethal, it would certainly be incapacitating. Southwards of 
this particular roof, a hole can be seen gaping, permitting 
entrance to a large house of rather ill repute. This particular 
roof is large and squareish, mostly flat. A few bits of timber 
are scattered about, but the area is generally clear.

Clothwrights Fellowship Hall Foyer~
   This wide foyer is best described as sumptuous. All the 
materials used are rich and comfortable, clearly picked by 
someone with a practiced eye for matching color and comfort. 
The bright white stone of the walls is toned down by tapestries 
depicting grand events in the history of Gondor, all wrought by 
masterful hands. The ceiling is tiled and from it suspends a 
chandelier of gleaming brass that illuminates the whole room. 
The floor is covered in a woven carpet showing artistic 
representations of men and women involved in the subtle craft 
of working cloth.

An Airy Forge and Courtyard~
   This large courtyard on the back of a shoppe, just off the 
First Circle is used as a forge. Covered with a slanting, 
shingled roof, a work area set with a massive forge is protected 
from the inclemencys of weather. The forge has a tall, wide 
chimney of bricks that allows the smoke and fumes from the work 
to escape easily. A yard surrounded by the tall walls that make 
the side of the Second Circle grows some thick grass, inviting to 
cool off from the forge's heat. One can enter back into the shop 
to the south or through a oak door to the west into what seems to 
be a small expansion of the building.

tall, narrow windows leading out to the street in keeping this 
room brightly lit. A single rug lies in the center of the floor, 
its design a masterfully simple yet elegantly wrought image of a 
hammer and chisel.

Woodwrights Fellowship Hall Foyer~
   The walls of this room are made of polished and carved wooden 
panels, creating a mosaic of carved light and dark wood. The 
ceiling is vaulted, set with carved wooden beams depicting 
verious acts of woodworking. The furnishings are, as one might 
expect, of the highest quality of worked wood, ornately and 
masterfully carved over every inch. South, the doors open to the 
Plaza of the Moon.

Leatherwrights Fellowship Hall Foyer~
   The furnishings of this room are simple and elegant, lit by a 
single large wrought iron chandelier that's been lightly etched 
with silver to catch the light. It hangs by a twisted chain, 
firmly anchored to the ceiling, and slowly turns, causing the 
faintest movement in the shadows about the room. The result is 
to give the room an odd sense of life; the colors used are all 
warm and bright, several large windows seem to draw the outside 
in and curtains seem as though they are meant to never be drawn 
shut.

all off to the side to make room for handcarts and other tools 
for moving things of great weight. The chandeliers are all 
ornate and complex wrought iron while the walls are hung with 
metal-worked decorations of all sorts. Copper, bronze, lead, 
pewter, even tin made into displays of what a skilled hand can do

The Foyer of the Jewellers' Fellowship Hall~
   This expansive foyer goes above and beyond in expressing the 
wealth of its creators. Gold fittings, silver chandeliers whose 
glass candle-covers have been set with gemstones sparkle 
briliantly, every place that a masterful display of precious 
metals worked by skilled hands can be fixed has been claimed by 
an example of some jewelers creation. Rich dyed velvets and rugs 
wrought in jewel toned splendor make this room almost blinding in 
its array. The display of wealth is matched only by the 
attention to comfort. The rugs themselves are thick and plush 
while the furnishings are over-stuffed, hung with tassles and 
almost lascivious in their opulant and sensual fittings.

Armorsmiths Fellowship Hall Foyer~
   Though this area's done in white, with white marble flooring 
tiles and white marble walls, any potential calm and serenity are 
belied by the dozen or so suits of armor done in archaic styles 
long ago considered obsolete. Beyind each suit of armor is a 
tapestry depicting the armor being worn in a battle. Bronze 
sconces keep the hall lit at all hours, but during the day, tall 
rectangular windows let in daylight at dramatic cross-angles.

Weaponsmiths Fellowship Hall Foyer~
   Luxurious white marble floor tiles, each perfect and without 
blemish, are tightly arranged along the floor of this spacious 
foyer. The walls are done in matching white marble, all of it 
polished to a mirror shine. Columns along the walls hold up the 
tall, arching ceiling; a golden sconce is set on each column to 
provide light at all hours. Tall windows let in the light, 
during the day, each shaft of light cutting across the air 
diagonally. Display cases full of archaic and masterworked 
weapons are set along the foyer for examination, with tapestries 
behind each case showing off the weapon in question during use.

Sages Fellowship Hall Foyer~
   A quiet atmosphere of gentle learning permeates this large 
foyer. Along the hall's sides grow green-leaved trees in a 
series of bronze pots that all depict different scenes. They are 
set on white tile that complements the white marble walls and the 
arching ceiling. Bright golden sconces are set into the walls at 
regular intervals to light the way, but tall rectangular windows 
let in the light at dramatic angles to paint the floor with 
sunlight during the day.

Healers Fellowship Hall Foyer~
   Pure white marble forms the floor and wall tiles of this 
expansive, simply-decorated foyer. Gold candelabras dangle from 
sturdy chains set in the arching ceiling, providing light for 
when the tall, rectangular windows aren't letting in enough 
sunlight. Various potted medicinal plants grow along the edges 
of the foyer, each set in a brass pot that displays various 
symbols of the fellowship. Decorative tapestries hang along the 
walls, each showing some famous scene from a battle in which a 
healer played a major part.

Horticulturists Fellowship Hall Foyer~
   Green growing things sprawl all across the white marble floor 
and walls of this large hall. Roses, lilies, and many flowers 
grow in their confining brass pots, always blooming no matter the 
season or weather. The windows here are larger than those in 
other halls, each one quite tall and wide and glazed in real 
glass, allowing the sunlight to touch and tickle almost every 
square inch of the hall during the daytime. At night, gold and 
silver candelabra that have metal ivy growing across their arms 
provide plenty of light.

Apothecarists Fellowship Hall Foyer~
   The air in this hall smells a bit sharp and musty as it flows 
through the white-marble floor and past the white walls. Windows 
let in sunlight during the day, and at night, ornate silver 
candelabra keep the area well-lit. Tapestries sewn with the 
tools of the apothecarist trade adorn the walls between each 
white fluted column, defining the edges of the room and thus 
providing a clear exit and entranceway.

An Expansive Bakery And Kitchen~
   This many ovens in such tight proximity would turn any smaller 
room into a furnace but this wide bank of stoves, ovens and 
baking surfaces would easily hold any two homes from the second 
circle. The ceiling is vaulted two stories and set with rows of 
chimneys to deal with the heat. The floors are polished wood 
with small, simple rugs set before each workspace to prevent 
spilled ingredients from becoming a hazard.

A Huge, Well Equipped Kitchen~
   Larger than many homes, this room is filled with stoves, 
ovens, shelves full of cooking materials, casks, giant bins and 
tubs, as well as several rows of counters. A small legion of 
cooks could make use of this room all at once without anyone 
rubbing shoulders. The floors are polished wood with simple, 
rough woven mats spaced anywhere one would be likely to spill 
anything. Banks of chimneys line the walls to carry out the 
smoke and heat while a series of windows and high-hung lanterns 
keep it well lit, day or night.

   The gleaming white stone of which this room is constructed is 
lit by a bank of windows along the wall, shaded in rich velvet 
curtains. From the ceiling, dozens of polished brass lanterns 
hang from twisted wrought iron chains, interspaced with banners 
represented various honors and awards given by Lords, Stewards 
and Kings long past in recognition of the Fellowships ancient 
history. The marbled floors are clothed in thick, ornately woven

A Well-Equipped Stonemasons Workshop~
   This room is gritty. No matter how much it is swepped, indeed 
if the roof were pulled back and all the heavens poured rain and 
wind upon it for days, one could likely still smell the dust and 
find its glittering grains settled in a thin coating on most 
surfaces. This room is a workshop for the managing of stone. 
The rafters hang with ropes and pullies, there are no less than 
six independent wenches and arms spaced about the room to allow 
the moving of blocks of stone that way several hundred pounds up 
onto the fortified workbenches, making them easier to manage. A 
marvel of engineering, one man can easily do the work of several 
with the aid of the tools in place here.

A Grand Stone Hall~
   No tapestries cover the walls here, no carpets obscure the 
floor, only the curtains of heavy velvet that shade the tall 
windows obscure any of this room. The fittings, the row of grand 
chandeliers that hang from the ceiling, all are gleaming polished 
steel and serve to cast light upon the masterworks of stone that 
make up the walls, floor and ceiling of this room. Each 
flagstone of the floor has been carved, worked into an image 
designed by one of the greatest Masters of the Fellowship. 
Several flagstones are as yet uncarved, each a promised chance at 
immortality to future Masters, the highest honor bestowed on a 
Fellow. The walls are set with grand columns, the ceiling worked 
ornately, the frames about the door and windows carved of marble 
such to befit the finest halls of an Lord. All of it set about a 
great stone table surounded by ornate stone chairs, a sense of 
immutable permanence about it all.

   The hallmark of this grand room is comfort. The soft velvet 
curtains which shade the windows are drawn on a counter-balance, 
needing little effort. The pulley system by which the elegant 
stained glass oil lamps are raised and lowered is a marvel of 
efficiency and simplicity. Thick carpets and tapestries clothe 
the stone walls and floor, keeping the cool and damp away while a 
series of small tables to the side of the great central meeting 
table hold little replicas and design models of everything from 
two-keyed locks to designs for windmills and siege weaponry.

objects of metal or wood onto the work- benches while hooded 
lanters, each set with a polished steel cover, sit over each 
spot, the opening adjustable as well as their hood and the

large polished white stones cobbling its surface and evenly

a granite statue of an eagle with its wings folded, a reminder of 
whence Rath Thoron got its name.

   Open and airy, this grand meeting hall has been worked to 
create a sense of being in the center of a woodland grove. Great 
trunks of trees have been split, creating half-columns that run 
up the sides while the arched supports for the ceiling are worked 
to look as the branches of great woody giants, holding the 
ceiling aloft. The wall spaces themselves are carved and painted 
in the image of a idyllic forest. Even the floor is covered in a 
thick green carpet, woven to look like the leaves, brush and 
plantlife one would expect to find in a secluded glen.

blocks of wood and lumber to be moved efficiently up onto 
workbenches while an impressive array of tools would allow one

A Clean, Wood-Scented Shop~
   This shopfront is laid out far more directly than the main 
foyer, the floor polished stone and walls covered in shelves and 
racks. Rows of tables fill the space between, all of it set with 
tools, lumber, nails, all the supplies needed for the shaping of 
wood into one use or another.

A Quiet, Well Appointed Meeting Hall~
   Grand tapestries hang from the walls, covering almost every 
inch of the white stone from which the building is actually 
built. Each of them depicting scenes of hunting and forest life. 
Deer running, men with bows draw, idyllic farm scenery of cows 
and sheep in their pastures. The ceilings are hung with fine 
wrought iron chandeliers, all etched in silver, while the 
fittings about the room for door and window seem to match. Even 
the cold stone floor has been covered over with a series of 
masterfully wrought rugs of thick wool, woven into images of 
crossed antlers and noble stags.

A Faintly Odorous Workshop~
   The malodorous scent of tanning clings to this room no matter 
how much it is cleaned. Several vents up high along the walls 
and a few hand-manned bellows along the side help keep a steady 
breeze through here, but the sheer volume of tanned and untanned 
hides that go through here have left their mark. Racks and 
shelves of tools, row after row of well equiped workspaces fill 
the workshop proper and large stretching racks are spaced about, 
enough for a dozen men to all work here at once without fouling 
one another.

A Metal-Smelling Great Hall~
   A magnificently outfitted hall with expansive sides and a
very high arching ceiling stretches forth here. Every inch of
marble wall is carved, and most of it's covered with huge
buntings and tapestries. The materials in here are fairly
common, though, with bronzeworked statues and huge worked
plaques covering the ceiling to reflect the light. Examples
of the masterworks of ages adorn the sides of the hall,
each grander than the last despite the materials.

An Efficient Workshop~
   A huge forge is the centerpiece to this large workroom. 
Around it are a number of sizable workbenches and tables. The 
forge is very old and of extremely good quality, as are the 
workbenches. This area is tiled in stone, but not marble, and 
the walls are pristine despite how much heat and smoke is 
generated here. Utilitarian in the extreme, this is a room where 
not only things get done, but a lot of things get done 
efficiently.

A Wide Metalsmithing Shopfront~
   Lots of shelves line the walls of this high-ceilinged shop. 
Made more like a warehouse than a retail establishment, it has a 
secure, settled feel to it, with its thick white walls with their 
bare windows and its well-fitted white tile floor that may not be 
mirror-shiny but is smooth and completely clean. The goods for 
sale have a distinctly industrial look, with bins and boxes on 
the shelves holding fittings, buttons, and lamp reservoirs. That 
said, the wall sconces and standing column lamps are exceedingly 
well-worked if practical, giving ample illumination to the aisles 
of goods for sale. 
   A plain, sturdy door stands to the west.

The Jewelers' Great Hall~
   This magnificent hall is long and wide, with a very high 
arching ceiling. Wonders dazzle the eye everywhere, from the 
magnificently carved columns with their jasmine plants twining 
around them, to the exquisite hanging candelabra with their 
thousands of faceted clear white quartz drops scattering the 
light. Shafts of light come in from the slanting windows during 
the day, but there's plenty of light at night, with the many 
gorgeous glass lamps and the candelabra. An elegantly worked 
woolen rug in shades of midnight blue and gold runs along the 
floor to the south end of the hall, which is open to allow for 
staged presentations when necessary. 
   A door set with golden plaques depicting scenes from Minas 
Tirith's past is set to the north.

An Elegantly-Appointed Shopfront~
   Pure white marble tiles polished to a mirror shine are tightly 
fit to form the floor of this large, pristine shop. A golden 
chandelier hangs from the center of the arched ceiling, showering 
scintillating light across glass display cabinets and storage 
shelves. Lamps are set behind some of the shelves to properly 
illuminate the sparkling wares set on each perfectly clean glass 
shelf. A thick rug is thrown across the middle of the floor, and 
opulent, thick drapes hang at the sides of the huge picture 
window set in one wall. 
   A pale wooden door chased in silver in flowing, runic-looking 
scrollwork stands to the west.

A Large Workroom Filled with Benches~
   This expansive room is large, with a stone floor. Though of 
pristine quality, the white granite tiles are more suited for 
actual work than for display. The white stone walls are 
perfectly clean despite the forge in the middle of the room. A 
very tall ceiling gives the already spacious room an even larger 
feel, and sunlight easily comes in through the tall rectangular 
windows all along the walls. Workbenches are arranged all around 
the forge, radiating out from it like the petals of a flower. 
   A heavy door banded in shiny silver is set to the east.

A stone fireplace is set in the northern wall to provide light

as well as a view of a backlot. They can be shut to provide some 
privacy and protection from the elements. A six-petalled flower,

to be used often for cooking.

stone floor and walls during the colder months of the year. 
Devoid of overt decoration or architectural embellishments, this

of shelving. The workroom extends to the west, where a large 
window allows some daylight into the room.

Atop An Arching Roof~
   The roof here is ancient and sagging, the wood traitorously 
groaning under any sudden or heavy weight. This roof was 
probably once well-shingled but now is topped with little more 
than a handful of the items, beneath the open sky of Minas 
Tirith. It is obvious to any with an eye that the building below 
is rotting and old, making this a precarious perch indeed. The 
building is crowned in a vaguely pyramid shape going from north 
to south, demanding any travels precariously hold their balance 
atop the arch.

Amongst the Rooftops of Southern Minas Tirith~
   Beneath the sky of Minas Tirith, this rather tall building is 
accessible via some planks hurriedly thrown over the gaps between 
the buildings surrounding it. The walk over them would be a 
rather dangerous maneuver indeed, as the boards hardly look new 
or even overly sturdy. The surrounding slum shanties and 
decaying buildings are somewhere in southern Minas Tirith. This 
particular roof houses what appears to be the remains of a 
chimney, one side of it broken away to reveal the inside of it 
and the other three walls, several bricks strategically missing 
inside it.

Inside a Tattered Living Room~
   The inside of this house is rather gloomy, cobwebs and dust 
being the foremost decorations. Motheaten blinds hang over 
boarded-over windows, the cloth and the wood doing a rather 
sufficient job of blocking most sunlight from entering this 
shack. Much of the wall around the chimney and the bricks 
themselves have been broken away, leaving a gaping hole in the 
wall. The walls are composed of low-quality wood that's rather 
rotten through as well, adding to the gloomy aura of this living 
room. The door itself is nailed closed with a variety of boards 
and bent nails. A dark doorway lays in the eastern wall.

Inside a Bare, Plain Room~
   Any colors this room once was have been faded into a dull gray 
from time and neglect. No furniture or other fixtures adorn this 
room, bare even of windows. The room itself is of moderate size 
for such impoverished surroundings, made of plain wood. The 
floor is bare, save for a carpet of dust, though quite a few 
footsteps put the lie to this building's rather abandoned aura.

Poised Atop Sagging Boards~
   Travel amongst the rooftops of southern Minas Tirith is a 
dangerous affair, and this particular area illuminates this 
reality. To progress between the buildings east and west of 
here, one is forced to walk atop some three ill-conceived planks 
thrown over the span. They look rather roughly weathered and 
putting nigh any weight atop them causes them to creak and bemoan 
their seemingly imminent shattering. Any travelers here are 
exposed to the vicious elements, including hard winds and 
whipping rains. The eastern planks, rather than terminating at 
another roof, seem to lead into a rather large window.

Attic of a Shanty-House~
   Access into this lofty attic is granted via two ways--a series 
of planks resting on the sill of a large window leading 
westwards, or a rather dusty staircase which leads down 
presumably into the rest of the house. The attic itself is, for 
the most part, empty save for the odd bits of rubbish--some 
broken pieces of wood, a few scattered bits of iron metal, and 
some torn bits of cloth. The roof sags beneath the weight of its 
years and, in several places, leaks heavily when it rains.

Atop Shattered Stairs~
   The stairs leading down from the attic have shattered, 
weakened from what seems to have been ages of slow weakening and 
rot. The wreckage of the stairs can be seen some ten or fifteen 
feet below--not over far to jump, if one's willing for a bit of 
pain. The downfall of these shattered stairs is that it denies 
access to either of the hallways leading east and west from this 
particular nexus. The ground floor lies below, this being the 
second story of the old house.

Entrance of a Squalid Home~
   The prevalent color of this rather large house is a bland, 
dreary gray. Any color the walls were once painted has been 
leeched away by time and ill use, though a series of muddy shoe- 
and bootprints pass thickly towards the western way. To the east 
lays what seems to be an ancient kitchen, while above is the 
broken, twisted remains of a staircase. It ends perhaps ten or 
fifteen feet above ground level, bits of wood protruding like 
tusks from the ruin.

A Squalid Kitchen~
   While lacking pots, pans, or really cooking utensils of any 
kind, this room nevertheless has all of the built-in shelves and 
ledges that would mark it as the house's kitchen. The area is 
dusty, and looks almost completely untouched. The floorboards 
are straight and even, save for a hole caused by some 
long-forgotten incident, the edges of the hole in the floor 
jagged and perhaps the size of a fist.

A Dismal Sleeping Area~
   This room, of rather large proporitions, seems to have 
dissolved into the sleeping area of a gang of bums and beggars. 
The floor is thick with sleeping mats, mostly dirtied with filth 
and ridden with fleas and worse bugs. During the day, the room 
is mostly empty while at night it fills up with sleeping, snoring 
forms and the area is permeated with the smell of unwashed bodies 
and old sweat.

A Low-Lit Gambling Den~
   This room seems to be of newer quality than the rest of the 
inn, the walls and floor made of wooden planks, clean and left 
their natural, light-brown color. Glass sconces have been fitted 
rather lowly upon the walls within alcoves so as to provide light 
but just enough so that it is a soft and hushed atmosphere. A 
few tables and chairs have been arranged here, patrons gracing 
their seats from time to time as they chat softly with one 
another in this hushed gambling den. The only exit to this room 
is the open archway to the west that leads back into the common 
room.

and hangings of pure white and silver silk high up on the white- 
panelled walls. The floor is glossy white marble tiles, all

walls are set with symbols of Minas Tirith, Gondor, and the 
Steward, as well as the Healer's Fellowship itself. A front 
section of the room is empty, for ceremonies, and through the 
rest of the room, straight columns hold up the roof at regular

in golden sconces.

A Large Reference Library~
   This spacious library is perfectly clean, its pristine environs
scented lightly of lilac. Bookcases are set all around its edges, with
other references in the room's middle on shorter bookcases and shelving
units. Diagrams of the human body, examples of various healing tools
and ointments, and other useful things to the study of healing are
here, arranged so that they may be studied in comfort. Tapestries on
the walls depict healers at work in battle situations.
   A door is set to the west.

The Golden Grain Bakery~
   This spacious shopfront is the lower level of a large stone 
building. Its floor inside is made of tightly-fitted pale tiles, 
with no carpet or rugs. The cream-painted panelled walls lead up 
to a high ceiling. Aisles of baked goods are set along the edges 
of the shop, with a main counter against the east wall where 
purchases may be made. People seem to be here at all hours, 
though at night the crowd is minimal. The air smells always of 
fresh bread.

A Large Supply Greenhouse~
   This large glass greenhouse has numerous panes of real glass, 
all faintly tinted green, set into a metal frame. It's always 
just a little warm here, even in winter, but in the summer it can 
get unbearably hot. A counter near the door sells goods 
horticulturists need, but it'd be almost impossible to just go 
find most of these things. There are simply too many thick, 
bushy plants to sift through, even with the labels and vaguely 
organized pots. 
   A rose-carved door stands to the south.

An Experimental Greenhouse~
   This glass-walled greenhouse is enormous, with its large panes 
of clear, if slightly greenish, glass set in a metal frame. It's 
always a little warm in here, no matter the weather, and if it's 
summer, then inside it is actually uncomfortably sweltering. 
There are plants everywhere, scenting the air, and it's quite 
humid with them. A wide central aisle leads to workspaces set 
along the walls of the greenhouse. Plants grow here, numerous 
projects belonging to the fellowship's members, in large racks 
and shelves that allow them access to the sunlight.

The Horticulturists Fellowship Great-Hall~
   This large hall is spacious and smells of flowers. The first 
thing most visitors notice when entering the hall, after the 
scent, is the fluted columns set along the walls leading toward 
the front of the room. Each column is twined about with a 
different flowering ivy-like plant that curls around it from 
golden pots set on the floor, all the way up to the ceiling. 
Roses, jasmine, honeysuckle, and more bloom here, giving the hall 
a living presence others lack. At the front of the hall are more 
pots of flowering plants, all rare and all perfectly groomed. A 
high ceiling is set with skylights and three candelabra that all 
drip pale pink faceted quartz drops. 
   A door carved with exotic orchids is set to the north.

An Apothecary Supply Shop~
   This intricately-spicy-smelling shop is large, but it still 
seems cramped due to the many aisles and bins with goods for 
sale. The air tickles most people's noses, a strange mixture of 
odd herbs and spices both sweet and savory. The floor and walls 
are perfectly clean even around the silver and gold-chased wall 
sconces that hold ornate lamps. A window lets in the light 
during the day, shining to one side of the counter where sales 
are made. There are so many things for sale that most people 
could explore here for hours and still not know everything in the 
inventory.

The Apothecarist's Fellowship Great Hall~
   This large hall is longer than it is wide, and dazzles the eye 
with its shades of white and pale-gold. Golden bunting adorns 
the walls near the high ceiling, sweeping dramatically toward the 
front of the chamber. Tall, doric-style columns stand along the 
hall at regular intervals, each one hung with silver and gold 
chains that hold up silver-sconced lamps. The columns stop short 
of the front of the hall as well, giving the appearance of a 
public ceremony place. The floor is pure white tiles, and the 
walls are panelled with pale oak rubbed white. The feel is 
stately and elegant, and it always seems a little hushed in here. 
   A set of double doors stands to the south.

A Large Workshop~
   This spacious, square-shaped room smells sharp and pungent, 
though it is perfectly clean. Workbenches, each wide and deep, 
give plenty of room for anybody to study or prepare goods. There 
are many of them, all set with more than enough room between for 
free movement. A wall hanging of popular herbs and ingredients, 
as well as some other references, hangs on one entire wall, with 
enough room that someone could easily study them. There's plenty 
of light to work by, as well, with two windows that let in the 
light and fresh air, and at night many wall lamps. Each 
workbench, as well, has a bright little lamp on it that 
illuminates anything vibrantly.

Small Stone Hovel~
   This small dwelling is situated at the edge of a garden. The 
ceiling is low, the slanted wooden planks coming down from a 
comfortable height at the northern end of the hovel to just 
barely above shoulder level in the south. The walls are built of 
heavy, roughly-hewn, grey stones tightly formed together, and 
cemented with a dirt-colored substance. To the west, a narrow 
door opens outside. Two small diamond-shaped windows covered 
with curtains mirror each other on either side of the door.

   Small, cozy and dry, this is a very small pantry hidden behind 
a thick rough linen curtain. The pantry is lower than the rest 
of the house, and anyone entering the room needs to take a 
significant step down onto earthen floor. Nevertheless, the roof 
slopes down on this side of the house, preventing most average

comfortably stretch their arms, and there is enough room to take 
a couple steps in each direction towards the white stone walls.

   The large workroom is very spacious, but quite simple and 
utilitarian. The walls are white, and are built of old, worn 
stone. Along much of the entire western wall, a large arched 
window gazes onto the street below. A heavy stone sill stretches 
out beneath the window, covered in scratches and small fissures. 
Large, worn, shutters, built of heavy planks, provide a measure 
of privacy to the room.

being that which are needed for what it was obviously built for. 
Shelves line the beige-painted walls, covered in tools of various 
types while a large, expansive worktable dominates the area as it 
stands in the middle of the room. A small stove has been tucked 
into the corner of the room, a cast-iron pipe leading upwards and 
out through the ceiling to lead the smoke away from the room. 
The only exit is eastwards, through the door back to the private 
wing.

In a Well-Organized Cellar~
   Spacious but dimly lit, this cellar has been carefully 
organized, with each item in its proper place. Shelves line
the walls, and large crates and barrels have been placed
beneath them. A sturdy staircase leads upwards to a heavy
wooden trapdoor, the keyhole glinting in even the faintest
of light. The seemingly recently placed floorboards are 
thick and smoothly sanded.

A Cozy Room Selling Art Supplies~
   This cozy room is fashioned of ancient, white stone, the large 
blocks of granite composing the high walls bright and 
well-maintained. The grey-veined, marble floor maintains its 
shine despite the obvious wear with use. A few people linger 
about the area, browsing the various artistic utensils, canvas, 
and paints for sale. Small, arched windows allow streams of 
light to slip into the room during the day, providing it with 
good illumination.

handdug and rough. The ground is hard-packed and flat, but a

tunnels continues on eastwards, uninterrupted.

contrasts sharply with the white granite blocks of the floor and 
oval-shaped walls. Bookshelves cover just about every inch of
this walk-in closet-sized room, with plenty of storage space.
It always seems cooler than the rest of the library, and much

   Being inside this cage has to have a disorienting effect on 
almost any occupant. It sways from below, often being pushed by 
something unseen. The floor is composed of thick iron, dirtied 
and slick with bodily substances of various sorts. Below, there 
seems to be a ring of lanterns which cast strange, clarity- 
ravaging shadows upon any within as it sifts through the thick 
bars of the cage. The stench from the floor would be 
overpowering to any but the strongest, access into the cage 
granted only via a massive trap door in its bottom.

the boxes in rows suited to their contents. The vast majority of 
them seem to be kinds of exotic imports, were one to look inside

backroom to give it at least the illusion of some spartan 
comfort.

The Iron Blades of Minas Tirith~
   Spartan yet well-appointed, this shop seems able to cater to 
every need regarding weapons for the patrons of the second 
circle. The floor has been recently restored with solid planks 
of darkly varnished wood, and the walls are made of stone and 
whitewashed. Several rows of shelves and racks have been firmly 
affixed to the walls and display a large collection of implements 
of combat, as well as ammunitions for bows and crossbows. A 
long, wide counter permits the display of a specific piece by the 
shops staff. The smell of metal and oil permeates the room as 
all the goods sold seem to be in pristine condition and set so 
they glint with the light coming either from a window to the west 
or from the lamps on the walls. One can leave the shop through a 
strong door made of oak to the west or into a backroom to the 
east.

A Quaint Bedroom~
   High, cold-white-stone walls lead to a bleak, marbled ceiling, 
setting curious tone to this small, spartan bedroom. Bleak but 
fine, it is dotted sparsely with furniture and dominated by a 
large stone fireplace. The western door is framed in delicate 
stonework, and the filigree runs between the tiles in detailed 
silver. Plain lanterns mount the windowless walls, capable of 
lighting the entirety of the room as dimly or brightly as 
desired.

hundreds of people endlessly traversing the uncracked, flawless 
white cobblestones on their way to and from. Shops line the 
edges of the plaza and numerous stalls and stands have been set 
up here and there, all brightly-colored, adding to the haphazard 
atmosphere. A small staircase attached to the northern building 
leads up to the second floor. 
   A mulberry-trimmed stall has been set up here, colorful 
ribbons wrapped around the two poles which support its shingled 
roof.

horse hooves on the solid white cobblestones and merchant wagons

The Grain Market Buyers at the Southern End of the Plaza~
   Space is at a premium in this part of the market. Bushels of 
cereals and sacks of flour are stacked down on to pallet boards, 
sometimes to twice the height of a man. The wares are bought and 
sold by the bushel or sack by farmers and merchants and bakers 
and sold by the cupful to common people and servants of rich 
prices at the top of their voices to attract customers. The 
competition is fierce, the market traders bellow their prices at 
the top of their voices to attract customers. 
   To the northwest through the stalls, one can spot the high 
arch of the white fountain that dominates the center of the 
Plaza.

The Herb Market Buyers at the Southwestern End of the Plaza~
   Quiet and almost serene in contrast to the rest of the great 
market the herbalist's display their wares. Small stalls, booths 
and barrows are piled high with jars, pots and bags full of dry 
and fresh herbs. Potted plants and bundles of larger herbs often 
sit in front of the marketeers displays giving the whole place a 
rather unkempt and cluttered appearance while a cacophany of 
aromatic and pungent scents mingle in the air. 
   To the south, grand oak doors lead into the Sun Plaza Events 
Hall and Ballrooms.

pulled by a leather harness that at one time was attached to a 
beast. Inside the bed of this wagon are numerous bags of flour 
and other such bakery products, a road-side store running from 
out of the abandoned dray.

Minas Tirith Council Branch Office~
   This stone chamber is rather spacious, allowing for a large 
number of people to occupy it at once. Wide, stained-glass 
windows are set in the wall to the north, allowing the light to 
filter in through the day to fill the room with a myriad of 
colors. Bright tapestries adorn the walls, protraying scenes of 
soldiers and past Kings of Gondor. The tower before a seven- 
pointed star symbol of the Minas Tirith City Council has been 
painted across the high stone ceiling repeatedly. 
   The aides and clerks of the city council bustle in and out of 
the large room, sometimes heading through the doors in the back 
of the hall to carry out their duties.

A Small, Well-Tended Courtyard~
   This small, open courtyard is well-tended, the plethora of 
flowers and herbs that grow in the small gardens vibrant in color 
and lending this area a comfortable and cheerful atmosphere. The 
cobblestones of the court are a random arrangement of light grey 
stones and dark red ones, coloring the paths that lead north, 
south, and west to the freshly-painted doors of private homes. 
To the east, the path continues beneath a small, overhead pass to 
the lobby beyond. 
   A few brass lanterns hang upon poles here and there, 
perpetually lighting the area. Illuminated at all times are
three tally marks on the north door, four tally marks on the
west door and five tally marks on the southern door.

A Modest, Green-Painted Room~
   This modestly-sized apartment room is large enough to hold a 
few basic furniture pieces though and is simple, but elegant in 
style. The walls are freshly-painted a soft, sage green and a 
simple molding in an eggshell white color runs across the tops 
and bottoms of the walls. There are two windows set into the 
southern wall, looking out into the courtyard that allow fresh 
air and daylight to filter in. 
   A door to the south leads out into the compound courtyard and 
a small, sturdy door to the west leads into the bedroom.

Between a Courtyard and Foyer~
   Beneath the second story of the apartment complex this path 
passes past private homes to the north and to the south, their

way westwards where a small courtyard can be seen and along the 
building walls, a few bronze sconces have been hung, perpetually 
casting a soft lighting to the area. 
   One tally mark has been carved onto the northern door, with

   Spacious and grand, this foyer is well-appointed and tastefully 
furnished, tapestries lining the walls, older yet still carrying 
their vibrant colors as they are well-cared for. The room itself 
is made of white stones expertly fitted together so that the 
floor and walls are smooth to the touch, only the barest of 
grooves felt under one's fingers. Across the entire floor, an 
ornamental, woven rug is spread, lending more to the grandeur 
here. A half-curved stairway, wide and with a darkly-stained 
banister spirals up to the second floor while set in the wall to 
the south is a stone archway leading into a hallway further into

A Mahogany-Panelled, Well-Lit Hallway~
   The stone construction of this building is concealed by a 
layer of richly-stained, mahogany panelling, a combination that 
keeps the area warm in the winter and cool in the summer. A 
colorful, ornamental carpet runs the length of the hallway, 
slightly-worn but still beautiful in its ancient elegance and the 
passage is well-lit by glass sconces mounted upon both walls at 
intervals. An open archway leads west into what can be seen of 
the dining room while the rest of the hallway continues further 
south, another branch leading east through the manor.

panelling that covers the white-stone of the house on its walls. 
Yet another, long carpet runs across the length here, its color 
illuminating the length of the hallway by way of the pleasant 
lighting that shines from the glass sconces intermittently hung 
upon the walls here, perpetually lighting the way.

Before A Small Stables~
   The grey, flagstone path continues here, wide enough for 
mounts of carriages to traverse as the path leads up to the front 
of a small, well-constructed stables. Surrounding the stables 
are well-tended garden plants of dog-rose bushes and other lush 
vegetation. The path branches off southwards around the corner 
of the manor where a small, side garden can be spotted in the 
distance

   The grey flagstones of the path wend their way in a wavering 
path around the corner of the manor north and south just outside. 
To either side of the path are well-tended trees and flowering 
bushes, here and there set upon the ground a granite pillar upon 
which sits a bronze-and-glass lamp to illuminate the pathway in 
the evening. To the north upon the path, one can see the stables 
while south, it leads to a small, side garden.

adding not only an elegant but definite masculine touch to the 
household. This landing is sparsely-furnished, only a side table 
against the wall and a glass sconce perpetually illuminating the 
top of the stairwell. There are two doors here, both made of 
wood and in the sliding fashion east into a private sitting room 
and south into the master's bedroom.

A Rectangular, Vaulted Dining Room~
   This room is faintly narrow as it is rectangular in shape 
though its high, vaulted ceiling lends it a large and spacious 
air. As the rounded vaults above near the flattened side of the 
walls, it changes from the elegant, white stone to the 
richly-stained mahogany panels as the outer hallway, continuing 
down to the ground where it meets white-stone again in 
simply-carved molding that only enhances the natural beauty of 
the wood grain. A long, oaken table sits perfectly center in the 
middle of the room and behind it, set in the western wall is a 
lavish, stained-glass door depicting a scene of roses and lilies 
in full bloom. 
   To the south, tucked in the far corner of the room is a narrow 
wooden door and the only other exit is east, back into the 
hallway.

delicately-wrought in a spiraling style to fence around the lush 
garden and flagstone path. The path here ends in a small circle 
of flagstones providing an area of respite, a large tree lending 
shade to those who would sit at the circular, marble garden bench 
strategically placed beneath. Other lush and healthy plants lend 
a vibrant and cheerful atmosphere here, everything well-tended.

   This spacious kitchen is made of well-cut, bright white stone 
as the rest of the house to prevent the spread of accidental 
fire, not a hint of soot staining the immaculate walls or 
flooring here. There is ample room for the large, cooking 
equipment that the manor needs, a pearly-white stove set against 
the wall with a stone funnel leading up from it to dispense the 
heat throughout the home and keep the manor warm. Along the 
opposite wall, a lage hearth has been set, ample enough in size 
for both warmth and to cook. A small, narrow door in the north 
leads one straight into the dining room while another, 
regular-sized door leads east into the hallway.

perfectly to form this modest bedroom. The stones keep the room 
cool in the summer months while a small fireplace set in the 
eastern wall keeps the room warm in the winter, the metal piping 
of the fireplace concealed by the stones of the wall to disperse

step inside the quiet, respectful, Hall of Remembrance. The area 
is almost completely silent, despite the fact that it remains

their presence maintaining a respectful silence amongst the other 
comers and goers. Large pillars support this mostly-open foyer, 
the roof over head sturdy and grandoise. In the white marble, 
carved in masterful fashion, the White Tree of Gondor and its 
Stars are boldly placed over the entrance. In the middle of this 
large stone entryway, a podium rises, facing outwards towards the 
path rather than inwards towards the building.

of the black and white swirled marble floor. Few decorations or 
comforts are offered within the four walls, as the chairs and

marble. Along the northern, southern and western walls are 
benches of a similar sort of stone, providing limited seating for 
observers. The doors looming to the east are of a heavy wood, 
solid and sturdy in appearance and usually closely guarded, as

boundaries of it. Carvings and statues are set all over, 
carefully arranged, of war heroes and those memorials skillfully 
crafted. Within, the mood is a somber one, the voices of most 
who pass through and linger hushed and grim. Those few who speak 
above the low tones are immediately hushed by those nearby. The 
doors that lead out are of a rich mahogany, intricately carved 
with the White Tree of Gondor in the patterns there.

floor, red to contrast with the fading purple paint on the walls. 
There isn't much of the walls visible, though, for all the drapes 
and cheap painted cloths on display. The air smells of incense 
and of soap, but the area is clean at least. There are no 
windows visible at all ever, so lamps provide all the light, an 
odd effect during the daytime. A staircase leads up into the 
rest of the place, and painted doors lead to other areas in the 
building. A trapdoor leads downward, but the trapdoor stays 
closed and is off to the side where nobody can step on it or 
trip.

   This spartan office is square-shaped, with no windows. Purely
functional, with utilitarian bronze lamps for light, it is very clean
and arranged sensibly, with enough room for several people to work
if necessary.
   A single door leads west.

A Small, Enclosed Room~
   This small stone room is absolutely clean, without a speck of 
dust or spiderwebs visible. It has a high ceiling but no 
windows. A barred door to the west lets in light at all hours 
though, and during the day, the sounds of people exercising is 
clearly audible though not disturbing enough to bother most 
sleepers. The wooden floor is tightly fitted and glued down, and 
there are no light fixtures.

A Cluttered, Multicolor Costume and Instrument Shop~
   The walls and ceiling of this shop have been garishly-painted 
a bright gold in color. From every corner of the room, curtains, 
draperies, and tapestries with bawdy scenes embroidered upon them 
have been hung, adding a splash of color here and there to create 
a rather hectic and haphazard feel to the shop. There are bins 
full of masks and other gadgets while upon racks and shelves, any 
manner of costume apparel has been set out. Arrayed along one 
wall are an assortment of instruments. A long, checkered counter 
extends from the back wall while behind it is a crimson-painted 
door, flanked by some of the finer instruments.

A Row of Houses Upon a Side Street~
   The side street here is quite narrow as it continues through 
the alabaster city of Minas Tirith. As the street continues, 
less shops are seen and it becomes purely houses. Traffic is not 
as busy here as the presence of merchants, peddlers, and other 
hawkers are devoid, only a few citizens passing through. The 
white cobblestones continue here east and west along the street. 
A bell beside each door allows those passing to ring north or 
ring south to alert those within of the presence of someone 
outside.

A Comfortable Living Room~
   The broad expanse of this modest living room allows for a 
large group of people to gather in relative comfort. The floor 
is of stripped hardwood, well-kept and recently varnished, atop 
which rests a wooly rug of hunter green. Several furnishings are 
scattered throughout the room and a large window is set in the 
eastern wall, adjacent to another to allow ample lighting to 
filter in during the daytime. A wide, oaken door stained a deep 
umber is set in the southern wall and opposite, to the north, a 
smaller yet sturdy door leads into the office. An open archway 
to the east leads into the kitchen.

   This hallway is short and quite narrow, left plain and 
unadorned save for a beige carpet runner that extends the length 
of the hall and a lantern hanging on a hook in the wall at the 
top of the stairs to illuminate the area. There are three doors 
here leading into private chambers to the north, east, and west.

A Spacious Bedroom~
   This bedroom can be easily named as one of the largest rooms 
of the house, enough space for a few large pieces of furniture to 
be easily fit. In the northern wall, a large fireplace has been 
set, following the chimney from the fireplace directly below on 
the first floor and providing warmth to the room. The walls have 
been freshly painted a light beige in color and the molding a 
soft, eggshell, creating warmth and making the walls seem taller 
than they are. 
   A door set in the southern wall leads out into the hallway.

A Comfortable Living Room~
   This living room is modest in size though large enough for an 
ample amount of people to gather in relative comfort. The floor 
is made of wooden planks sanded smooth though slightly worn from 
time, atop which rests a pale yellow rug. A sturdy door is set 
in the northern wall, leading back out to the street with a large 
window set beside it to alow light to filter in during the 
daytime. To the south, a smaller door leads into a private 
bedchamber while through an open archway to the east, a kitchen 
can be seen.

Ye Olde Forge~
   This large shopfront has been sturdily and skillfully made of 
light grey flagstones from the ceiling to the floor. Though the 
smell of burnished metal and cleaning oil wafts in the air, this 
shop is well-appointed and functional, display cases and sturdy 
shelves lining the walls with polished armaments set for sale. 
Numerous types of shields and body armor are hung upon the walls 
for display while heraldic designs have been painted in vibrant 
colours for decoration. 
   A door to the north behind the counter leads further into the 
shop while southern door back out to the plaza. To the east, the 
shop continues to where the specialty armor is sold.

A Modest, Tastefully-Decorated Sitting Room~
   Leading directly from the shopfront to the south is this 
sitting room made of stone, just like the rest of the building. 
Though modest in size, it is tastefully-decorated, a set of 
comfortable chairs arranged around the room with a cozy, crimson 
rug spread in the middle of them. Much of the room's 
illumination is provided by several, well-placed sconces on the 
walls and warmth drifts in through the curtained archway to the 
north that leads to the kitchen. To the west, a sturdy door has 
been set leading into the workroom while to the east, a narrow 
hallway branches.

An Expansive, Well-Organized Workroom~
   As with the rest of the shop, the walls and floor here are 
made of light-grey flagstones to prevent fire from spreading in 
case of an accident. Armor in various stages of completion hang 
from the walls as well as many tools and pieces of equipment. A 
sturdy shelf dominates most of one wall, filled with supplies and 
other crates while a set of cabinets have been set against 
another. To the west and south, small doors are set, leading 
into two separate storerooms while a large, iron ring has been 
attached to the trapdoor leading down into the cellar.

A Stone-Walled Storage Cellar~
   This cellar is made of light grey flagstones perfectly-fitted 
together to keep this underground room cool, even in the summer 
months. Heavy, oaken beams support the roof, also of stone and 
the entire room itself is large enough to store quite a bit of 
equipment or supplies.

along the length of the hallway while a few, well-placed glass 
sconces have been hung upon the walls to provide ample lighting. 
Upon the northern wall, a large, well-made kite shield has been 
hung and to the east and south, doors have been set, leading to 
the dormitory and a private chamber.

   A floor of light grey stones continues here like the rest of 
the room, keeping the room cool in the summer months and also 
warm in the cooler months. The spacious enclosure is bedecked 
with cabinetry, shelving and piping for heat, proffering ease of 
use and plenty of storage. A single rectangular window in the 
northern wall offers light to filter in during the daytime, the 
pane bound in a frame of hammered brass. To the west, a 
glass-paned door leads out into the forge and garden while a 
curtained archway separates this room from the sitting room to

A Sheltered Forge and Yard~
   A stone patio on the back of the shop in the First Circle is 
used as a forge. Covered with a slanted, shingled roof, a work 
area set with a massive forge is sheltered from the elements. 
The forge itself has a tall chimney of bricks that allows the 
smoke to filter up and out of the yard, set against the high, 
stone walls that surround the garden from the rest of the city. 
The rest of the yard not covered in stone grows healthy, green 
grass and a few well-tended flowers and blossoming bushes grow 
along the perimeter.

   This spacious, stone room plays host to a number of small 
beds, which line the eastern and southern walls, each of which 
has a small, trunk placed at their foot. Set along the western 
wall is a series of shelves, placed very near a round table and 
chairs. The floor has been left bare as are the walls which are 
devoid of any treatment whatsoever though the window in the 
eastern wall is curtained by an ivory, linen curtain. Set in the 
northern wall, near the middle of the room, is a heavy door of 
lightly-stained oak.

while an armoire is set in the far corner, a large, oaken bed 
placed not far from it. A glass-paned window set in the eastern 
wall allows light to filter in during the daytime though a 
strategically-placed glass sconce has been hung upon the walls to 
illuminate the room in the daytime. In the western wall, a 
doorway has been set leading out into the hallway.

Solmund's Specialties~
   The light grey flagstones of the shop continue eastwards here 
into far end of the shop where specialty armors are sold. Less 
armaments decorate the walls and have been set for display, most 
kept behind a long, wooden counter. The armor that can be seen 
are obviously of better quality and of rarer type, even some not 
usually seen in other armor shops. A stand behind the counter 
displays a set of shiny, horse barding and upon the far eastern 
wall, the large image of a black anvil and blacksmith's hammer 
has been painted.

unmarred and finely grained, passing the distinction of finery 
and wealth. Several windows are set in the walls, dark blue 
curtains hanging around the glass. A long counter stretches 
along the western way, a sturdy door set behind it.

window are a dark blue, and the walls a paler version of the same 
hue. On the floor is a green rug atop plain wood planks. Large 
enough to hold a good number of people, sparse furniture makes 
the room seem almost empty. To the east is an archway that leads 
into the kitchen, and to the north, south, and west, doors bar 
the way.

Within an Expansive Domed Hall~
   From the southern hallway several branches of green stone 
crawl out and feebly snake over the wall. Their reach dwindles 
rapidly underneath the colossal size of the area into which they 
are allowed but a small peek. The great hall itself, at very 
first glance, is left almost untouched of decoration in its 
architecture, with pillars of white marble mottled with green 
veins spanning past several stories and arching out to create 
ingenious weight-bearing platforms that neatly extend into the 
walls. A closer look would reveal that with masterfully crafted 
design, the theme of woodland is not yet lost. Those very 
pillars, as they evolve into support beams that hold aloft the 
great chambers ceiling have been eloquently carved to resemble 
the trunks of trees, all of the branches coming together into a 
knotted mesh right at the center point of the hall. It's there 
that the stone vanishes suddenly, worked away to make room for a 
glass pane that lets light play out in fractal patterns upon 
those who pass so far below. The floor is a clean, snowy white 
and easily gives off reflections as it's kept well maintained and 
clean. To the vast outskirts of the hall, several staircases 
curl up to lead to various upper levels.

The rythmatic sound of rainwater hitting the the building
creates a constant lull to the interior, the liquid creating patterns
where its visible upon the thick glass panels set within the vaulted,
domed ceiling. Long-stemmed, intricately-designed braziers placed evenly 
throughout the room provide a gentle source of yellow light to the 
surroundings during the gloom given by the overcast clouds, 
casting long shadows whenever someone passes by. 
The  walls are made of ancient white stone, veins of darker grey 
creeping over its surface. Upon the strong, timeworn walls are a 
large number of framed paintings, some consuming great areas with 
their colours, challenging those smaller in shapes. Maps and 
tapestries depicting faded images, lending to the aged 
atmosphere of the area. A small hallway leads from the area.

A Spacious Common Room~
This room is made of old granite like the rest of the building 
but uniquely yet in an elegant manner, the walls are panelled in 
a rich, mahogany wood. There are no windows to allow a breeze 
in, instead, all the walls are lined from ceiling to floor in 
oaken bookshelves. A few desks and comfortable chairs are placed 
here and there, though most of the furniture is ancient. 
West leads into the workroom while south goes to the 
dormitory. A winding staircase leads to the upper levels of the 
building, sealed by a large oaken door, while the door at the far 
corner of the room leads down into the main sanctuary.

   Sparse of furnishings, and bereft of much comfort, this cell 
offers little by the way of basic considerations in a room. Only 
a cold, clean floor, and hard, uncomfortable cots for beds 
against the walls provide even the smallest amount of comfort. 
The only window of sorts is set in the door, and the air is

A Trashy Intersection Within a Delapidated House~
   The boards creak beneath any trespassers within this old 
house, and the wind moves through the rotted walls, causing a 
near-constant whistling and groaning to be heard as the old 
supports are strained. Any present now would seem to be far from 
the first to transgress the house, as trash and flea-infested old 
pallets lay haphazardly about. The house is set up in more of a 
sprawling fashion than anything purposeful, branches leading off 
both east and north.

Climbing Over Collapsed Wood~
   While the stairs continue downwards, they halt very abruptly 
going upwards. Whatever second story was once built here, the 
shoddy building materials and the lack of upkeep has finally 
wreaked havoc on the structure--nigh all of it has collapsed into 
a useless heap, almost blocking the stairs from passage. The 
house, once with a vaguely pyramidcal top, is now bluntly square. 
The neighboring structure, however, is only some four feet away.

A Nakedly Bare Room~
   From the stains and marks upon the floor, it seems that 
furniture used to stand here, but has long since then been 
removed. Instead, the floor is almost bare, save a few, 
strangely new seeming, crates that are scattered about, all 
empty. The floorboards here are aged and creaking, several 
broken through to reveal the dirt of the ground beneath. All in 
all, it seems to be a rather despondent area with a sort of 
abandoned feel to it, with the crates and their open lids and the 
glaring emptiness of the room. The only thing that really lends 
this room any hint of character is the rather delipidated 
stairwell leading upwards.

Amongst Shattered Furniture~
   Apparently the target of someone's rage sometime in the past, 
all of the furniture in this area seems to have been shattered 
some time ago. Wooden splinters are all that remains of what 
was, once, perhaps a table and chairs, and the rough skeleton of 
a couch can be seen, its cushions torn apart and its frame 
beaten. The walls, once white-painted, are a ragtag of colors 
now, stained from sources that are probably best left unsaid, as 
the faint remnants of a horrid smell still remain.

Scrambling Across a Rooftop~
   The roof of this building has been, to put it gently, 
well-weathered. It forms a pyramidical shape that is rather 
steep on either side, making travel across it, especially 
expediant travel, a tricky affair. Moss has begun to grow atop 
the shingles, and those that are stepped upon are often times 
loose, sending a flight of them skittering from the building and 
to crash down onto the street far below. While other building 
are relatively close by, none moreso than the one to the south, 
though it to forces a precarious leap.

   This, once pyramidical, rooftop is already beginning to sag 
from its own weight, the rotting wood slowly crumbling into 
nothing. The wood is fragile and anyone foolish enough to set 
foot upon this area would soon find their foot crashing through 
into the building below. This area, to any with sense, would be 
considered as dangerous to travel across in the extreme.

it. The dust would be choking to any freshly initiated to it, 
not to mention the blatant danger of the wood falling on them, or 
them falling atop it. Despite having no windows, along the 
southern way there lies a rather crooked door.

   At first glance, this room seems to be, while of good 
construction, rather spartanly furnished. Lanterns are mounted 
on each wall and, oddly enough, all of the furniture seems to be 
either nailed or bolted solidly to the floor, save the chairs of 
the table. The room itself sways, nigh constantly, up and down, 
marking its presence as that of a room on a boat or large ship. 
The sounds that come from the eastern door are those of almost 
any sea-going vessel: seagulls, the sound of flapping canvas, and 
the call of sailors.

The Minas Tirith Clans~
   From here you can reach all the different Minas Tirith clan 
rooms. In this room, we tell you about Minas Tirith - its laws, 
customs and important people. 
   Minas Tirith lies within the Pelennor Fields nearby the River 
Anduin. It is surrounded by the Rammas Echor - a grand wall of 
incredible proportions that sweeps through the Pelennor Fields in 
a massive arc, offering a good deal of protection from the ever 
present threat of Mordor to the east. Minas Tirith is home to a 
large number of wealthy merchants and craftsmen, as well as a 
widespread network of watchmen - the Minas Tirith Guard. 
Furthermore, the city boasts a collection of influential Fellows 
and Councilors, whose wealth and connections have shaped the 
general management and development of the city since its 
inception. Most of Gondor's lordly Houses also have a presence 
in the City, usually in the higher, restricted tiers of the 
capital. 
   Popular Inns and taverns in Minas Tirith surrounding this Hall 
include "The Gilded Lily" (#3LOOK LILY#0) - for the higher class 
of patron and "The Battered Shield" (#3LOOK BATTERED#0) - for 
soldiers and the everyday citizens of Minas Tirith.

The Fellowships of Minas Tirith~
   This room is filled with the great and good of the Fellowships 
of Minas Tirith. The Fellowship (of guilds) came about through 
the uniting of artisans and merchants for mutual benefit. Where 
there had been many separate guilds for a single craft, a single 
group of fifteen Fellowship was established many thousands of 
years ago and established itself as a powerful source of aid and 
economic power for its guilds and guild members. Each guild 
(often simply called a Fellowship) has its own Fellowship Hall. 
Frequently these halls give a Fellow access to certain raw goods 
that non-Fellows simply will not find, or if they do will find it 
at a greatly inflated price as sold by Fellowship-owned shops. 
   The Fellowship is important in the life of the city, closely 
affecting the economic welfare of both artisans and consumers. 
It seeks to aid artisans in two principal ways: by protecting 
against the competition of artisans in the same trade in other 
cities, and by protecting from possible competition of fellow 
citizens working in other shops belonging to the same trade. The 
Fellowship makes it difficult for those lacking the capital to 
set up for themselves or without the approval of their peers to 
gain access to materials or knowledge, or to sell into certain 
markets, an area that equally dominated the guilds' concerns.

whatever else manner of filth in existence. A dank smell 
permeates the alley as if not enough air can drift through and 
debris and trash litter the very walkway. To the east, a wooden 
fence has been erected, blocking this alley from the main road

Pelennor and Anorien~
   Pelennor and Anorien sit snugly around the brow of Mount 
Mindolluin, at the easternmost point of which Minas Tirith looms. 
The area stretches east to the shores of the Anduin's western 
bank, south to the harbor of Harlond and north to the town of 
Milton. Pelennor sits within the wall of stone known as Rammas 
Echor. This region covers mostly abundant and prosperous 
farmland, highly populated by famers and village folk. 

Everything outside the Rammas Echor's protective embrace is 
Anorien. Through the northern gate, one may travel far north to 
the town of Milton, or wander up the mountain pass just west of 
the gate and encounter bears, wolves, angry boars and the like. 
To the north east of the gate the great Anorien birchwood nestles 
between the banks of the Anduin as she flows westwards and the 
bastion of the Wardenry at its south east edge. In the mountains 
of Mindolluin, recent discovery of further valleys give cause for 
colonization to begin and one such territory contains a village 
of hillmen who are granted permission to live within the fiefdom 
and under the Lord's rulership. 

Many cabins, cottages, farms and farmsteads stand out among the 
villages and pastures of this fiefdom of Lord Astirian. The 
taxes raised on the villeins go toward the rebuilding after war, 
the strengthening of the Wardenry, the maintenance of roads and 
the continuous patrols ensuring safe passage for farmers and 
merchants to and from the Great Market of Minas Tirith. Lord 
Astirian demands that hunters, miners, farmers and all those who 
would work on the land swear an Oath to him and purchase 
licenses. Villeins may not hunt without such licenses. 


The most popular tavern by far just north east of Minas Tirith is 
the Wardogs Tavern (#3LOOK WARDOG#0).

Osgiliath and Ithilien~
   The city of Osgiliath was once renowned for its beautiful 
architecture, including, but not limited to, its most grand and 
well-known feature - the Dome of Stars, which lies at its center. 
The city was originally called "The Fortress of Stars", taking on 
the appearance of a grand military outpost - and rightfully so, 
as the shadows of Minas Morgul loomed dangerously to the east. 
After the Dark Plague during the Third Age, in 1636, the city 
began to fall apart, however. It soon became widely deserted, 
visited only by passing travellers, and home to few citizens. 
   Ithilien, known as the Land of the Moon, is a huge, forested 
region of eastern Gondor, bordered by the Ephel Duath and the 
river Anduin to the east and west, and the marshland of Nindalf 
and the River Poros to the north and south, respectively. The 
region itself is divided into two fiefdoms - North and South 
Ithilien. 
   After the Siege of Osgiliath and the end of the Watchful 
Peace, the Steward Denethor found Ithilien, a once proud fief of 
Gondor, to be infested with the presence of the Witchking and his 
armies. In an effort to restore the region to Gondorian hands, 
the Steward comissioned, from his own personal cadre and that of 
his son Boromir's, six new Lords of Ithilien, each destined to 
occupy his own portion of lost Ithilien territories. Only five 
remain alive, including Lord Eradan and his Battalion who seek 
recruits to help join his army and retake Ithilien. #AType "Hear

In 2474, after years of attacks in Ithilien, the Witch King led an army of uruks, orcs, trolls and the feared Nazgul to the very gates of Osgiliath. The Gondorian Vanguard, once a proud army holding Ithilien firm, fought in East Osgiliath with valor and courage. Yet it was in vain. As the days went by the Nazgul overwhelmed all resistance and the White Lady of Ithilien herself fell upon the Dome of Stars to shine no more for Gondor or the Men of the West."

In the face of trolls and uruk-hai, the Vanguard faced terror itself and were diminished. In these days the Ecthel, the heavy cavalry of Gondor were all but obliterated as they counter attacked and then stood to allow the others to build defences. Constable Erethalis led them while Tristam rallied his few remaining soldiers to barricade the western gates of the Great Dome."

Tragically, those civilians who believed Osgiliath could never fall were heard for many days as they were discovered and slaughtered by the Enemy. Meanwhile in Anorien, orkin travelled across in rafts in small numbers, with the Wardenry and villeins of that fiefdom fighting side by side to throw them back."

In the last moments, the Witch King spoke Words of Power that shattered the Great Bridge and threw it down. It would not save the armies of Shadow, as great numbers of Gondor's soldiers and knights made passage across the northern fords and met them in Ithilien. A dreadful and bloody series of battles saw thousands die, including many of the Black Numenorean's mightiest warriors. It was to Morgul Vale and the very gates of Minas Morgul that Lord Boromir came. And there he paused, for the armies of Gondor were much diminshed. He turned away and attended to the dead and to the remains of Osgiliath."

atecho 11884 "Thus ended the Summer of 2474. For the next four years the Lords of Ithilien pushed east and sought to retake the fortresses and townships. They succeeded. Yet in 2478 great armies issued from Minas Morgul and war recommenced. Ithilien fell once more to the evil while Lords Dalamir and Andir held onto their fortresses and Lord Eradan led the defence of Osgiliath. Slowly did the armies of the Shadow move west and great works were planned and built in East Osgiliath. In this way did Zogbosh lead his uruk-hai army to the very walls of the city, to face not simply Gondorian soldiers but also fifteen hundreds of volunteers from Minas Tirith, swiftly trained and poorly equipped. Behind them Lord Astirian of Pelennor and Anorien assembled his villeins and Wardenry and stood firm on the western banks of the Anduin, awaiting invasion."

Lord Dalamir's son fell to the blades of the Twisted Eyes of Khagdu and the teeth of their wargs in the small fortress south of Morgulduin. As Zogbosh sent his troops into East Osgiliath, this time the soldiers of Lord Eradan and his allies joined forces and fell back to the carefully-prepared strongholds built throughout the city. Yet, while they inflicted great harm upon the Enemy, Captain Aelinion faced fearful odds on the southern flanks of the city as he rallied his volunteers from the White City. Harried and assaulted on all sides, many fell to arrow, blade and boulder."

Yet in the ruins of the Great Dome, Gondor built their own mangonels and sparred with the Enemy's machines. Through acts of heroism Lord Eradan's soldiers launched well-scouted attacks on the eastern walls, burning the siege engines. Soon, Zogbosh himself entered Osgiliath and threw his remaining forces into the battle. With much at stake, the city volunteers fell in great numbers and Captain Aelinion was slain, with many others falling during a counter attack by Gondor. Minas Tirith would never fully recover from the loss of so many of its bravest and best. It was at this time that the hero of the war, Sergeant Fangird, fell to an arrow, after rallying his troops against great darkness for weeks without rest or pause."

Erethalis avenged those who had fallen, swiftly bringing down the huge uruk leader and tossing his body aside. As the armies of the East turned and fled, Lord Eradan's diminished army cleared the east side of the city of the remaining orkin, then trod east into Ithilien, as trumpets echoed with the message that Lord Dalamir's fortress was attacked."

player-run organization based in Minas Tirith. We welcome both 
inexperienced and experienced players alike. The shelter 
supports non-combat, crafting-oriented characters who enjoy big 
citylife and related social roleplay. 
   Arrangements have been made with some of the city's 
interesting and sometimes colourful Masters and Journeymen to 
provide support and guidance to characters interested in pursuing 
membership in one of the Fellowships. If you have a variety of 
crafting skills and are undecided about which Fellowship you wish 
to pursue, the Shelter is a good place to explore your interests 
before you lock yourself into a specific profession & related 
Fellowship. We have an expansive workroom filled with crafting 
equipment and tools. 
   The Shelter itself is located just a few blocks north of the 
tunnel leading up from the west side of the Sun Plaza, on the 
second circle of Minas Tirith. 
   Messages may be left for the Shelter's overseer with the young 
boy standing outside the front door. To gain entrance/acceptance 
to the Shelter and all it has to offer, please seek out the 
Shelter's Benefactress, #3Agase#0, or her assistant, #3Taigh#0,

The Herbalists of Craban Gador~
   The Tower of Craban Gador, for decades the cloistered haunt of 
the Apothecarist Brynden the Rookborn, has recently been opened 
by him to herbalists and woodsmen of all types wishing to learn 
the herbalist trade and through their efforts supply the needs of 
the Fellowship of Apothecarists. 
As the retainer granted rights over wild herbs and plants in the 
realm, the Tower has two seperate but conjoined groups. While 
all in the Tower are expected to learn the ways of foraging and 
herbalism in time and assist with those efforts, each individual 
is either a sworn villein working the land as a vassal of Lord 
Astirian with all rights and priviledges therein, or may swear as 
an Apprentice in the Fellowship of Apothecarists, who work at the 
Tower with their villein brethren to learn the arts and mysteries 
of herbology, apothecary, alchemy, and medicine. 
Please Hobbitmail #3Cyril#0 for more information and a meeting.

The Malred Merchant House~
   The Malred Merchant House is one of the largest and wealthiest 
merchant houses in game. They specialize in the distribution of 
raw goods and the import and export of merchandise. The House is 
heavily involved in Minas Tirith politics and is a recognized and 
respected name in the community. We offer contracts for 
sponsorship to various Minas Tirith craft Masters, shop owners 
and are expanding their influence to Pelennor, Anorien and 
beyond. 
   The Malred Merchant House is a unique clan in that there are 
vast opportunities. If you are not interested in merchandising 
and politics, no problem! You can still find a place within our 
family. After two years, they will even pay your apprenticeship 
fees so you may join a fellowship. 
   For those who are interested in long-term employment with 
House Malred, you'll find yourself starting out as a servant of 
the house and working your way up the ladder. Who knows, perhaps 
one day your cook will rise to the position of Head of Household 
or Envoy? 
   What do you do next if you are interested? Just head over to 
one of the taverns in Minas Tirith and ask around. With little 
to no effort, you're sure to find the names of the prominent 
members of the House who you can seek IG or send a hobbitmail to 
set up playtimes with.

A Tunnel Leading From The Third Circle~
   From the finely-crafted, sturdy iron gate that can be used to 
block entrance here from Denmoth Tunnel, to the steep incline 
that rises upwards towards the Fourth Circle, this area is well- 
lit by several carefully placed lanterns. Messengers in official 
garb hurry through the tunnel carved from Mindolluin, using it to 
quickly move to fulfill their urgent functions. While too small 
for horses or carts, it is nonetheless wide enough for four 
average-sided men to walk comfortably abreast without stooping or 
being excesssively cramped together.

counters dirtied and muddied by filth, most of the shelves broken 
or shattered in some conflict long past. While a door to the 
north once existed as well, it has been boarded over so 
thoroughly that only a scarce bit of the door itself is actually 
visible behind the nailed wood. The western window, however, has 
been remodeled into a crude doorway. A smooth, square window 
once existed in the southern wall before its panes were 
shattered, leaving only a gaping hole there now.

crude trail however the area would be aflower with all manner of 
weeds, from dandelions to milkweeds. An abandoned, smallish 
stoop lays to the northern way while the southern is occupied by 
a large, but climbable, rubble mountain. The western edge of the

The Army of Gondor Clan Hall~
   The Battalion of Lord Eradan is the eastern most army, of 
several that are keeping the enemy at bay, protecting the lands 
and peoples of Gondor and Minas Tirith. It is a highly skilled 
and well-outfitted military organization whose purpose is to 
reclaim the land of Ithilien and to defend Gondor. Those wishing 
to take part in the destruction of the enemy by joining the 
Battalion need to have seen at least sixteen winters and be of 
stout heart. But know well, this is a dangerous role with death 
always creeping up behind you. As a soldier, and mind you a 
soldier is what you'll be, you will encounter vicious wargs, vile 
orcs, mighty trolls and all kinds of unspeakable evils created 
and corrupted by the Enemy. If, in spite of such terrors, your 
willingness and bravery still hold, you are welcome to join the 
brotherhood of soldiers that continue to defy the power of the 
enemy. But, as each soldier's life depends on the soldier 
standing next to him, you will be expected to show that you are 
disciplined and that you can follow orders. And yet, if you have 
a mind to it, exhibit potential leadership skills and through 
dedicated service seek promotion to positions of increased 
responsibilities. Lastly, you must be willing to swear and honor 
an oath of service to Lord Eradan and the mighty lands of Gondor.

The Hawk and Dove Clan Hall~
   The Hawk and Dove Company is part of Lord Astirian's auxilary 
military force, and is extensively used for training villeins and 
the Wardenry. During the recent Siege on Osgiliath, and the 
Battle of the Anduin, the Company's forces were regularly 
deployed to battle fronts.

As well as its close ties with the Wardenry, the Hawk and Dove 
Company has a strong working alliance with the Battalions, 
providing the major routes of supply to and from Minas Tirith and 
the Pelennor to wherever battle forces happen to be at the time. 
This can sometimes involve travel across Ithilien, and direct 
engagement in combat with the enemy. The Company is also 
responsible for running the Post Offices in Minas Tirith and the 
Pelennor, and for safe delivery of packages and parcels.

Recent important changes have taken place at the Hawk and Dove 
Company, as a result of Katalyn, its owner, being promoted to the 
position of Yeoman of the Wardenry. She now has a pressing need 
to recruit several men and women to help her expand into the new 
role her promotion has brought her. 

Over the years, experience has taught her that the most valuable 
assets that any new potential recruit can bring to her Company 
are those they carry within themselves - honesty, loyalty, 
commitment, willingness to learn, a sense of humour and a desire 
to become an invaluable, trusted member of a smooth-running 
efficient team. Everything beyond these qualities can be taught 
to suitable candidates. 

The activites of the Hawk and Dove Company are remarkably 
diverse. Members are all trained in armed combat, and archery. 
Those individuals with crafting skills are fully supported and 
provided for, working in the newly built, well-equipped Craft 
Hall. Hunters are trained in all related and necessary skills. 
Among their number the Hawk and Dove count woodworkers, miners, 
timberwrights, metalcrafters, leatherworkers, bakers, cooks, 
fletchers. 

From these ranks over the next year or so, Katalyn will draw the 
best to form the Hawk and Dove Guard, an elite mounted group of 
archers and soldiers charged with the duty to defend the fiefdom 
of Lord Astirian in the event of severe threat, and to fight at 
the Lord's side and in his name in battle.

OOC: To discuss any aspect of this role please contact Katalyn by 
hobbitmail or step outside these halls and type "enter carriage"
to visit Wardogs Tavern, close to the Hawk and Dove where you can
leave word there.

atecho 11640 "The Hawk and Dove Company was founded in the autumn of 2474 by Melandril and Katalyn Pelenar, distantly related to House Aranin. Recently married, they set up business in the Alehouse on the Second Tier of Minas Tirith while Katalyn's father and brothers completed work on their farmstead in the Pelennor, a few leagues east of Wardogs tavern."

atecho 11640 "Originally, the Hawk and Dove wished to offer guard duty, deliveries, letter writing, military training and messenger services to all in Gondor. Early successes involved guarding the exhibition of the treasures retrieved from the Osgiliath Undercity by Daeren and her Rose company, as sponsored by Tiernen of the Merchant House Sindbar. Along with message carrying and other guard duties, the Hawk and Dove started to become a success, recruiting more members and moving into the farmstead finally in 2475."

After purchasing company licenses for hunting, logging and the like, eventually they won a contract with Cerech, Senior Quartermaster to Lord Eradan in 2476, resulting in monthly deliveries of goods to Lord Eradan's Battalion, wherever it may be based."

Earning a good reputation with the military, the Hawk and Dove also began the training of all Wardenry squires, future Wardens including Blair, Hedelon and Kamard."

From there they built up post boxes and a back office, from which all employees can collect and deliver letters and parcels across Gondor. In 2477, the Hawk and Dove served alongside the Wardenry and soldiers of Lord Eradan in combat on the mountain trails of Mindolluin during the discovery of the new valley and the invasion of the creatures from there. Many died defending the Anorien from them and the Hawk and Dove stood alongside officers of the Battalion as well as senior wardens at the final assault to pacify the valley."

atecho 11640 "In 2478, having sworn an Oath to serve and protect the Lord in times of trouble and strife, the war in Osgiliath and beyond demanded a high level of workload - training hundreds of villeins in the Wardogs fields. The Hawk and Dove served under Bannerman Raeth of the Cadre of Retainer Gowan to fulfil that Oath. In the battles that followed several from the Hawk and Dove lost their lives, including Hirram, Aldemar, Kalypso and Katalyn's husband Melandril. Survivors, now recognised veterans and heroes of the war include Katalyn, Bennit, Kavarn and Imharn, with Halathadir serving alongside them in the last weeks of the war when Katalyn led dozens of Battalion and Wardenry troops to hold the eastern walls of Osgiliath and repair the gates."

As a result of this service and sacrifice, as well as years of friendship and devotion to the villeins, Katalyn now runs a company based from the farmstead, but actually now spanning two farms, Home and Mountain, and a recent expansion northwards to encompass the old tannery yard and barracks as gifted from Lord Astirian in return for training the squires and future Wardens.

In his memory, Katalyn continues to devote her energies to the growth of the Hawk and Dove and its training in military excellence.

Plaza of the Moon~
   The cobblestones of this area of the plaza look to have been 
replaced within recent times, of a brilliant white color that 
hides some of the dirt that travelers bring in. The plaza as a 
whole extends to the south and east, with buildings surrounding 
the entirety of it. To the west, one such recently-renovated 
structure looms.

   Clean white cobblestones run underfoot, recently replaced and 
devoid of cracks and imperfections. People pass through the area 
at all times of the day, though the tracks of mud and dirt as 
well as the unpleasant reminder of horses' former presence within 
rarely remain for long before being cleaned. For the most part, 
it seems to be relatively well-kept, as the reminders of those 
crossing are erased.

   While the nicely-tended plaza continues in all other 
directions, it nonetheless comes to a pause to the east at the 
doors of the newly remodeled building set there. The sweet scent 
of flowers occasionally fills the air above all other smells, and 
lingers as a light presence here from both the eastern direction 
and the general southwest. In that direction, the center of the 
plaza boasts a quiet sward. 
   To the east, a gate leads to a massive mansion.

cobblestones that indicate the plaza. It continues in the 
general eastern direction, as well as both to the north and to

   Just west of where the plaza connects with the road trailing

people swell into this section of it. A variety of people walk 
through, some dressed in nearly rags, while others are dressed in 
fine clothing. Most seem to be busy, intent on their tasks as 
they step through. 
   Against the northern side of the plaza, a quaint, round, one 
level shop stands in modesty. A plain, wooden door leads inward, 
above that, a green painted sign hangs from two small chains. 
Before the shop is a pale-yellow-trimmed stall, a counter draped 
in matching fabric visible inside.

Within the Plaza of the Sun~
   The bustle of people passing through the plaza continues at 
all hours of the day, unwashed, poor-looking citizens passing 
right alongside the wealthier as they walk along the pristine 
white cobblestones that make up the plaza. In all directions, 
shops and stalls are visible, with vendors wandering the area to 
try to sell their wares.

   As the plaza extends all around, lined with shops and stands 
of every type, the activity follows the path of the well-kept 
white cobblestones that mark the constraints of the plaza. To 
the north, it draws to a close, a road snaking out of it and 
continuing on as far as can be seen; not far to the south, the 
center of the plaza is visible.

to run out. In all directions, the white cobblestones lead to 
shops, stalls, and stands, as well as vendors determined to sell 
to all passing through.

   Nearing the northeastern portion of the plaza, the formation 
of the plaza square causes the people within to push closer 
together, the poor mingling with the wealthy as each citizen 
carries out their errands and passes through. Each cobblestone 
under foot is well-tended, white and gleaming in every bit of 
light.

far to the north. The plaza extends in the other two directions, 
filled with countless merchants and people passing through. 
Sounds and smells are overwhelming in their variety, similar to 
those seen within the square. To the east, the door opens into 
the Cherry Blossom's Shopfront.

Plaza of the Sun~
   Nearing the far western portion of the plaza, just northeast 
of a gate, the crowds thicken here, making it difficult to walk 
through. Many push their way through the others walking the 
clean cobblestones as well as past the insistent vendors on their 
way. For the most part, the citizens who continue northward seem 
to be less than finely-dressed, though there are many exceptions 
to this. Directly west, a door is situated, leading into a shop 
that specializes in men's clothing. 
   A rich-indigo-trimmed stall has been set up here, a variety of 
books, glassware, and herbal preparations on display here. At 
the back of the stall hangs a cloth emblazoned with the symbols 
for the Fellowship of Sages and the Fellowship of Healers in 
silver embroidery.

along the path of the gleaming white cobblestones underfoot. The 
scents of food and alcohol occasionally drift along the air, as 
well as the unwashed smells of the poorer citizens and horses 
that pass through. 
   In the middle of the area here, a stall trimmed in forest 
green cloth has been erected, displaying pieces of finely-worked 
furniture and shelves filled with a wide variety of goods from 
leather goods, farm produce, and other items.

   Directly northwest of the center of the plaza, this section of 
clean, well-kept cobblestones boasts an enormous amount of 
activity as people cross through it. The mixture of classes and 
the volume of citizens passing through causes them to pass 
alongside each other, usually within close proximity. In all 
directions, shops, stalls, and stands can be seen surrounding and 
speckling the plaza. 
   A vernal-green-trimmed stall stands here, its counter draped 
in the same color fabric.

is visible, while the crowds thicken here as they near it. The 
cobblestones, clean and uncracked, extend in all directions as 
they lead towards the shops on the outskirts of the plaza. 
Different vendors wander through the crowds, loudly shouting to 
advertise their wares or stands. 
   A slate-blue-trimmed stall displays tanned hides here, and a 
large stag has been painted in white upon the back of the stall's 
wall.

section, seeming to have been recently fixed up, is heavily 
traversed by people intent on visiting the various shops and

blocking further passage in that direction. In all of the other 
directions, however, the white cobblestones of the plaza extend 
towards more shops as people traverse them, eager to pass through 
the more tightly packed sections. Directly to the southeast, the 
gates leading from the city are visible. 
   A wooden sign, with a painted dove and hawk, hangs above a 
building on the eastern edge of the plaza.

Plaza of the Sun~
   Citizens from all over Minas Tirith gather here to do their 
day's shopping while all other kinds of merchants, farmers, 
trappers, and fisherman bring in their goods from a constant flow 
of traffic from the grand gates of the city to the East. This 
open marketplace is filled with transient vendors, their stalls 
all bright and varied in color. 
   Between the gate leading into the tunnels thats visible in the 
western direction, and the fountain of the center of the plaza 
that's easily seen towards the east, this section of the square 
is heavily travelled by the poor and rich alike.

far to the west, and the gates leading from the city easily seen 
only a short distance away to the east. Still, the cobblestones 
of the plaza, a gleaming white in color, continue to extend in 
every direction, leading towards shops and stalls as people cross 
them.

The Fur and Hide Market Buyers, Within the Plaza~
   This section of the market is where the furriers ply their 
trade. The cured and uncured pelts of wild animals and domestic 
animals alike are hung up upon racks or displayed flat upon the 
tables and stalls of the merchants and hawkers that work here. 
There is a strong, unpleasant smell that taints the air. Hunters 
and trappers from afar bring in their wares, but not always as 
fresh as would be desired.

The Fish Market Buyers Within the Plaza of the Sun~
   Here in what is probably the foulest smelling portion of the 
prestiguous Great Market of Minas Tirith, the air is full of the 
scent of freshly-caught, smoked , and salted fish, the mixture of 
smells baffling to the senses. The market is stocked with both 
fresh and saltwater fish brought up freshly each morning from the 
port of Harlond. Seagulls and other sea birds flock around the 
area often picking through the discarded scraps and fish guts. 
   The plaza continues from here, the brilliant white and 
seemingly recently-replaced cobblestones leading to the shops and 
stalls in the area.

The Wild Game and Bargain Meat Buyers, South of Stalls~
   High quality wild fowl and whole sides of the finest venison 
can be purchased from the peddlars, hucksters and market men that 
hold the pitches in this portion of the meat market. Sharing 
this area with the wild game marketeers are the low-priced and 
bargain stalls selling a variety of cheap and cheerful meats and 
offal. Bedraggled, rough, weathered and fur-clad hunters 
commonly frequent this area, eager to find a good price for their 
prey. The cobblestones are regularly awash with blood and guts 
and the smell at times can be quite unpleasant. 
   Immediately northwest, gates lead into the messenger tunnels 
while a door leads west directly into the Annon Borough Gym.

The Vegetable Market Buyers, Southeast of the Plaza Center~
   The vegetable market is full of loud and boisterous hucksters 
and marketeers plying their trade. The calls of the prices 
resound throughout the area mixing into one great noise. The 
stalls are stacked high with seasonal vegetables. A great mess 
of boxes and bags lie about the cobblestones along with the odd 
piece of discarded poor quality or rotten vegetable. 
   The center of the plaza's activity is visible just northwest 
of here, the number of people drawing through it increasing as 
well as the diversity of those crossing.

The Ore and Lumber Buyers, Near a Stable~
   Home to raw industrial goods of all types, this northeastern 
quarter of the Great Market is filled to the brim with carts of 
slag and stone, crates of ingots and stacks of lumber. The 
stalls here are large and widely spaced, granting this section 
the feel of an open warehouse. Goods here are bought in bulk, 
and loaded onto carts by an army of hired hands. The pathways 
are crooked, worn by heavy traffic, and branch off to the west 
and south. 
   The musky odor of horses and sweat permeates the air each time 
the wind drifts in from the east where a set of double-doors lead 
into a large stable.

   This section of the plaza boasts a wealthier-seeming 
population than the rest, this trend only increasing towards the 
southwestern portion of it. A door stands to the west, leading 
into a shop that stands currently closed, while in all other 
directions, clean white cobblestones extend towards busier 
sections of the plaza. Shops are visible in the distance in 
nearly all directions.

Within the Plaza of the Sun~
   This is an open marketplace filled with transient vendors of 
all sorts of raw materials. The smell of skinned animal pelts 
mingles with the aroma of fresh produce. Citizens from all over 
Minas Tirith gather here to do their day's shopping, while 
farmers, trappers, skinners, and fishermen bring their goods from 
the wilderness, along with the dream of becoming wealthy, or at 
least earning enough to put bread on the table. The cobbles, 
despite the heavy activity, look to be new and recently-replaced.

of traffic from the grand gates of the city to the East. This 
open marketplace is filled with transient vendors, their stalls 
all bright and varied in color. 
   To the northeast through the stalls, one can spot the high 
arch of the white fountain that dominates the center of the 
Plaza.

Within the Plaza of the Sun~
   While to the north, the bustle of the activity remains close 
but the people within have plenty of room to walk, the plaza 
comes to a close to the south, narrowing into a densely-traveled 
road. As the worn cobblestones of the plaza lead in the northern 
direction, lined by shops and stands, people do their best to 
avoid the more jagged and less well-kept edges of the broken 
cobbles. Here, however, and in the western direction, walking is 
smooth due to the recent replacement of those aged cobblestones 
with new, unflawed stones.

leading to shops and stalls, as well as some official buildings 
within the square. The volume of people passing through this 
section of the square is high, of mixed class and stature, as 
they cross through. Vendors pass through the streets to try to 
coax citizens into buying what they have to offer, approaching 
rich and poor alike.

passing through find themselves packed into closer proximity of 
one another, forced in many cases to brush against people of 
different classes than they. Northwards, the plaza continues, 
the largest part of the plaza extending to the west. Shops and 
buildings line the entirety of the square.

The Dairy Market Buyers in the Southwest Corner of the Plaza~
   Jars of cream, buttermilk, and honey sit neatly row upon row 
on the many shelves behind the counters of the stalls of the 
dairy market workers. Larger items like buckets of milk and 
giant wheels of cheese sit neatly upon the counters. There is an 
air of neatness and cleaniness about this portion of the market. 
Most of the stalls are tucked up tightly against the second 
circle wall of the city. Many of those passing here looking to 
be in official or slightly better than average dress as they rush 
through. 
   Activity swells near the door leading westward, though few 
trickle into the building immediately south that is the 
Fellowship Office.

The Fruit Market Buyers Within the Plaza~
   Just to the west of here, the plaza begins to come to an end, 
a street leading southward crossing with the square. South, the 
front of a building rises up, the cobblestones ending at the 
front wall of it. In the other directions, the plaza continues, 
leading towards official buildings and merchant-operated shops 
alike. 
   This area of the market has been set aside for trading in 
fruits. The strong smell of ripe stone and soft fruits wafts 
from stall to stall. The barrows are piled high with colourful 
fruits all year around, each season displaying its own unique 
suite of delicious, plump and exotic fruits.

The Jewel of Minas Tirith~
   While the building itself is rather small and unimpressive, 
the room has been decorated with very rich furnishings. Several 
tapestries that are dyed in exquisite colors and beaded with 
semi-precious stones are arranged on either side of the small 
door in the southern wall of the shop. The engraved furniture, 
for the most part, is stained a rich dark-brown tone. Very few 
items are actually on display, the shopkeeper usually walks over 
to one of the small locked cabinets arranged around the room in 
order to retrieve an item requested by a customer.

A Large, Spacious Brewery~
   The four walls of this brewery are set with enough distance to 
each other to give a significant amount of room to move around 
in, even when it's been filled with the equipment needed and the 
storage required for the task. Comprised of stone, the walls and 
flooring hold in the temperature, maintaining it throughout the 
hours of the day. Directly north lies a separate storage area. 
At the back of the brewery, a ramp leads up to a sturdy cellar 
door.

ash and crumbs, with few knots or cracks marring its surface.

seem smaller and more intimate in appearance. Flickering candles

Amongst A Series of Hovels~
   Just past the eastern fence, this large area provides some 
miniscule amount of privacy, with the remnants of the fence still 
lingering in existance. One of, if not the, most prevalent 
aspects of this area is the constant stench of various odors: 
bodies who have went unwashed for far too long, the sharp tang of 
urine and blood, and the heavier, overriding scent of feces. 
Scattered about this miniscule alleyway is a series of small 
boxes and shanties, rough dwellings composed of others 
thrown-away refuse and trash. Occasionally, a bum or other 
homeless person can be seen drifting about them. What otherwise 
would have been a dead end, someone has expanded in true ghetto 
fashion--While the northern and southern walls are brick, the 
wall that used to reside to the east was made of wood and has, 
since then, been violated and transformed into a rough, jagged 
doorway.

"Silver Linings" - Women's Section~
   This shopfront is kept meticulously clean and brightly lit. 
The richly stained pinewood floors bear the wear and tear of an 
aged building, but nonetheless they are cared for well. Shelves, 
racks, and a couple of mannequins occupy most of the space here, 
displaying the women's cloth wares of the merchant who keeps shop 
here. The patronage here varies, but is primarily composed of 
middle-class customers. The eastern door leads back into the 
Plaza, while the western door opens deeper into the back of the 
shop. A fitting room lies to the south, while northward lies 
another section of the shopfront.

A Room of Soiled Cots and Broken Floors~
   The smell of body odor is nigh overwhelming in this 
average-sized room of rough, broken floors and hole-filled walls. 
More of a flophouse rather than displaying any sort of order or 
organization, it is characterized oft times by the numbers of 
still, sleeping forms beneath filthy, lice-ridden blankets. The 
sounds of the street are vaguely heard from the northern way, 
while the south is usually quiet, save for brief flurries of 
shouting or violence. A staircase winds upwards from here, the 
solid wood of it worn on the steps and dusty on the banister, 
though few of those within the building actually go up those 
stairs; they all seem to avoid the foot of them.

A Murky Alley~
   This area is murky and dank even during the daylight, most of 
the cobblestones long ago either stolen, vandalized, or broken to 
leave this area often-times muddy and a trap for those to whom 
cleanliness is a must. Slight bits of moss and other signs of 
lower-class plant life can be seen slowly taking over the walls 
and ground. The buildings to the east and western sides of this 
alley are of impassive stone, while a beaten-up wooden door lies 
to the south.

Standing About a Barrel-Fire~
   This area is cast in near perpetual shade and would fall into 
inky black darkness, were it not for the old, ash-scarred 
trashcan in the middle of this area. It burns at nigh all hours 
of the day and night, fueled with bits of refuse and does a 
passable job at illuminating the rough hovels and decrepit 
shanties around the area. Most seem to be composed of bits of 
shattered wood and rusting metal, but seem to, through the grace 
of some force unseen, seem to be standing. A number of 
moth-eaten, fiercely stained couches litter the area about the 
flaming barrel.

Within a Dimly Lit Hovel~
   The walls of this small hovel seem to be composed mainly of 
hundreds of pieces of shattered wood and broken metal, several 
pieces which have rust holes clean through their composure. The 
ground is dirt and has been pounded hard by apparent frequent 
travel through this rough area. The only apparent furniture is a 
worn, rice-ridden sleeping mat on the floor.

An Inviting Dormitory~
   This dormitory is lined with a few bunks, matching chests at 
the foot of each. The room itself has a homey feel to it, the 
walls painted a soft golden color while creamy ivory molding runs 
along the ceiling and floors. A wooly rug runs underfoot over 
well-fitted floorboards and an ivory-curtained window is set in 
the northern wall. 
   The sounds of the kitchen can be heard to the south.

clothing within the tiny storage room. The shelves and racks

unoccupied by some sort of storage mechanism.

   Clean, pale grey cobblestones line this circular courtyard, 
coming to a pause to the west before a solid, wide door and to 
the east before a high metal gate. To the north and south, the 
area is enclosed by the gate that encloses the courtyard into a 
square shape. On the outskirts are trees and plants that are 
well-maintained throughout all months of the year. Very few pass 
into this quiet sanctuary, and when they do, they make little 
noise.

An Entry Area and Sitting Room~
   This rather large room gives plenty of space to move around, 
the various pieces of furniture set this way and that still doing 
little to inhibit that amount of room. The walls surrounding it 
are a light beige color, making it seem bigger still. A door has 
been set into each them, one leading north into a study, another 
south leading into a dining room, a third opening to the 
courtyard just before the street, and the last leading west 
through solid glass doors. An intricately carved staircase winds 
upwards from here.

taking up little of the northern and southern walls. On either 
side of each doorway, a lamp has been situated, keeping the hall 
brightly lit. At the far eastern edge of the hall, a staircase 
winds downwards into the entry to the home.

   Perfectly-kept and well-organized, this room's furniture is 
neatly arranged to give the maximum amount of space possible in 
the already large bedroom. Each furnishing is placed with a 
slight amount of room between it and the walls, to keep it from

allows little outside noise to filter in. A small patio area of 
light grey cobblestones extends from just beside the glass doors 
leading inside inwards, though it doesn't take up much of the 
garden space. In the rest, small shrubs and plants are given 
space to grow. Another small door leads southwards through an 
oak door into a kitchen area.

Minas Tirith Guard Public Office~
   This relatively small, square room has been left plain and 
functional. The cold stone walls are unadorned save for a large 
black banner bearing the White Tree, which covers most of the 
western wall. Beneath the banner on the western side of the room 
sits a small table and chairs, while the eastern end of the room 
is dominated by a sturdy looking gate through which a holding 
cell can be seen. A large door leads back out on to the plaza to 
the north, and a third small door sits in the center of the 
southern wall. The room is assaulted by a constant bustle of 
activity as the conversations of various groups of citizens and 
Guards converge into an incessant din.

   The quiet privacy of this small room is interrupted only by 
the faint murmuring of distant conversation which seeps through 
the northern door, hinting at the activity of the room beyond. 
Brightly lit by a number of wall lamps, this room is mostly taken 
up by a large desk and a set of comfortable looking chairs that 
face it. There are no windows in the walls, the only break in 
the dark stone being the door in the northern wall which leads 
back into the Public Office of the Minas Tirith Guard.

   Cramped and uncomfortable, this small holding cell is nothing 
more than a small area of the larger room to the west which has 
been sectioned off by a thick stone wall in which a sturdy 
looking gate is set. Small enough that it would be a struggle to 
fit more than three adults at once, there is nothing in this room 
to make it more pleasant, the only decoration on the walls being 
a scattering of graffiti which has been scratched crudely into 
the wall.

   This room is made of light-grey stones, giving it a spacious 
appearance even though it is quite small. A long, wooden counter 
extends from one wall, taking up most of the room and leaving the 
remainder of the lobby somewhat cramped with no place to sit. 
Double doors to the west lead into the training hall where the 
clanging of weapons can be heard and eastwards leads out to the 
Sun Plaza and the noises of merchants, revellers and hawkers.

A Wide Landing~
   A sturdy, reinforced door situated at the top of the stairs 
provides privacy from the eyes and ears of the establishment's 
patrons below. The scents and sounds associated with a busy 
tavern filter up through the floorboards at all times of the 
night and day. A simple, argent-grey, wool rug covers the floor, 
while several strategically placed bronze sconces provide ample 
lighting. A cream-painted door set in the northern wall leads to 
a private suite, a grey-painted door set in the eastern wall 
leads to a private office, a small glass-paned door set in the 
western wall leads out to the rooftop garden, and an umber- 
painted door set in the southern wall leads to another private 
room.

paths in it branching off to the north-east and north-west. In 
the north-east corner is a small clearing for a compost bin and a 
small collection of tools. The south-east corner is home to a 
herb garden. Though the space is private and secluded, the 
sounds of the busy plaza filter up from below.

A Filthy Intersection of Paths~
   This intersection forms something of an overweight 'T', with 
paths leading east and west, as well as one south. The northern 
wall is seemingly sturdy enough, composed of lichen-slickened 
bricks. The ground beneath the feet of any travelers would be 
composed of trampled weeds and mud, making transversing this area 
after any sort of precipitation a tricky affair. A large balcony 
juts over this intersection from the northern building, casting 
the center of this intersection into permanent shadow.

   This area shows the remnants of finery, from the finer, if 
still aged, wood of the eastern and western buildings, and the 
estranged cobblestone still visible in the muddy ground beneath 
the odd traveler's feet. These symbols of civilized living, 
however, are few and far between as progress inside this dank 
alleyway continues to move south to north, northwards continuing 
in much the same, southwards a lighter area within sight.

Walking Between Close-Crowded Buildings~
   A single man could walk through this alley without having his 
shoulders scrape the grime and mud-spattered walls to his north 
and south as he progresses onwards and through this long alley. 
While the area itself is rather dark and holds a rather grubby 
atmosphere, the eastern way holds light: The cobblestones of Rath 
Celerdain are visible, the sounds of its traffic reaching into 
this rather depressing niche. Embedded in the northern wall, 
however, is a pane-less window, all of its glass long-ago broken 
and shattered.

Atop a Wide Landing~
   A seemingly once-grand stairway winds down from here, the 
railings covered in a thin layer of dust that's been worn away in 
some places. All in all, the wood appears to be holding up 
nicely, giving testament to its craftsmanship. Still, it's been 
worn in places, scratched and dull on the steps themselves. A 
portion of the railing near the top of the stairs is missing 
entirely, splinters marking the place it once was. The floor's 
carpet has been ripped up in places, though appears to be almost 
entirely untouched as it nears the northern doorway, where a 
busted door sways lightly in its frame.

A Dim, Well-Preserved Room~
   The small amount of light that manages to penetrate the grime 
of the northern and western windows give hints of the room's 
dimensions, indicating that it's larger than average. Despite 
the dusty condition of the room, and the busted nature of the 
door, it appears to be almost perfectly preserved: the furniture 
is still intact, showing few signs of damage. The curtains are 
moth-eaten in places but still maintain some degree of wholeness. 
While the carpet remains on the floor, it does not hold the same 
untouched quality of the rest of the room--dark stains provide 
discoloring of the once-light color.

   Stretching from a wide landing just to the west, this hallway 
extends quite a ways, stopped by a wall to the north, the 
remnants of a door to the south, and narrowing into a room to the 
east. It is eerily silent, the floor underfoot solid enough to 
prevent creaking despite the worn appearance of the wood. The 
walls are caked in a layer of grime, a few lines showing in it as 
though someone's trailed a finger along it or something has 
brushed against it.

perfectly cut square just beneath the dark window of the eastern 
wall. All four walls are covered in a layer of filth and grime, 
cobwebs stretching along the ceiling.

A Large Room with a Darkly Stained Floor~
   Small tufts of carpet still cling to the boards of this 
cracking, heavily-stained floor, seeming to have been hastily 
ripped up. Around those and on other sections of the floor, dark 
stains spread across the wood, lighter in some places and holding 
the faint, rusty scent of old blood. Two windows, one on the 
western wall and one on the eastern, give only the slightest 
hints of light, grime covering almost all of the glass. Tattered 
remnants of curtains, of a formerly fine material, hide some of 
the surface from view. Hints of light show from the ceiling, 
hinting at places where the wood is rotting. The door leading 
into the southern room is wobbly, barely remaining on its hinges, 
and the door leading to the hallway just north of here is in 
splintered pieces.

In a Dank, Poorly-Lit Room~
   The tattered remains of opulence are evident in this room, 
from the strings of curtains barely covering even a small amount 
of the grime-covered window, to the ruined furnishings that are 
barely functional now. The window, set against the southern 
wall, is so heavily coated in dirt and filth that the single 
place it's been cleared to reveal a small peephole stands out 
starkly against the rest of it. Only a small amount of light 
shines in from that tiny clearing in the window, a single 
oil-burning lamp providing the only other reprieve from the 
darkness. The places where carpeting has been ripped up are 
still jagged, the wood splintered. A heavy musky smell has 
descended over the room, unpleasant and nearly overwhelming.

Near the Plaza of the Sun~
   This area is something of a borderland; the light and bustle 
of the Plaza of the Sun lies to the south, while the northern way 
seems to be desolate of any sort of regular companionship, the 
area there dank, wet, and dark. The ground at this point would 
still be marked with a relatively common number of cobblestones 
though, as if a steam were being kinked off, they steadily lessen 
as one would progress northwards.

A Damaged Area of a Dismal Building~
   An arched, carved doorway leads from the west, providing a 
perverse contrast to the gloomy, stench-ridden environment in its 
intricate elegance. The floor is of a solid wood, scorched in 
one large, darkened patch near the northern wall. Crude edges of 
a wall are visible halfway through the room, wooden beams rising 
from the floor to the ceiling seeming to aid in holding it up as 
well as once providing the foundation for a wall separating this 
room from another. Now, though, most of it has been removed, 
leaving a large space that makes the two rooms into one. The 
shattered remains of a glass door lead outside to the far end of 
the room in the eastern direction, jagged and presenting risk to 
most who would pass through.

An Overgrown, Enclosed Area~
   The shattered remains of a glass door lead into this outdoors 
area that is enclosed on three sides by large stone walls. Ivy 
and moss creep up it, leaving little of its surface open to view. 
A garden table has been marred with a layer of mold near the 
bottom of it, the stone discolored and crumbling in places. The 
plants run out of control, overgrown and wild, dead bushes lining 
the edges of the walls.

Atop a Mud-Worn Trail Behind a Scrap-Iron Rimmed House~
   A trail of packed dirt, or sopping mud as the weather may 
dictate, leads in from the east and seems to lead directly to the 
back of this large shack. It takes up the entirety of the width 
between the buildings to the north and the south and seems to be 
composed of half wood and half iron scraps, most of which rattle; 
in a fierce enough gale, some of these iron flaps even lift 
upwards to reveal glimpses into the shack. The area is, for the 
most part, relatively quiet and devoid of the usual noise of 
Minas Tirith.

Within a Shanty Composed of Wood and Iron Scraps~
   Aside from a bare pallet on the floor, this area is rather 
devoid of any sort of personality or useful items, having long 
ago been stripped of anything of that nature by scavengers. The 
western doorway is narrow, while the eastern wall looks flimsy at 
best, downright untrustful at worst. Whenever a heavy wind moves 
in from the western doorway, it rattles and sometimes outright 
lifts up the flaps that compose the eastern wall.

At One End of the Hallway~
   The noises and activity of the branch office just beyond the 
northern door are mostly muffled by the thick wooden door that 
takes up its frame. The hallway here extends some ways south, 
the doors to offices on either side bearing golden plaques to 
identify them. Lamps provide some lighting, but the hallway 
itself is rather dimly lit.

In a Cramped Backroom~
   Simple and small, this backroom seems to have been designed 
more for the sake of practicality than excess comfort. Only 
enough space exists to have the minimum amount of furnishings and 
shelves necessary, and even then little room is left for easy 
maneuvering through. A door leads out into the main room of the 
shop to the east, standing opposite the door to the west that 
leads into the workroom. Sliding doors close off the entrance to 
the kitchen, while a set of stairs leads upwards into a loft.

   While the lack of space in the backroom immediately south of

kitchen. Instead, the tightness of quarters takes on a cozy 
note, as the furniture is small and manageable, easy to use and 
pass along. The four walls are modestly-furnished with just 
what's needed, with nothing extra burdening them.

A Cozy Entryway~
   What this small, open entryway sacrifices in overall size, it 
makes up for it with an inviting and cozy feel. The large, 
rectangular white stones of the walls contrast rather pleasantly 
with the soft oak-brown color of the wooden floor. The stones 
extend upwards to meet the gently steepled roof, the timbers and 
supports found there the same darkly stained oak as the floor. 
There is a soft, grey room rug upon the floor, covering the 
majority of the floorboards. Flanking the tall, rectangular 
door, a pair of circular glass windows look onto the street 
beyond, crossed vertically and horizontally with thin, stained 
oak supports. A simple iron chandelier dangles from the high 'V' 
of the roof, providing a warm light in times of darkness.

A Comfortably-Apportioned Sitting Room~
   Just like the rest of this small and cozy house, the walls of 
this square room are made of a clean white stone, and the floors 
have been fashioned from long, vertical planks of darkly-stained 
oak. Covering a sizable portion of the wooden floor is a 
rectangular rug of simple make and design, a rich midnight-blue 
in color. Set into one wall, all of which end in a flat wooden 
ceiling of matching oak, is a circular window, letting in an 
ample amount of light during the daytime. Beside each doorway 
leading from this sitting room hangs a simple glass lantern, 
providing the room with a warm glow when necessary. A sturdy 
oaken staircase is set against the far wall, the same glass 
lanterns clinging to the wall nearby as it makes its ascent to 
the second floor.

A Simple, Square Dining Room~
   The walls of this simple chamber have been neatly fashioned 
from white stone and end in a pointed roof of thick oak timbers 
and the accompanying supports and cross-beams. Draped across the 
wooden planks of the floor is a simple, rectangular rug of rich 
midnight blue fibers. A simple chandelier dangles from the point 
of the ceiling and simple glass lanterns hang beside each 
doorway, the combination lending an inviting glow to the room in 
times of darkness.

floor of this cosy room. The walls are fashioned of the same 
clean white stone that runs through the entire house, and set 
into three walls are large circular glass windows, providing a 
panoramic view of the surrounding city, particularly the street 
below. Simple glass lanterns hang upon the wall to provide ample 
light in times of need.

A Small Roof Garden~
   This section of roof is lower than that of the rest of the 
building, creating a fairly small, flat square of white stone, 
bordered on two sides by a knee high battlement. The remaining 
two sides of the small roof garden meet with the walls of the 
second story of the house proper, one of which holds a large pair 
of glass doors leading back inside. Various plants and trees 
grow from small stone planters and pots lining the borders of the 
roof.

A Heavily Guarded Room in the Council Building~
   Set within the northern reaches of the Council building, this 
room lacks the small comforts that the other rooms hold, seeming 
to exist only to serve one purpose: to hold records and allow 
those records to be perused by those able to cross into the room. 
As it is heavily guarded, this section of the library is rarely 
accessed, and those within are usually in official garb. Large, 
sturdy bookshelves line the walls, and long, hard tables have 
been provided for those within. A single door to the outh allows 
entry to and exit from the room, sturdy and iron-banded.

A Small, Faded-Granite Storefront~
   Faded grey with time, the granite blocks of this small shop 
are a testament to Minas Tirith's engineering prowess. Though 
the wooden doorframes and doors themselves have likely been 
replaced dozens of times - and appear to need replacement once 
more - the once-white walls are in prime condition, other than 
their fading. Throughout the room, old, scarred wooden tables 
and counters present metal goods of all sorts for purchase. 
   A door leads to the north, into the recesses of the foundry, 
while another door leads south, back into the alley.

A Warm, Cluttered Workroom~
   Utalitarian in its design, the floor of this workroom is 
sunken two steps further down than the rest of the building. 
Metalworking utensils litter the area, with a forge in the 
northwestern corner and a solid stone workbench built into the 
northern and eastern walls, broken only by the eastern doorway - 
which seems to be crudely done, compared to the rest of the 
building. Chutes and chimneys poke through the ceiling in a 
number of places, allowing ventilation for the room, and a 
spiderwebbing of ancient lead pipes crisscross above, most of 
them connected to the forge and ending at the western wall. 
   A surprisingly new trapdoor is tucked into the southeasten 
corner of the room, while battered wooden doors lead west and 
south. To the east, an open, somewhat crude doorway leads to 
another chamber.

A Well-Ventilated Foundry Against the Third Circle Wall~
   Blackened metal machinery lines the walls of this room, the 
western wall actually being that separating Minas Tirith's Second 
and Third Circles. All four granite walls are blackened with 
soot, as is the ceiling, which bears numerous thin slits for 
ventilation. Worn cauldrons, blackened vats, and ancient moulds 
alike litter the room in a thick, cluttered maze, serving only 
one purpose: to heat metal objects, melt them down, and reform 
them into a useable metal ingot.

   Quite unlike the rest of the building, this room seems to be 
more an afterthought than part of the original construction. The 
walls are made of stained oak rather than granite, and some of 
the planks appear to be in need of replacement. The floor is 
carpeted in some sort of gaudy, ancient shag that has faded from 
its original olive hue to a dull green with time. A path has 
been worn into the carpet from the western door to the bed.

   This workroom is large and spacious, allowing plenty of room 
for on-hand supply storage and workspace. Bolt holders for bolts 
of fabric line one of the richly-stained, pinewood walls while 
bins and built-in series of shelving line the others. Wooden 
mannequins of both male and female form stand in random areas on 
the floor, donning pinned bits and pieces of works-in-progress, 
or the occasional finished garment. A dry line is drawn from one 
wall to another on the far side of the room, allowing for dyed 
garments to drip down into a long wash-basin. A couple of tables 
and chairs and a workbench take up much of the remaining open 
space, but clear walkways are left to navigate the room with 
ease.

A Small and Orderly Kitchen~
   This kitchen is on the small side, but it is more than ample 
size to see food preparation and dining for a few people. The 
pine walls have been whitewashed to give the room a brighter, 
airier appearance, and a window over the wash basin lets natural 
light flood in, weather permitting. The shelves and furnishings 
are arranged neatly against the walls, well-organized to ensure 
cookery tools and necessities are within convenient, easy reach. 
Given the limited space, the room tends to get overwarm when the 
hearth or stove is in use, no matter the season.

A Wild Garden Before an Old Stone House~
   Plucked as if from some lonely wilderness, the garden here is 
wild and sprawling. Either through neglect or conscious design, 
the greenery runs rampant and unchecked, with great, overgrown 
rose bushes lining the walls that enclose the area, and lush, and 
uncut grasses stretching out from before the gate from whence one 
enters. A thread of order in a wild place, a wide cobbled 
walkway leads up from the arched gate towards the porch of an old 
stone house, held up by twin pillars of slender grey stone. In 
the center of the garden, half circles of backless marble benches 
encircle an ancient seeming statuette of a man bearing a large, 
shallow stone bowl. Like the statue before it, the porch itself 
is dressed in climbing and clinging vines, wild and free flowing, 
like all else in this green enclave.

An Expansive Hall~
   Dominating the large hall that occupies the central portion of 
the house, a large pool lies in the center, ringed in white 
marble, in contrast to the unrelieved grey of the stone masonry. 
Light and warmth emanates from a series of tall iron braziers 
that grace the walls at regular intervals. Otherwise 
unembellished, the walls hold home for a large hearth and three 
portraits. Within the pool itself, an indoor fountain of 
considerable size reaches almost to the ceiling. Scattered 
seemingly at random about the pool, a series of rugs, cushions 
and chairs make up the only seating to be found in the hall.

A Dank Chamber Below the House~
   A series of narrow, tightly spirally stairs lead into this 
small, damp, and dark chamber. The air here is wet and chilly, 
and no sound enters or leaves the cold stone that makes up the 
walls, roof and floor of this room. The stillness is disturbed 
by the occasional drop of water falling from above to the floor. 
Illumination is provided by a single torch set in its holder in 
the far wall, and an oppressive dimness permeates the chamber, 
with its only sign of life being a lone spiderweb lying still in 
the windless confines of the far corner. Ominously, a pair of 
shackles find themselves bolted to the eastern wall by short 
lengths of chain, the floor along that edge bearing a stain in 
red, either from rust or blood, it is now uncertain. A bronze 
plaque protrudes, featureless, from the wall beside the 
stairwell.

An Unusual Library~
   Occupying the back of the House, this square library is 
significantly smaller than the Hall that leads towards it, though 
by no means cramped. The walls are paneled in wood and the floor 
gleams with similar warmth. A large square rug, richly patterned 
in reds, golds and browns, covers most of the floorspace. Along 
the eastern wall, a large hearth provides warmth in the winters, 
while on the western end of the room a window looks out into the 
wild garden beyond, when uncovered by the velvet curtains that 
are placed about it. A series of sturdy teak bookshelves panel 
the wooden walls on either side of the single doorway, reaching 
around the room almost in its entirety. The central focus of 
the room, however, is the desk that sits directly opposite the 
doorway, and the unusual constructs that claim the wall 
immediately behind it. The wall behind the old wood desk is 
covered from floor to ceiling by blocklike glass enclosures, with 
spiders of various sizes spied within, some sitting silent and 
still, others scrambling frantically amid the tangled webs they 
have woven.

A Well Appointed Kitchen~
   Stretching along the eastern wall of the house, the kitchen 
bears a long counter, marble topped, several cabinets and a 
significantly sized stove and oven. Sturdy in construction, the 
room is utilitarian and unadorned, with ample lighting in the way 
of wall lamps and an open hearth that lies at the southern wall. 
Perhaps out of place, a small yet comfortable bed and side table 
can be found at the far end of the kitchen.

A Luxurious Bedroom~
   This large bedroom speaks eloquently of excess and perhaps 
even vanity. The entire affair is paneled in rich, dark wood, 
and carpeted in a cool shade of grey. To the left of the 
doorway, a large, canopied bed finds itself facing the west, 
whereas the entire wall of the northern end is devoted to housing 
a large and accessible wardrobe. A small table functions for a 
writing desk, and a basin with water finds itself in a corner. 
The entire room appears to be in a state of careless disarray, 
with clothes and personal items littering various surfaces in a 
haphazard manner.

A Thin, Narrow Alleyway~
   This narrow alley tapers off to the west, joining up with 
another small pathway. Houses rise up all around, their windows 
grimy and the walls in obvious states of disrepair. Trash 
litters the ground, the stench wafting up with harsh vigor. Up 
above, roofs meet sheltering the alley from excessive sunlight 
and poor weather. The alley continues to the east.

A Dank, Stench-Filled Alley~
   This alley run along a winding path between run-down houses, 
few windows visible and those which are present are too grimy to 
be seen through. The ground below is made up of dirt, pavement 
seeming to trail into a blind alley to the west. A single pile 
of trash rises up upon the southern wall, the smell of rotting 
foods wafting from it. The alley continues to the east and the 
roofs above come together to shelter the area from excessive 
sunlight or bad weather.

A Small Open Circle Amidst Rundown Houses~
   Alleyways branch off on all sides here, leading onwards 
between slum dwellings and formerly beatiful houses. This area 
appears to have at one time been a building, now fallen, to judge 
by the various pieces of rubble littered throughout the area. 
The exposed sky above gazes down upon this circle of space with a 
light eye, the dank and rotten smells of the area around 
channeling upwards here.

A Winding Alley~
   An opening in the alley appears to the north, the houses on 
either side halting in their tracks to allow room for the empty 
space before them. On either side, these slum dwellings seem to 
have at one time been solid buildings of white stone. Now, they 
lie in disrepair and neglect, grime marking their exterior. Rats 
scurry about underfoot, the vermin happily worming their way 
through the litter underfoot. Bisecting the alley to the south 
is a fence, beyond it lay a few sparse buildings. The sky above 
peeks through between roofs, and a small gap in the wall of 
houses ducks to the east.

A Small Gap Between Houses~
   This small space is about the size of half of the houses. It 
is empty, almost as if the builders of the city measured 
incorrectly and left an extra space. Some foundations have been 
laid upon the dirt below, but it seems as if nothing was ever 
made atop them. The eastern wall is rimmed around with a rare 
decoration, a ledge where flowers grow. A fence rises up to the 
ledge to the north, and to the west a solid stone wall without 
ornament stares jealously at its opposite.

A Thin Ledge~
   This thin ledge winds its precarious way around the stone wall 
of the dwelling here. It seems to go all the way around, laced 
with dirt and flowers. Nearby, it seems as if a network of 
cracks runs up the wall. Below, an empty space looms with rock 
foundations promising a painful landing if one should fall.

   This flat roof is made of hard stone, caked with years of 
grime. The air here is less pungent as below, and the sky above 
is easily visible. A barrier impeded access at one time to this 
roof, but now it lies in ruins, entire chunks of it simply gone. 
To the east an empty circle opens up, while to the north more 
rooftops can be seen. To the south, a gap is made between two 
roofs by the alley below. To the west, a drop into an empty 
space is visible.

A Turn in the Alley~
   The alley turns here, shifting towards the east. It curls 
around a building in a state of near collapse, the walls looking 
as if they are ready to drop at any moment. To the west and 
north houses rise up, decrepit and sad beneath their gloss of 
dirt and age-old grime. A few doors can be seen, leading into 
said houses, as they do in most of the other areas of the slum. 
The dirt ground below seems to have forgotten all notion of 
cleanliness or order, and is a winding way among seemingly 
permanent piles of litter.

A T-Intersection in the Slums~
   The alley curls around a building looking ready to collapse 
just to the west, its walls seeming as if the slightest pressure 
would make them collapse. A rusty old lamppost at one time 
provided light to this intersection but the alleys now split in 
decrepit bleakness. As one heads off northwards, so the other 
continues east and west. Trash is piled in a corner, against a 
shabby house.

A Squat Alleyway~
   This alleyway widens abruptly, the dirt ground below carrying 
wheel marks as if to mark the presence of wagons sometime in the 
past. Houses rise up, their tall faces squashed so that they 
seem like angry old men, glaring down at any passerby. The air 
above is visible, though it is redolent with the stench of the 
slums.

An Old Square~
   A fairly large square erupts in the midst of the slum 
dwellings here, an odd scar upon the otherwise uniform face of 
the Second Circle. The ground is full of dirt and weeds, in the 
midst of which rise vine-covered mounds. It almost seems as if 
the weeds have overtaken whatever was once beneath. All around, 
houses seem abandoned and a few bear char marks upon their walls. 
To the south, an alleyway beckons further into the maze of alleys 
that is the Second Circle slums.

A Dark Section of Alley~
   This stretch of the alley seems particularly dark, the 
probable cause the overhanging roofs which connect above. These 
protect from rain and sun, attached to two-story buildings which 
rise above the common level of shanties like islands in a sea. 
The ground below is an affair of dirt which seems dirtier than 
dirt could possibly be. The grime here is at a elevated level, 
even for the slums.

A Twist in the Alley~
   The alley twists here, the curve gentle like the arc of a bow. 
The houses seem to hold their walls closer to each other, 
huddling as if to protect from some giant threat. An oppressive 
silence generally hangs about this area as rooves come together 
above, forming almost an archway of sorts. The grimy dirt of 
this alley continues north and west.

An End to the Alley~
   The alley runs up for a bit, then ends here at a wall. It 
seems to have been placed recently, the mortar and grey bricks 
not yet filled with grime. Trash has been dumped all along its 
length as it runs from one run-down house to another. The dirt 
below is grimy, rats slinking their way through their natural 
territory without fear. The windows on the eastern building seem 
to have been boarded up, the doorway empty.

A Ramshackle House~
   This house was once a fairly nice place to live, the wide 
entryway tiled with stones, once a checkered black and white, now 
a uniform dust grey color. The walls are in a state of disrepair 
which promises danger, cracks running up to the surprisingly 
intact roof. Trash litters the barren floor, and a pair of old 
straw mats shows that inhabitants still occasionally use the 
place. A portrait, the picture worn by time, rats, mold and 
dust, still hangs precariously from the eastern wall. A door, 
whole and made of sturdy oak, rests in a well-made doorway to the 
north.

A Small Bedroom~
   A single door allows passage in and out of this room, set in

rest of this room, the oak door bears a metal lock below the 
knob. The entirety of this room is made up of grey stone, dusty 
and grimy yet still in good repair. A window, fairly large, 
rises upon the northern wall. Its grime-filled pane allows no 
vision through, and below it the rusty shell of what may have at 
one time been a bed rests.

A Trash-Ridden Alley~
   Walls encase this grimy alley in a valley of grey stone, 
running east and west. Roofs hang low upon the one-story 
buildings, more shacks than anything else. The dirt below is 
most often a slimy mud trail, a nauseating smell wafting from it. 
The smell is reminiscent of chamber pots and latrines. Upon the 
south wall, a pile of broken crates rises up to a grimy window 
set in the wall. Above, the sky is visible though the alley is 
quite dark during the night.

A Long, Narrow Path Between Buildings~
   This alley runs on to the east and west, its twisting and 
curving length passing by several buildings. One bears a door, 
boarded up, to the north. The slimy mud below seems to continue 
in both directions, smelling strongly of human waste and trash. 
The roofs above seem to have shrunk away from each other like two 
wary alley cats eyeing each other. The sky is visible above, 
darkening when night falls.

A Small Square~
   A single entry and exit into this small square lies to the 
east in the form of a small alleyway. All around, houses have 
been built around this square, and in fact square in the middle a 
square, grimy, crumbling foundation stone rises up from the 
slimey mud. The mud itself reeks of human waste and trash. This 
odor seems to originate from a grate near the foundation stone, 
where the most of the slimey mud seems to drip away.

On a Narrow Side Street~
   As the narrow side street continues, winding from the west 
where it eventually meets with Rath Celerdain, it becomes 
increasingly quiet. Few venture this far down the road, their 
steps usually solitary along the white cobblestones that line the 
street. Bordering it on either side are buildings made of 
varying materials--both wood and stone, most appearing to be 
private residences. A bell beside each door allows those passing 
to ring north or ring south to alert those within of the presence 
of someone outside.

A Cramped Storage Area~
   Wooden planks sanded smooth but left untreated make up the 
walls of this cramped storage area, barely enough room to move 
around. The roof slants downwards so that even a person of 
average height would need to crouch in order to fit. The floor 
is comprised of smooth cobblestones and a door to the west allows 
back out to the front of the stall. A tiny storage area holds a 
postbox, accessible to the east.

Within a Sturdy, Horse-Drawn Cart~
   The interior of this cart is bland and utilitarian, and the 
shape of it is that of a rough box, suggesting use for the 
transport of goods, rather then people. Constructed of sturdy 
oak planking bound by iron for strength and durability, it has 
been left open at the top. It is devoid of any seating, save the 
small bench towards the front, for a driver and perhaps a 
companion.

Within a Foyer~
   Within this immense foyer a polished, snow-white marble floor 
is drenched with gossamer clouds of colour which create a mirage 
in the likeness of a shifting, restless woodland. It originates 
from light streaming through carefully detailed stained-glass 
panes set into the ceiling. Fluted pillars stand watch besides 
the eastern doorway that leads to the courtyard. In their design 
they allow air from the outside to filter in through the smallest 
of gaps in the stone, each hole meticulously shaped to resemble a 
small bird. When a strong enough wind permits, it creates a 
hollow whistle not unlike a flutes deep notes. Hallways extends 
in each cardinal direction, but most prominantly, a long 
staircase winds its way upwards into the deeper parts of the 
building.

In a Stone-Walled Stable~
   White granite walls are choked in ranks of marigold and ivy 
nearby the hoof-shaped entrance that leads into this airy stable. 
Crushed earth and straw create the bedding for each of the ample 
stalls to which firm, dark-oaked stalldoors lead. The top of 
each door that expands to a waist-height has been frivolously 
engraved with herds of running horses which becomes smaller and 
smaller the further down it goes. A hayloft above rests upon a 
bed of snow-white granite, the thick slab keeping any of the hay 
from falling down into the area below. The belly of the slab 
that forms an overhanging rooftop to the stable bears a 
artistically embellished mural of a large, rearing horse isolated 
upon a hillside.

makeshift barracks; for though it does still contain a few horses 
in the stalls at its far back, much of the front of the barn has 
been cleared out and now houses bunks, equipment and several 
nicked and worn, old tables. There is little method to the 
chaotic organization of the bunks: they run down the length of 
either side of the barn and clutter much of its center 
floorspace. Always audible, even over the clamour of men and 
women working within the barn, is the sounds of the village 
outside, or the wilds beyond its walls.

Village Green Near the Northern Wall~
   This field, which sprouts out of the dusty village square to 
the south and meanders northwards until it reaches the wall, is 
more dirt than grass; packed hard in places but deceptively soft 
in others, making the terrain treacherous. A few hay targets 
have been set up against the northern battlements but otherwise 
it is quite barren and open.

A Few Colourful Stalls~
   Set up against the wooden wall of the battlements, several 
small stalls have been constructed and stream colourful banners 
or bits of cloth to attract the eye and, hopefully, the customer 
with it. A forge has been set up nearby, churning noxious fumes 
and smoke into the air while under the cover of a canvas tarp, a 
smith clanks iron against an anvil, reshaping horseshoes and 
hammer heads. Not too far from there a ferrier can be seen, 
cautiously working on horses made, more often than not, skittish, 
spooked by the forge-work nearby.

Near a Few Run-Down Stalls~
   Several stalls remain intact at the far back of the barn, 
though one to the east seems to have been converted into a 
holding cell. The smell of horses, manure and feed is stronger 
here than in the front of the barn, though mainly due to the fact 
that most of the supplies and horses are still stowed back here, 
along with an old wooden ladder, which leads up into the loft.

Straw-Strewn Barn Loft~
   The floor of this small loft has been strewn with straw and 
has a thick, musty smell in the best of weather. From here one 
can see to the north, and below, much of the barn and even go so 
far as to catch a glimpse of the dirt road outside. A wooden 
ladder leads down to the barn floor.

Stall Coverted into a Holding Cell~
   This stall has been converted rather hastily, but thoroughly, 
into a holding cell for prisoners. The floor has been swept 
clean of straw and is plain dirt, though a drip in the ceiling 
allows it to churn to mud in one corner, and the thin wall of the 
barn has been reinforced here several times over by thicker 
wooden planks, making a break-out unlikely. The wooden stall 
door has been rebuilt, taller and wider, and wire mesh, more 
commonly called chicken wire among the villagers, covers much of 
it, and stretches several feet past it, effectively cutting off 
the small stall from any unwanted outside influence.

   A splintered hole in the planks above lead down to this dank, 
dark tunnel. The dirt seems to have been excavated a long time 
ago, old and creaking supports holding up the whole thing. The 
ancient foundations of the building above can be seen at odd 
intervals, stabbing through the ground. The tunnel itself is not 
very wide, and leads onwards to the east.

   A gap in the western wall leads into a dark tunnel, the 
crumbled dirt and dust which litters the ground spreading

up from the ground here, numerous and built of heavy old stone. 
The area itself is fairly wide, and refuse litters it. A small

   Gazing west upon the open space, this alcove seems to have 
been made more by accident than by design. A pillar, probably 
one of the cornerstones of the structure above, rises in the 
middle of it. A few shelves, empty save for rat dung and litter, 
line the walls. It is very cramped, and the weight of the earth

   From here one can view Rath Daelond below, immediately to the 
east of the warehouse, and further to the east where it turns. 
To the north, the wall of the third circle looms high, the upper 
walls of the larger buildings along its edge visible if one 
cranes the neck at an extreme angle. To the south the flat roof 
of a building rises to just a few feet lower than this level. A 
metal trap door is set within a belfry in the southwestern

Rath Daelond is viewable, but only at the risk of ascending up 
this unsteady slope. Near its southern extent lie multiple large 
areas where the tiles have been replaced with very thin, fragile 
strips of wood joined with tar, making passage to the south 
impossible without falling through. A small courtyard lies below

A Dimly-Lit Stairwell~
   A rusty, iron spiral staircase winds upward from the 
ground-level landing, barely spacious enough for two men, toward 
a metal trap door fixed into a ceiling sloping westward at a 
forty-five degree angle -perhaps to prevent the inevitable deluge 
on rainy days. Despite this measure, this stairwell remains damp 
year-round, the metal steps dangerously slippery without the use 
of the handrails. A small, dimly-lit wall lamp provides a meager 
source of light. A faded tapestry is hung upon the eastern wall.

The sparse furniture present huddles at the western end. Brick 
walls, gaudilly decorated with several unevenly-dyed fraying 
tapestries, rise to almost twice a man's height where thick 
wooden support beams cross above. A wide archway allows access 
to the north where the aroma of cooking oil and spices wafts in. 
To the east stand windowless, iron-reinforced, swing-out barn

A Sparsely-Furnished Kitchen~
   Whoever designed this kitchen abandoned all but the minimum of 
furnishings in favor of extra space. Despite this precaution 
this small room allows standing room for a maximum or three or 
four individuals. A soot-black stove and cauldron stand at the 
northern wall, leaving space for multiple, warped pinewood 
shelves along the other walls. The pungent aroma of scorched 
firewood, cooking oil, dried herbs, and spices thinly veil a 
lingering rancid odor, its source a mystery. The footfalls of 
vermin, invisible in the dim lighting, seemingly echo from every 
direction.

has been made from the same, sturdy, granite blocks. The room 
itself is large and spacious with a high, vaulted ceiling and a 
rather large, wooden chandelier hanging from above in the center 
of the room. Many places around the study offer elongated desks 
and chairs though the main focus of the the area is the raised, 
circular platform situated at the back of the grand hall. Seats 
are set in a semi-circle surrounding the platform, offering 
anyone a good look at the smallish stage. 
   It is hustle and bustle within this study as many students and 
scholars go to and fro from the wide, double-doors to the west 
which leads into a reading room, or south to the front shop.

A Lot of Yellowed Grass and Broken Wood~
   This is a rather large lot, vaguely ovicular with the tips 
being on the eastern and western edges, the curves being to the 
north and south. It is filled with a harsh sort of yellowed 
grass nigh year around, and bits of broken wood and metal 
awaiting beneath the fauna and out of sight, waiting to trip the 
unwary. It seems that a raggedy shanty lies to the east, while 
paths lead north and south. Westwards, the lot meets the wall of 
the Second circle.

A Small Gardened Area before the Wall~
   This area, showing none of the unkempt wildness of the eastern 
one, is something of an oddity amidst the chaos and structural 
degredation of the first circle slums. At least one, if not 
more, knowledgable hand has been at work here, planting flowers 
and keeping them well tended, fostering a sense of beauty amongst 
the trashy surroundings. Small paths have even been laid through 
the carefully tended landscape, paved with bits of wood and other 
stones, but still lending an aura of properness.

Amidst the Wilderness of Shantytown~
   Departing from the openness of the southern way, this area is 
cramped and cluttered in the extreme. The footpath that roves 
between these closely-crammed shanties is wide enough for perhaps 
only two people to walk abreast without being shoved into any of 
the many shanties and hovels that cluster around this path. 
There is little to no organization of the crammed living spaces 
and, to the north, a cluster of them have sprouted, forcing the 
paths to fork east and west.

A Fork Amongst A Maze of Poverty~
   This path is narrow and winding, sometimes heading northwards, 
sometimes southwards, but holding to a generally easternly course 
as it weaves between the vile living conditions. During any sort 
of wet season, transversing this area would become just shy of a 
nightmare with the unpaved, dirt paths. Permanently surrounding 
the path as if seeking to envelope it are the shanties and hovels 
of the poverty-stricken.

Within a Festering Hovel~
   With a dirt floor and walls composed of cobbled-together iron 
and wood, it is obvious that whoever constructed this structure 
was a bit low in the building materials department. Despite 
this, it seems that this series of hovels is larger than it 
looks--the eastern wall contains a sort of low, narrow doorway 
that leads eastwards and into what seems to almost be a 
complex-esque group of areas. This area itself seems to focus as 
a sort of foyer of some sort, with little in the way of 
decoration.

A Filth-Ridden Common Area~
   This area seems to function as some sort of hub for the 
surrounding rooms, it being broader and more open than its 
counterparts. Poles are placed routinely througout the area in 
an attempt to keep the tin ceiling somewhat more stable and less 
likely to collapse upon the occupants. While the floor itself is 
still dirt, other small signs of attempts at civilization can be 
seen--a few rough, filthy rugs can be seen ground almost into the 
dirt and some sparse furnishings. Whenever the rain falls on the 
flat, square ceiling it would create a nigh insufferable 
cacophony.

A Room of Bug-Infested Sleeping Mats~
   This small area, at least, seems to have at least more care 
placed upon the flooring than in the others. A layer of thin tin 
has been laid over the floor that, while creating a din when 
walked over, helps to keep the place at least a little more dry 
and less of a mud pit. A plethora of sleeping mats, merely old, 
tattered blankets that have been pressed together with overuse, 
litter the area.

A Cobbled-Together Storage Area~
   Maintaining the decor of wood- and iron-composed walls, this 
area is vaguely square, and rather miniscule. It is perhaps some 
five feet long and, with the items that have been stuffed within 
it, looks rather cramped. Barrels and bins are scattered about 
here, most of them mud-speckled despite the layer of shattered 
wood and other such bits that have been hastily thrown across the 
floor to cut down on the thickness of the sticky mud.

Wandering Amongst Poor Hovels~
   This narrow dirt path weaves amongst these pitiful testaments 
to the economical status of those who live about here. Those who 
travel along it are given a first-hand view of the hollow-eyed 
persons who live there. The swaggering, already-scarred youths, 
and the almost physical pack mentality has settled over the area, 
obvious to any who might pass through. Rare it is indeed to see 
one person walking alone through this maze, but much more common 
to see groups of five and six, packed together for security as 
they shift their way through this urban wilderness.

A Courtyard to a Slums Compound~
   The makeshift barricade rises to the south, pieces of fallen 
mortar intermingled with old cabinets and even a bed, but the 
haphazard nature of its construction merely manages to conceal 
the rather orderly existence that has, sprung up here in this 
rather large compound. This area looks to have been cleaned up 
rather deliberately, mismatched flagstones lying atop the dirt. 
Several shacks - all neatly whitewashed - lie to the west. A 
large, ramshackle structure sits to the north, sounds of drinking 
and horseplay audible from within at any time of day. Several 
makeshift benches have been set around this courtyard, and 
against the eastern barricade is a small herb garden. Men 
dressed in slums clothing and armed with cudgels or other cheap 
weapons patrol the barricade day and night.

A Sprawling, Nameless, Ramshackle Tavern~
   The floor of this place is covered in sodden sawdust and pine 
chips, mixing the scent of ground wood with the less heady aromas 
of vomit, urine, and other foul smells. The main room of this 
tavern is absolutely cavernous, dark except for a few guttering 
torches suspended from rusting brackets, and filled at almost any 
time of day with men and women of a distinctly disreputable feel. 
The bar stretches along the northern wall, and there's an opening 
to the west that appears to be some sort of later addition. When 
it rains, water leaks through the roof in numerous places, and 
there are even a few holes significant enough to see daylight 
through. Still, the superstructure of the building seems 
relatively secure.

A Low-Ceilinged Fighting Ring~
   The ceiling here is both lower and sturdier than the main 
room's, and the coloration of the wood hints that this wing of 
the tavern was a later addition. Sawdust covers the floor here 
as well, the boards beneath it rough-hewn and cheap, occasionally 
still sticky with sap. In the center of the room, four stakes 
have been driven into the pine in a rough square, a length of 
hemp rope stretching around them to form a makeshift fighting 
ring. Long wooden benches take up the rest of the space here, 
with narrow avenues for people to move from one row to another.

A Velvet-Curtained Office With Plush Carpeting~
   The white flagstones that make up the whole floor of this 
spacious room have been covered by a plush carpet dyed a rich 
azure in color except for a small square around the entry door, 
where it has been left in view. Embroidered into the carpet 
itself is the Sindbar symbol in golden color, a sunburst with a 
falcon in flight. The stone walls have been hung with 
embroidered, velvet curtains that can be tied back to reveal the 
plain, silver sconces and a small bookshelf. By the entrance is 
a two-paned, broad window which looks out onto the street, framed 
by a set of thick, velvet curtains, azure in color. A 
modestly-sized fireplace sits nestled in a corner, invitingly 
surrounded by several comfortable-looking chairs. 
   An azure, velvet curtain with gold roping covers what can
be seen of a door set in the western wall while the top,
interior frame of the eastern door has been padded with
richly-tanned leather dyed azure in color.

   Several bunk beds line the walls of this spartan room. The 
walls are made from white flagstones while a deep azure rug is 
placed underfoot. A large window allows light to flood the room 
during the daytime, while its thick, embroidered curtain bars 
outside light from entering when needed. Soft illumination is 
provided by a lantern or two mounted against the walls, lighting 
this dormitory. Small chests stand tucked neatly underneath the 
footend of every bed, providing storage space for those who need 
it. The center of the room has been kept clear of all but a 
table and chairs, serving as a common area.

A Comfortable, Well-Lit Bedroom~
   Flagstones of well-cut white stones are fitted together 
perfectly to form this comfortable bedroom. The stones keep the 
room cool in the summer months while a small fireplace set in the 
eastern wall keeps the room warm in the winter, the metal piping 
of the fireplace concealed by the stones of the wall to disperse 
warm air throughout the building. Four sconces have been mounted 
onto the walls at all corners of the room, allowing this room 
plentiful illumination. 
   This room has a single window shaded by an embroidered, linen 
curtain and a sturdy, wooden door to the north leads straight 
into the office.

A Shabby Two-Room Warehouse~
   This two-room warehouse has been constructed some time ago, 
from raw-planed boards of pine. The ceiling, either as a result 
of age or shabby construction, leaks in a few places. No crates 
stack the walls, though the hefty rafters above bear evidence of 
old block-and-tackle equipment, testifying that at one point, 
this building was in service. The room itself is relatively 
small by warehouse standards, though still larger than most of 
the homes of the slums around it. Spots of mildew and woodrot 
are visible in the floorboards where water from the leaky ceiling 
has taken its toll. Two doors lead out, one opening northwards 
to the street and the other opening southwards into an office.

   The fresh scent of flowers fills this room, pervading from the 
stock that has been neatly displayed on shelves along the walls. 
Flowers of every size and shape imaginable keep watch over the 
store, light filtering in through two large windows set in the 
eastern wall, which flank a door which leads back onto the 
street. The floor is made of smooth pine, and looks to be 
meticulously kept clean, along with the rest of the shop.

A Small Backroom with a Slanting Ceiling~
   Set in the back of the warehouse, this room was obviously a 
later addition. There are no windows to let in the light, and 
only a simple lantern that hangs by the door. The walls and 
floor are cheap pine, and the ceiling is barely seven feet high 
at the lowest point, as it slants downward from the larger rooms 
rafters. Despite this, there is no evidence of any leaks, and 
the wood seems perfectly sound. There is perhaps room for a bed 
or for a desk, but not for both.

out into this hallway and a simple door sits in each of the

wall, directly ahead of the top of the staircase, bears a set of 
large glass doors, a roof terrace beyond visible through the

which rests a woolly rug of sapphire blue. Several furnishings 
are scattered throughout the room and a large window is set in 
the eastern wall, adjacent to another to allow ample lighting to 
filter in during the daytime. A wide, oaken door stained a deep 
umber is set in the southern wall and opposite, to the north, a 
smaller yet sturdy door leads into the office. An open archway 
to the east leads into the kitchen.

An Opulent Ballroom~
The soft lighting from the candles in the chandeliers make 
this spacious ballroom an inviting place for a dance. The 
opulent gilded mirrors lining the white paneled walls twinkle 
with reflected light, making it seem larger still. The vaulted 
ceiling is high and dark, giving the illusion that the room opens 
up to a quiet, dark evening sky. The highly polished inset maple 
floor shines, hinting at constant maintenance and care. The 
inviting strains of elegant music fill the air and more than one 
couple glides gracefully across the dance floor when an event is 
taking place. Against the western wall, several lush armchairs 
are grouped beside a few small tables, allowing observers to 
engage in intimate conversation.
    Elegant balconies overlook the ballroom to the north, south
and west, each accessed by an ornate, brass spiral stair.

A Spacious Banquet Hall~
   Vaulted ceilings rise high above the room. The walls are 
decorated with fine paintings in gold trimmed frames and velvet 
tapestries bearing the seal of each great house. Chandeliers are 
suspended over the center of the room and shimmer as the light 
passes through their crystals. Expensive-looking rugs in somber 
colors line the floor from east to west, creating a border from 
the grey marble beneath them.

A Large, Well-Kept Garden~
   A quaint path leads a winding trail through this meticulously 
groomed garden. Along the path, mirrored on each side are plants 
and flowers in contrasting colors. Lilies lead into roses and 
then to tulips. Daffodils announce their presence deeper into 
the yard while spruce trees tower above to offer an overhead 
covering of shade and protection from the elements. Suspended 
along the path are paper lanterns on string so thin, it offers 
the illusion of levitation.

north wall. Interspaced between them are portraits of great 
leaders and valiant battles painted by some of the most renowned 
painters from Minas Tirith history. Black marble tile frames the 
continuing lavish rugs that line the floor. Small pieces of 
furniture also have their place in the decoration of the room 
despite being placed in a way to blend rather than dominate.

A Massive Arena~
   Multiple sections of the yard are cordoned off with rope to 
isolate the separate event fields. The north is set apart for 
archery, with a large wooden board at its end to catch stray 
arrows. The south holds three separate rings for melee combat. 
The west side of the yard is set with a complicated obstacle 
course and is mirrored on the east with an open field to allow 
events of strength and speed. In the center of the yard is a 
long wooden beam to separate passing horses during the joust.

A Modestly-Sized Viewing Area~
   Rows of seating slowly rise from front to back facing an open 
courtyard. Built to stand higher than the arena itself, this 
viewing room provides a spectacular view of the games and 
contests to be held below. While not overly grand, the seats are 
designed with comfort in mind. Modest tapestries adorn the walls 
depicting scenes of combat and are yet placed to not be a 
distraction from the activities taking place below.

tools. Despite being designed of stained mahogany, this room was

A Spacious Dormitory Windowing A Garden~
   Blocks of white stone have skillfully been passed together 
with almost unmarkable joints. Unlike the hallway, this room 
lacks the panelling that covered the walls; the northern wall is 
slightly different in nuance then the rest. While not ornate, 
the high, arched ceiling, the masterful craftmanship, and the 
architecture hold a simple elegance. On the western wall is a 
window towards the garden, ivy framing it on the outside and 
sometimes creeping in over its vision. Another window is in the 
southern wall, providing more light. And from the ceiling hangs 
a brass lantern to illuminate the room during the dark hours. In 
the northern wall a solid door of polished oak seals of noise 
from outside.

A Rectangular-Shaped, High-Ceilinged Storage~
   This room is not very wide, but deep in length and the ceiling 
reaches high above. Set high in the back of the western wall, a 
small window lets in a meager amount of light through thick iron 
bars before stained glass. The walls are made of white, well- 
fitted stones, and are lined with shelves and boxes. In the back 
behind a modest, dark desk, a large banded chest stands fastened 
in on the floor. The only door stands to the east.

around the room. Underfoot is a pristine black carpet, still

   The ground here descends at a fairly steep grade while still 
providing sure footing for mounts. While the ceiling is not high

the largest war horse. Serviceable wall sconces line the walls 
leading up to a sturdy wooden gate. Small sewer grates at the

A One Room, Run-Down Abode~
   Stout walls of bleak grey stone mark the boundaries of this 
single room abode, a ceiling of rotting wooden beams rising 
overhead. The wooden floor underfoot is crooked and dusty and 
creaks noisily with every step. The windowless enclosure is 
usually dim or dark, and has no exits or entrances other than a 
narrow door resting on rusty hinges to the west. The furniture 
scattered about the room is in a state of disrepair, and appears 
to have been arranged rather haphazardly, as if the owner had 
halted suddenly in the midst of moving it. Cobwebs drift from 
the high corners of the dwelling, lending to its unsettling 
atmosphere of abandonment.

allow ample quantities of fresh air and light to stream through 
when open. A well-placed, glass lamp affixed to the wall 
provides soft lighting during the evening. The room has an airy 
feel and is roomy enough to accommodate a typical complement of 
bedroom furnishings. A square, argent-grey rug covers the 
floorboards and muffles the noise that filters up from the tavern 
below. A door set in the eastern wall provides egress into the 
sitting room.

placed not far from it. A glass-paned window set in the eastern 
wall allows light to filter in during the daytime though a 
strategically-placed glass sconce has been hung upon the walls to 
illuminate the room in the daytime. In the southern wall, a 
doorway has been set leading out into the hallway.

hangings of the finest silks and satins are immediately obvious 
upon entry. No less stunning are the statuary and paintings 
perfectly spaced throughout the room. Crystal chandeliers are 
suspended intermittently across the ceiling and provide most of 
the light for the room. In each corner is a small alcove for 
performers of different crafts or demonstrations. A massive 
depiction of the defense of Osgiliath is displayed in stained 
glass on the northern wall.

   A cobbled pathway leads through this beautifully tended garden

marble fountain. The path is framed with a lattice frame and 
decorative torches. The fountain itself is a scene with an 
aproned elderly man, sharing some form of instruction with a 
child surrounded by a round pool. No less impressive are the 
neatly groomed flowers and shrubbery artfully spaced throughout 
the garden.

with small flower beds surrounding each one. The immaculately 
manicured grass suggests that not many have chosen to leave the 
path aside from the groundskeepers. Small paper lanterns hang 
along the cobbled path, suspended from a barely visible wire.

trees. At almost random positions along the path are benches to 
provide rest for those that would prefer to admire their 
surroundings from a position of comfort. The benches are spaced 
far enough apart to provide intimate conversation without worry

about its business. To protect the spectators from wandering 
over the edge, a long marble railing has been erected on the 
western edge. The railing is carved with designs of mythical 
creatures and noble heros in various activities. Statues of 
legendary fellows adorn the balcony at both ends as if they're 
keeping a constant vigil over the city.

Near Rath Celerdain~
   At the outskirts of the great market, this section of the 
cobbled road narrows considerably between buildings. The stone 
walls are close together, with very little room left between 
them, and each seems to boast a shop of some sort. The traffic 
around is heavier to the west, though many continue on towards 
the east. A constant flurry of sound, this area is rarely quiet 
for longer than perhaps a moment or two as people pass through.

A Side Road Near Rath Celerdain~
   Flanked on either side by stone buildings, this section of the 
cobbled road is narrow and heavily-traversed, with those passing 
through increasing in concentration towards the western portion 
of the road. The great market is visible even from this point, 
the activity and noise penetrating this section of the city as 
well. Still, more than a small few continue on towards the east, 
where more shops and buildings are evident.

nonetheless are audible here as well. On three sides of the road 
are buildings, little room in between the stone walls. Underfoot 
are clean, well-kept looking cobblestones that line the entire 
area. The great walls of the city loom overhead, casting shadows 
that mingle with the light cast from the lamps posted nearby.

Cuddly Creatures and Critters~
   Within the stone walls of this shop, a few secure cages line 
the walls, often filled with kittens and puppies of different 
breeds. It's rarely quiet, as the creatures mew and bark each 
time the door swings open or closed, or someone ventures too 
closely. A long counter runs the length of the northern wall, a 
narrow door behind it opposite the southern one leading out onto 
the street.

An Outdoor Courtyard~
   This courtyard opens up off of the bustling plaza to the east, 
a rare space of relative repose in this merchant's ring of the 
White City. The flat and smooth white cobbles underfoot seem to 
be quite new, or at the very least much less traveled than the 
stones of city streets. A stone fountain of moderate size is 
centered in the sanctioned off area, surrounded by quaint benches 
on all four sides. The water trickling out of the spout adds an 
ambience to the air, but does little to mute the adjacent hustle 
of people passing by. Most of the greenery in the courtyard is 
confined to the edges and consists of low-maintenance hedges and 
rosebushes while ivy vines creep the wrought iron fences. A 
large building dominates the western side, casting shade and 
shadows over sections of the yard, dependant on the position of 
the moon or sun in the sky. The grand double doors leading into 
the structure, however, are to the south.

A Well-Ventilated Workshop~
   Taking up most of the bottom floor, this workshop is built 
from planks of wooden fitted lengthways and painted tan in 
colour, the floor similar planks of beech wood sanded smooth as 
silk. A shutter opens wide windows on both sides of the 
workshop, allowing both light and fresh air in, and a tight 
iron-wrought and beech spiral staircase is located near the 
storeroom at the back, leading upstairs to a neat little 
trapdoor. Every rack and bench is built from beech, well-made 
and solid, and under the tinge of lemon soap in the air lies the 
faintest scent of leather. It is relatively roomy, the light 
colours and spartan lines making it seem bigger than it is.

A Tiny Compartment~
   This cramped space between the floorboards is small, and 
though the boards are sturdy, they creak with any added weight 
upon them. When the boards above are closed, the area is 
shrouded in darkness; the only light is that which filters 
through the very narrow cracks between the wooden planks.

Rentir Brothers' Goods and Produce~
   Brightly lit, this storefront is filled with crates, shelves 
and stackouts displaying various produce and groceries. The 
yellow-stained wood walls are covered with shelves bearing 
products to be sold, firmly attached and solid, while the dark- 
red tiled floor is cut up into various aisles with the use of 
bins and stacks of goods. A rustic counter is set at the back of 
the room, in view of the front door, and has a solid door set 
behind it. An area of the room is cleared for heftier and larger 
items, a wooden platform rising the ground there slightly off the 
floor. A colourful awning covers the entrance from rain and 
leads back out of the shop.

darkly-stained oaken planks, bordered on each side by white stone 
walls, one of which contains a circular window, providing ample 
light during the day and a view of surrounding city. When 
natural night is not sufficient, simple glass lanterns hang upon 
the walls to provide additional illumination. A soft yet durable 
rug of rich grey tones covers the central area of the floor.

A Stone-Walled Storeroom~
   The walls and floor of this small storeroom are made up of 
well-cute, white flagstones perfectly-fitted together. Numerous 
shelves line the walls, filled with fabric in a chaos of colors 
and textures while crates have been stacked here and there, more 
bolts and folds of leather peeking out between the slats of their 
wood. There are no windows in this room, the only entrance or 
exit being the sturdy, oaken door set to the south.

A Bunk-Lined Dormitory~
   Like the rest of this building, this room is made of dark, 
well-cut stones. To illuminate the room, two large, shuttered 
windows have been built into the far wall and a few lanterns have 
been hung here and there from the ceiling. The room itself is 
rather spartan, beds lined up against one wall, matching chests 
on the foot of each. The other side of the room boasts a long 
table and chairs beside the sturdy shelving. 
   A door set in the western wall bears a bronze plaque engraved 
with two coins from which hang a pair of tassels while another 
door leads southwards into a private bedchamber.

A Rich-Green-Carpeted Bedroom~
   A rich green carpet has been spread across the floor of this 
moderately-sized bedroom, covering the whole of the stone 
flooring. The walls, however, have been left bare save for the 
glass lamps that have been affixed to the walls, allowing for 
plentiful illumination when lit. A small, stone fireplace in 
matching color has been built into the eastern wall and a wide 
window is set in the southern wall, its shutters the exact same 
shade as the carpet which adds subtle hints of masculine 
decoration to the room. 
   A heavy, wooden door leads north back out into the common 
area.

A Colorful Office With Glass-Stained Windows~
   This office is of moderate size, crimson-glazed tiles inlaid 
upon the floor in vibrant color. Smaller tiles in various shades 
of yellow from the lightest and pale, to the deepest, gold form a 
pattern upon the floor of Anor, the sun, just rising. The walls 
are panelled oak and rather bare though set here and there along 
them are wooden ledges upon which decorative vases are displayed. 
A few, glass lamps are set upon the walls to provide light and in 
the daytime, the stained-glass windows which flank the matching 
doorway allow colored light to shimmer in during the daytime. 
   The glass within the door leading back out to the street bears 
a sunrise design identical to that which is inlaid upon the floor 
tiles. The other doors leading north and east are of plain, 
sturdy wood.

A Small, Wooden Dormitory~
   The walls and floor are panelled in light-colored oak though 
the floorboards seem to be slightly scuffed, attesting to their 
age. The room is somewhat cramped with a set of two bunk-beds 
lining the walls and a small, round table centered between. 
There are no windows to this room, but plentiful light is given 
by the lanterns that are hung equally-spaced upon the walls. A 
door to the east leads into a private bedroom and the southern 
door leads back out into the office.

A Dusty Storeroom~
   The bottom half of this small storeroom is made of irregular, 
grey stones, built up to about an average-sized man's waist. The 
ceiling and remainder of the walls are the same oak panelling as 
the rest of the building. Crates and shelves line the walls, 
marked with sheafs of wheat or other symbols while some seem to 
leak sand. A smattering of crushed, glass shards crunch 
underfoot when you walk in and the room overall is rather dusty 
and dity. 
   This storeroom has no windows, only a single door that leads 
back into the office west.

sombre environment, a wooly rug has been spread across the floor 
in the center of the room and the walls have been painted a deep, 
crimson colour. A fine, oaken bed has been set up against the 
back wall of the room and at either side sit a small table and 
drawers. A small window and single, glass lamp provide light 
here, the room otherwise undecorated.

A Mahogany-Panelled, Marble-Floored Office~
   Perfectly-cut flagstones of green marble make up the floor of 
this moderately-sized office, little veins of grey and white 
streaking color here and there. Centered upon the floor, 
blue-gray marble has been inlaid to create the design of a large 
ocean wave, barely breaking with ocean mist spraying. A large, 
granite fireplace dominates one wall, a few small statues 
decorating its mantle in matching stone, their colors black and 
white. Other than this ostentatious display, the rest of the 
room is rather plain though well-built with mahogany wood 
panelling the walls. 
   Smaller doors of matching mahogany wood to the south and east 
lead further into the building while the door to the west leads 
back out onto the street

A Cramped, Bunk-Lined Dormitory~
   Despite the grandeur of the office beyond, this room is 
spartan in comparison and very cramped. The room is built in a 
long, rectangular shape, the first half of the room giving only 
enough room down a center aisle to walk through with bunks lining 
either side. At the far end of the room where a single window 
has been set into the wall, a small table and chairs serve as a 
common area. The room is well-lit with glass lamps 
intermittently hung upon the walls but overall, the room is 
rather bare.

An Emerald-Green-Painted Bedroom~
   Like the rest of the building, the walls are made of fine, 
mahogany wooden panells though they have been painted a rich 
shade of emerald green with simple molding in a soft blue shade 
that runs across the tops and botoms of the walls, their colors 
complementing the dark wood of the flooring. The rug spread out 
at the foot of the fine, oak bed is soft and wooly, dyed to match 
the shade of the walls. A single, curtained window allows fresh 
air and light to stream in through the day and a glass lamp 
affixed to the wall beside the northern doorway provides 
illumination for the nights.

A Small, Windowless Storeroom~
   The whole of this room is made of well-cut stone blocks 
tightly-fitted together for security. Crates, bins, and shelving 
line all walls though the farthest, back corner of the room 
houses an iron-bound strongbox where valuables are kept. There 
are no windows but ample lighting is provided by the numerous 
lanterns hung intermittently upon the walls. Because of its 
small size, this room is rather cramped, leaving one to have to 
climb over housed goods to fully enter.

of voices and creaking of floorboards can occasionally be heard

upon the wood and the granite fireplace that dominates one corner 
is nearly pristine. The room, large as it is, is divided with 
one side housing the oak bed and armoire while the other serves 
as a study. The shelving here is unique, recesses built into the 
walls with matching mahogany-wood panelling so that it allows 
more floor space while a few glass sconces have been affixed here 
and there to provide ample lighting.

A Hidden Chamber Behind a Bookshelf~
   Granite stone make up the walls and floor of this small, 
private room hidden behind the rather large bookcase that makes 
up the eastern wall. It is rather musty in here with no windows 
though two glas lamps have been affixed to the walls to 
illuminate the chamber. The room itself is rather small, only a 
table and bookshelf furnishing it. 
   There is a small lever set into the eastern wall beside the 
bookcase.

Inside the Gazebo~
   Vines climb the boards holding the banisters in place of this 
small, intimate gazebo, providing a rather romantic and idyllic 
atmosphere. Surrounding the roof and banisters are tiny scenes 
of crafters at work in their workshops, each Fellowship 
represented at least once. A few benches line the inside of the 
gazebo along the edge as well as along the outside, providing for 
private conversation, or just a relaxing view of the garden.

A Wide, Bunk-Lined Dormitory~
   Spacious and well-kept, this dormitory can likely house a 
half-dozen or more people at any given time. Several beds have 
been arrayed against the northern wall, evenly spaced from one 
another and well-made. Shelves and tables, as well as other 
furnishings, dot the room, but otherwise it seems to be fairly 
well-kept.

The End of a Hallway~
   Dimly lit but well-kept, this hallway comes to an end here, 
blocked in on three sides by large, solid doors. Engraved gold 
plaques identify the rooms on the western and eastern sides, but 
the southern door is empty of decoration or any such plaques. 
The hall continues northwards, leading to more offices and the 
exit from this hallway.

A Condemned Shopfront~
   This shopfront clearly has not been used in some time - dust 
and cobwebs line the decaying shelves, and some of the 
floorboards are rotted - one has even collapsed entirely, 
creating a hazard to those who walk here. A pockmarked counter 
spans the width of the shop, and a battered door leads 
southwards, further into the shop.

The Workroom of a Collapsing Shop~
   This workroom is as decrypted as the rest of the building, the 
floorboards creaking underfoot and rotting from within. Doors to 
the east, south and west once led to the rest of this shop, but 
now only collapsed ruins can be seen through these passageways. 
Towards the southern end of this workroom, the ceiling sags 
heavily, and the small, glass windows framed in the walls of the 
building are mostly shattered.
