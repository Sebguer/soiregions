lantern rusted iron heavy METAL~
a heavy, rusted-iron lantern~
a heavy, rusted-iron lantern lies here, discarded~
   Fashioned of sturdy iron, this lantern is bulky and cumbersome.  
It is of a simple rectangular design and has become rusted with 
age.  The small panes of glass that would have once encased the 
flame are no longer present, but the lantern can easily be carried
with the large circular handle that attaches to the lantern's body.

a well-worn pair of faded-green leather rerebraces~
A well-worn pair of faded-green leather rerebraces lie here.~
   Crafted from thick leather of a fine quality, these rerebraces 
have obviously been worn-in and put to good use. The leather has 
been dyed green and faded with use, though the original darker 
color can be spotted in the wrinkles and folds. Two tubes of 
thick leather cover the wearer from the upper arms to the elbows, 
where articulated couters have been stitched. Regardless of the 
worn-out look, these pieces of armor appear extremely effective 
and sturdy enough to protect the wearer well.

a small ball of luminescent flesh~
A round and small ball of flesh lies here glowing weakly.~
   No bigger then it could be hidden in the palm of a young boy, 
this ball of white-hued flesh is lit by an inner glow. Light is 
spread from it weakly, but enough to cast a soft luminescence 
across a smaller area. Enough to find ones way, but not to read 
a parchment or a book comfortably. The removed organ is somewhat 
slimly and warm to touch, the smell reminiscent of gutted fish.

A group of carelessly stacked boulders form the shape of a spontaneous fort or dwelling here.~
   Some large boulders put together by chance, nature or giant 
hands form a disorderly stack. Where they lean against 
each-other is formed a crude fort or dwelling by the dark-grey 
rock - and there are signs of life here with scrawling cut on the 
stones, perhaps marks made to indicate the passage of time. At a 
few places the dwelling have large gaping jaws that leads inside 
there have burned fires long ago, large patches of moist soot and 
blackened rock tells a unmistakably simple tale.

A sparse collection of bones and debris.~
   Shattered across the shore are pieces of bone, fragments of 
metal, bones in abundance and some pieces of wood. Where these 
abandoned bits come from is a mystery, but somewhere this vast 
underground lake must be connected to the warm and sun-lit world 
of the surface. Perhaps it would be possible to gather flotsam 
in order to get some materials or some fire-wood in order to stay 
alive down here.

an ancient, ornamented longsword~
An heavy longsword of ancient origins carrying worn-down ornamentation lies here.~
   This sword is made up of a long and heavy blade, well-balanced 
and forged from high-quality steel. The cross-guard and pommel 
in bronze, the handle set with rough leather. None of the other 
pieces are clearly of the same origin as the blade itself, it's 
been scarred and sharpened over and over again over multiple 
decades of use while the other pieces are freshly set. The 
ornamentation on the blade have become faded by use and age. Its 
barely possible to make out the symbol of a tree with stars, a 
crown above it and some crossed tools laid over the middle.

A fortification manned by black-bloods is set on the beach here to hold it as a stepping-stone for moving further into the western lands.~
   This beach-head is a rugged improvisation made from broken 
down palisades, boats being lifted ashore and using any building 
material available - in this case mostly the corpses of men and 
black-blood alike. The disgusting and shoddy work is 
nevertheless effective as a defence against counter-attacks.

A thoroughly rusty pickaxe head is lodged halfway into a nearby wall.~
   This long, pointy piece of iron is lodged deep in the tunnel 
wall, heavily pitted and completely covered in rust. Several 
narrow cracks run along the stone, radiating outwards from it. 
The barest remnants of a wooden handle, little more than rotten 
splinters, are still visible where it meets the metal base of the 
pickaxe head.

wall, the other end against the floor; it is slanted rather than 
straight, its original position evident from the large gouge in 
the ceiling. Parts of it of it have rotted away over time, 
leaving jagged holes all along its length.

   The wall seems to be marked with some sort of angular design, 
its thick, blue-black lines drawn directly onto the stone. 
Whatever ink or chalk was used to create the strange symbol, it 
seems to be quite resistant to weathering; most of it is still 
intact, despite a great deal of smearing around the edges.

   These broken pieces of wood and rust-encrusted bits of metal 
might have, at some point, been tools or spare parts, though now 
their purpose can only be guessed at. Most are too pitted and 
worn by time to tell their original form, let alone their 
function. The relatively straight edges and regular shapes in 
the pile indicate that many of them were probably same thing.

been here for quite some time. It is half-buried under a pile of 
rubble, the broken stones having crushed it long ago. Its wheels 
are barely recognizable, and the interior is filled in entirely 
with rock and other debris. It seems unlikely that the vehicle 
will ever be usable again, not to mention that freeing it would 
almost certainly take a monumental effort.

the load be light enough. Rents and gashes mar the iron that forms
the basket and the ancient ropes are partially frayed.  Still, this
basket looks it could serve its purpose albeit in an adventurous
fashion.

skeleton. The skull is covered in large cracks and has a jagged 
hole on its left side. Most of its teeth have fallen out, and 
nothing remains of the flesh, though some brown and decayed bits 
of clothing still cling to the figure. All of the ribs appear to 
have been pushed in toward the spine, the splintered segments

loose threads and numerous holes preventing it from ever being

these boots are little more than formless bags that terminate
half way up the wearer's calves. While heavy stitches were used
in their making, they are undoubtedly kept together by the tough
strips of leather that are wrapped all about each of them. A pair
of buckles on each boot holds these strips of leather into place. 
Upon each of these boots a series of vicious spikes have been
added, allowing for a formidable set of functionable footwear.

In the construction of these gloves, spikes of iron have been
put into place in key locations upon these gloves. Being in the

   Thick pelts of treated fur have been stitched together into
a double-layered vest to offer protection from the elements as 
well as from enemies, though the latter is mediocre at best. The
stitch work is plainly visible in places and work of someone who
is barely acceptable at best. The only thing seeming to keep 
this vest together is a series of belts that criss-cross back 
and forth over this vest before looping around the waist. Set 
in rows and roughly two fingers apart, iron spikes have been 
driven through the leather vest, allowing for extra protection.

#1A dark inferno rises from the depths of the stone fire-pit.#0~
The massive inferno gives off powerful waves of heat.  It would shed far more illumination throughout the cavern if not for the blackness that rose from within.  A massive pillar of black fumes surges upwards, produced by whatever fuels the conflagration.  The fire-pit is crude, but a noteworthy feat due to its vastness.  A grown troll would be unable to climb out from its depths, and it could fit twenty of such.  Despite its immensity, the flames tower above the heads of all onlookers, meaning they rise at least twenty feet in height.  One need not be in close proximity to smell the putrid odor the burning fuel gives off, something only the darkest of breeds could abide with ease.

   Diminished in greatness, far less than its highest potential, 
the flames of the fire-pit presently amount to naught but a 
blanket of embers covering the floor of the hollowed out hole. 
They glitter with an anger that tells of immense heat that could 
still immolate anything placed within their reach, but if left 
without fuel, sure to die in less than two days.

A bowl of thick, acrid stew sits here.~
   Served in a roughly carved stone bowl, this stew is thick and 
has the unmistakable aroma of blood. Upon closer examination, a 
few pieces of stringy, red meat can be seen floating throughout 
the dark red liquid. To add to the sickening concoction, 
assorted pieces of rubbery animal hide and fur can also be seen 
within the stew, but to a much less quantity than the meat.

tribal war drums collection OTHER~
a collection of tribal war-drums~
A collection of tribal war-drums of various sizes are lashed together, occupying much of the space here.~
   Lashed together so as to become one unit, the collection of 
percussion instruments is comprised of over a dozen pieces. They 
are all designed in like fashion, a crudely shaped shell with 
some manner of skin tautly stretched over both ends that, when 
struck, produces a deep resonance. Seemingly crude, they are 
very durable and unlikely to be damaged in proper use. Arranged 
in a crescent line from smallest to largest, the first of the 
drums are no larger than a human head, and are apt to be played 
for a quicker, less forceful rhythm, where as its largest 
counterpart is rivals a full-grown troll in size, and must likely 
be played by no less than that. There are three of these 
gargantuan pieces, and when struck, their thunderous 
reverberations would likely be heard for miles around. 
Accompanying the set are "drum-sticks" of sufficient size for the 
variously proportioned instruments, though they seem to be 
nothing more than bones ranging from human to troll in kind.

Dwarvish origin: short and quite stocky, with thick bones and 
broad hands. Aside from the apparent degradation from time, the 
skull of this ancient deceased dwarf has been cloven down the

A shiny brass instrument of rotating discs rests here.~
   One need but look at it to deduce that it the product of a 
mind far beyond the mere realm of cunning. The brass instrument 
maintains a glossy polish, pristine enough that it catches small 
reflections on its surface. Shaped like a rod, its dimensions 
are small, as long as a man's hand with a diameter no greater 
than that of a walnut, making it unusually heavy for its size. 
It is not a single piece, rather ten discs that rotate freely 
around some unseen core and etched upon these are minute numerals 
that only one learned in Angerthas-Moria could interpret. On one 
end of the rod is an aperture of indeterminate depth, perhaps 
where something is meant to be inserted, and on the other are a 
four square "loops" that a mans fingers could fit through.

   Crafted from thick leather of a fine quality, these greaves 
have obviously been worn-in and put to good use. The leather has 
been dyed green and faded with use, though the original darker 
color can be spotted in the wrinkles and folds. Connected at the 
top by only a cord, two tubes of thick leather cover the wearer 
from the upper thighs to the knees, where articulated poleyns 
have been stitched, and down to the shins. Regardless of the 
worn-out look, these pieces of armor appear extremely effective 
and sturdy enough to protect the wearer well.

A deep fire-pit has been carved out of the ground here.~
   Sitting in the very center of the cavern, the fire-pit is the 
most unnatural thing to be seen here. It was no slapstick 
endeavor either, made apparent by the fact that it is so vast. 
The bed of ash is far enough down that a grown troll would be 
hard pressed to find a way out from the bottom. Perhaps twenty 
feet in diameter, the pit does not occupy a vast space in the 
underground vault, but certainly occupies the time of 
simple-minded goblins with a draw to fire. Presently it is 
unlit, and to kindle a flame worthy of so great a fire-pit would 
require a large supply of fuel.

blackened to set further contrast to the word.

an enormous curving blade~
An enormous curving blade has been left here.~
   This curving blade is almost six feet long, blunted in the 
center and sharpened on both ends. The metal is thick and sturdy 
though unadorned. Running the length of the blade is a gutter 
which adds to its overall strength.

this greave is several hand spans long. Black corrosion has

Dropped and forgotten, this worn-out chest plate lies here upon the ground.~
   Evidence of several heavy blows distort the faux musculature 
design and a rent, at least a hand span wide, has pierced the 
center of this chest piece. It appears to have been forged for 
an individual of particularly broad torso. Any joints have fused 
solid and corrosion obscures the interior and exterior surfaces.

discolored mass that threatens to disintegrate when ever 
manipulated.

   A single seam, folded over on itself, reinforced by rivets, 
runs down the front of this conical helmet and offers a crude 
aesthetic to the otherwise unadorned helm. In contrast to the 
basic front the back of the head and the cheek guards look to 
have been hammered to contour precisely the wearer. The metal 
looks to have been compromised by the elements and the passage of 
time.

   This axe is made solely of iron, both shaft and head. The 
head is rather square in appearance, not having so much the usual 
rounded edge as is common with axes. However the straight edge 
looks keen, the several small nicks indicating it has been well 
used but nonetheless a keen edge. There is no spike or any other 
piece on the single-edged, solid axe blade. The iron itself is 
dull grey, old, even with little hints of rust at places but 
despite this it lays heavy in its wielder's hand. A thin but 
strong length of leather has been wrapped around the iron shaft 
to work as a handle and beneath it sits a heavy square piece of 
once highly polished metal for counterweight.

   This hauberk is definitely on the heavier side. However each 
scale seems meticulously crafted although somewhat square in 
shape. Over the shoulders and moving a bit down the upper arms 
are massive, thick iron spaulders, also somewhat square in shape. 
The hauberk itself is very well made and the iron must be of the 
finest quality. However it does not seem to have been used for a 
while as little dots of rust have started to creep onto some of 
the hard iron scales.

intact, even though it has been lightly smoothened and shaped. 
The seat is wide, carefully carved and flattened to provide some 
comfort. Its solid back is wide and very tall, rough, pointy 
corners giving it a threatening appearance. The large armrests 
and back are covered in various feral animal carvings.

The single edge appears sharpened in a hurry, though it is 
wickedly sharp. The hilt is spartan, and efficient at its sole 
purpose-- to keep the blade off of the hand. A crudely-shaped 
iron pommel is attached to the end, for balance. Overall, the 
sword is crudely molded and hammered, cumbersome but deadly.

loincloth seems thick enough to actually provide some protection, 
as long as the wearers bared legs are not hit.

   A thick iron bulb set on top of a wild-elm haft, this mace has

the haft are weak and rattle loosely when disturbed. Although 
his crude made appears to be almost utterly useless, it would

dyed a muddy brown in color.

Ten cruel looking barbs of iron protrude viciously from the

it's exterior and also ensuring a firm grip. A length of sinew 
droops lifelessly from the butt end of the handle - the length 
capable of being slung over the shoulder or hooked to a belt.

   Built of two main components, a broad chest-piece and a 
back-plate - this sturdy iron shell appears to have served a 
healthy life of battle. The front is marred with scratches and 
dents, while the back appears quite untouched and in prime 
condition. Strategically placed straps secure this piece of 
armor to the torso, imprisoning its wearer into a box of metal. 
Two banded pauldrons sit high at the shoulder, their surfaces on 
close inspection etched with ancient sigils which curl and swirl 
in unique patterns.

It has been designed to sit high on hips at the waist in a sturdy 
fashion. Two primary flaps, one in the front and one in the 
back, along with strips of various lengths hang down over the 
wearer's tender bits. It provides rudimentary protection to the 
groin and buttock.

head rope human ORKISH suspended segment byKarkus LEATHER~
a human head, suspended by a segment of rope~
A head on a rope has been abandoned here.~
   Heavily deteriorated through time and weathering, upon this 
head remains little of the pale flesh which once clinged to its 
skull. From its appearance it would seem to be the head of a 
young woman, who was decapitated just above the shoulders. Eyes 
long missing, they have been replaced with a pair of blue-tinted 
river stones, which have been rammed into place, apparently by a 
hammer's strike. This has caused more than a few small cracks to 
etch their way from the eye sockets and onto the main skull from 
the extremely snug fit. Some patches of obsidian-black hair 
remain upon the head, which has been delicately braided in all of 
its length, and tied off at the end. The jaws of this head are 
loosely secured to the skull by a series of bolts, which still 
allow the jaw movement, while retaining its place upon the head. 
Some of the teeth within the mouth of the disembodied person have 
gone long missing, apparent signs of tooth decay upon the 
remaining teeth. Two puncture holes are evident upon the skull, 
allowing a segment of rope to be strung through, and secured to 
the body of the wearer. While showing a lack of skill in its 
construction, it would seem that the maker of this trophy has 
taken considerable care of the head.

   Forged of darkened iron, this greathelm holds a dreadful 
visage. Small, arched spikes ascend from the crown at multiple 
points. Standing taller than these are four cruelly-sharp 
blades, and a fifth, centered above the forehead, that towers 
highest of all. From the angular eye-slits downward, the helm is 
shaped like a pair of grasping boney claws with only a small 
opening that exposes the wearer's lips between the grasping 
talons. The iron descends towards the wearer's throat before 
tapering to a pair of sharp points, protecting the jaw and neck 
from attack.

a black, recurved falchion with a hand-molded pommel~
A recurved falchion rests here, pommel molded to the shape of a hand.~
   Crafted from crude iron, this falchion has been thickened and 
blackened in fire. The tip of the blade is wickedly sharp, 
arcing down with the same razor edge along it's blades complete 
length. The handle has been wrapped in a cloth-like materials, 
curled around and studded with iron rivets. The pommel, 
blackened, is a skeletal hand, curling up over a pommel, 
clenching it within its deathly grip.

an old, vandalized dwarven statue~
An old, vandalized dwarven statue has been set in stone, fixed to the wall.~
   This old, scratched up statue rests with an eerie ease. The 
statue, the carving of a dwarf, perhaps someone of relative 
importance stands with his hands planted firmly on his hips. His 
body, which was once defined in armor has been torn up, and 
vandalized. Deep, jutting cracks run down his face and neck, 
almost as if someone had attempt to tear it off. His boots are 
untouched, firmly planted on the ground.

A cavity in the rock is set in the wall here.~
   A simple hole dug into the rock allows items to be stored 
inside. The sides and bottom are uneven, but the cavity widens 
somewhat beyond its mouth, preventing the contents from rolling 
out. While fairly roomy, the smaller opening is less obvious and 
could easily be concealed.

a light, flexible bone shortbow~
A flexible length of bone lies here, strung with tight sinew.~
   Crafted from a length of flexible bone, this shortbow is 
utterly rudimentary and unimpressive to behold, but nonetheless 
appears to be quite effective and skillfully made. Treated with 
some unknown substance to retain its pliable quality, the smooth 
bone is yellowed with age and use. A long strip of leather has 
been wound repeatedly around the middle of the shaft to aid the 
grip, and it is strung with a length of taut intestine. The bow 
is extremely light.

A craggy stone cudgel rests here, wrapped in dingy leather.~
   A naturally cone-shaped length of stone has been wrapped with 
leather at one end to serve as a bludgeoning weapon. The surface 
is craggy and uneven, and the sheer weight of the thick weapon is 
enough to inflict significant damage. Such use has left it 
chipped and worn in places.

   A shaft of bone has been honed straight and relatively smooth, 
providing a short but effective arrow. Wedged into a notch in 
one end and lashed firmly in place is a sharp, pointed shard of 
flint, and the fletching is a small, grey feather. Due to its 
length, the arrow likely only suitable to nock on a shortbow.

along one side, giving it a reasonable cutting edge. Shaped not 
unlike a small scimitar, the implement is very light and easy to 
carry, suitable both as a weapon and a tool for as long as the 
edge will hold. A third of its length is wrapped in hide to 
provide a secure grip.

   Matte grey pewter has been shaped into a round canteen, 
perfectly round and flat in the shape of a thick wheel. The 
material is dented and scratched but retains its general shape 
and staunchness, and a long leather strap allows it to be slung 
over a shoulder or onto the back. The mouth is stoppered with a 
bit of wood.

   A wide section of soft, worn leather has been sewn into a 
gorget-shaped piece of apparel, donned over the head to lay 
across the neck and upper chest of the wearer. Sewn into the 
leather are overlapping pieces of flat bone, providing the main 
protection of this armor, with the leather backing serving only 
as a measure of comfort between the body and the coarse bone 
plates. Many of the plates are scratched or broken in half, and 
a few are missing entirely.

sharpened on both sides of the blade. The dagger has been 
treated with fire to strengthen the material, leaving it a 
smudged greyish-black hue, and the hilt is a simple extension of 
the same piece wrapped in leather cord for a secure grip. It is 
without guard or pommel.

tapering bone spearhead. The bone is fairly sharp and has been 
fire-hardened to add strength and durability, leaving it a sooty 
black color. The wooden shaft appears to be rather old, but it 
is in decent shape and somewhat heavy. Leather has been wound 
around it in two places, ensuring a firm grip.

A sharpened length of bone lies here.~
   A section of bone approximately the size of a human femur has 
been sanded and sharpened into something resembling a shortsword. 
The double-edged blade does not taper into a point but comes to 
an abrupt end where the natural shape of the bone is swept 
backwards into a spike. The opposite end is shaven into a plain 
hilt. Wholly undecorated, this weapon is rudimentary and 
primitive in the extreme, but could inflict significant damage 
nonetheless.

An old, rusting pickaxe sits on its head here.~
   Seemingly archaic, this mining implement has seen extensive 
use and has doubtlessly outlived its owner. The greyish wood of 
its haft is worn smooth in places and porously brittle in others. 
A sturdy iron head has been affixed to the top, one end sharpened 
at its faintly curving tip and the other flaring into a flat, 
shovel-like blade. The metal is rusted and tarnished, but it 
would still function as a mining tool or even a weapon.

smoothed, by wear or finish, and the bone is yellowed with age. 
Leather has been wrapped around the bottom third, fraying in 
places. The shape of the piece, with the bulbous stump at the 
thicker end, gives it a general club shape and could easily be 
used as such.

A petrified forest stretches here.~
   What must have been a forest of lush trees now stands 
petrified and dead, filling the area with gloomy, fragile boughs 
of mineralized lengths. The trees stand solid in their frozen 
state, rooted to the ground with roots that are more rock than 
anything else. The bark has fused to the trees and does not 
offer any sort of substrate for life. Despite this condition, it 
is possible that someone might find branches and pieces that, 
with some coaxing, might be used for fire.

a massive, hard-oak and iron-banded shield~
A massive, hard-oak and iron-banded shield lies here.~
   This massive shield is rather misshapped upon sight, and oddly 
enough holds the figure of a door; with a flat bottom side and a 
pair of curved lines protruding downward and tapering to meet at 
the top with a broad point. The once-door, now-shield has been 
turned upside down and fastened with swathes of corroding iron 
links, some of the binding has been hastefully covered with thin 
strips of animal fur in an attempt for added comfort. The shield 
is created from thick slabs of hard oak, which are banded 
together by broad slabs of iron, those held together by deeply 
planted iron bolts. This shield, which of a rather odd make, 
seems to bee a relatively effective transformation into a 
serviceable piece of armor, though it would only do good for 
somebody of gigantic proportion and strength.

   Made from splintered planks of weed, this square shield 
supports itself by several riveted iron strips which run across 
its forward facing surface. A back strap has also been fixed for

the shield's front, a crude black hand has been painted on - 
fingers curling into a sharp claws.

a scaffold-ringed construction site~
At the start of the bridge, is a scaffold-ringed construction site.~
   With a great pile of stone blocks beside it, this construction 
site is definatly orkish in orgin. Crudely assembled scaffolding 
allows the construction of walls to almost limitless height, 
while an assortment of pulleys and small cranes allow the haulage 
of materials. Dust hangs in a choking cloud around the site, and 
the incessent banging of stone hammers fills the air.

OTHER fort stone orkish xxFORTxx~
a squat, spike-covered fort~
Blocking the end of the bridge is a squat, spike-covered fort.~
   Made from a heavy, dark stone, this squat fort blocks the 
western end of the bridge. It is perhaps twenty feet high at 
it's tallest point, the walls seemingly thick and well built. 
Orkish in design, the builders have spared no thought for 
asthetics, and it is dark and ugly, the stone roughly cut and 
left with abrasive, jagged surfaces. A thick gate wrought of 
rusty iron bars the way off the bridge, and as it is built right 
to the edge of the chasm, makes it impossible for one to try and 
walk around. The gate opens outwards and upwards, rising until 
it lays flat, drawn up by thick chains when attatched.

An exquisite, gem-inlaid steel axe lies here.~
   Thick leather cords are intertwined about the realtively stout 
lumber handle of this weapon, each knot and twist adding into a 
magnificent culmination of flowing design cast in grays, blacks, 
and deep reds. Set upon the bottom of the shaft and acting as a 
cap is an eight-edged metal spike, carved at the top with 
finely-engraved markings before tapering down into a vicious 
point. Its head is inlaid upon the sides with gems of deep blues 
and greens, each chiseled expertly in between lines of single 
sigils, its long edge arc'd in a shining steel half-crescent, a 
curved spike cropping of behind its back.

A crude iron hauberk engraved with an ashen ring has been set here.~
   This leather-backed hauberk fits over the chest and back, 
strapping on the sides with thick buckles. Chunky iron plates, 
roughly beaten into wide strips, have been riveted in place to 
add protection, but the workmanship is quick. The plates rattle 
when worn, scraping against each other and making a generally 
irritating racket. Crudely etched into the center of this chest 
piece of a circle design - and filling that design is a hard, 
ashen paste.

the fingers, allowing a grasping motion but little else. They 
strap securely at the wrists with buckles.
