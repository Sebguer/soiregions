Uilos pearl white long eared stallion POFHAL_WARHORSE~
a pearl-white-coated, long-eared stallion~
A pearl-white-coated, long-eared stallion tosses his head.~
   This heavily-muscled, sleek pearl-white-coated stallion has 
dark luminous eyes, often half hidden by his long,thick forelock. 
The hair around his muzzle darkens to a midnight black, which 
echoes his eyes, and stands out in stark contrast to his shining 
white hide. His mane is left long, flowing free across the right 
side of his neck, and his tail falls to below his hocks. A well 
defined head is topped by slightly long ear, which thrust 
purposefully through the long wayward mane.

Zephyr massively built ivory-coated charger horse stallion POF_HC_LEAD~
a massively built, ivory-coated charger~
A massively built, ivory-coated charger stands here.~
   This Destrier stallion standing roughly sixteen and a half 
hands tall, seems ideally bred for both speed and strength. His 
dense muscular haunches and chest are clearly visible from 
underneath a sleek healthy coat of a solid ivory shade. The only 
variation to his coats coloration is along the crowned edges of 
his mane, tail and feathers which darken into a muted shade of 
sable. Where visible an occasional scar or pockmark can be 
easily seen over this proud beasts flesh, most of which to the 
keen observer appear to have been well tended. Bulbous, 
glistening, dark-brown eyes move about in an alert, tandem motion 
from each side of his broad head. Despite this stallion's 
massive build his legs appear of a more tensile and sleek 
muscular nature and yet more then capable of bearing a great deal 
of weight.

Jhovair bald-headed, braided-beard man GUARD_POFAER HEREN~
a bald-headed, braided-beard man~
A bald-headed, braided-beard man stands here.~
   Towering over most men, this man's broad shoulders and thick 
neck define his entire build as one of corded, sinewy muscle 
tissue. His head is shaven completely bald and kept free of any 
hair growth; in contrast to his face which bears a well-groomed, 
blonde beard that is kept in a pair of thick braids. His flesh 
although a fair milky tone has a warm rosy hue that borders just 
under the surface of his cheeks and hands. His cobalt eyes are 
shadowed and seem smaller then normal under the pronounced bone 
structure of his browline and the pair of thick blonde eyebrows. 
His thick corded legs, most often, make his gait seem clumsy and 
slow.

An athletic long-limbed lad with red-gold hair is here.~
   This young lad's abundant red-gold hair tumbles beyond his 
shoulders in thick waves, framing a perfectly oval shaped face. 
Large bright grey-blue eyes are set below a smooth high forehead, 
and flanking a straight, fine nose. His skin is pale, high 
cheekbones flecked with freckles, which become more pronounced 
during the summer. His frame is long and lean, though lithe and 
athletic, and he is fairly tall for his age.

A short-muzzled, glossy-coated mare stands here calmly, whickering.~
   Of average bulk and graceful tone, this creature's coat and
mane are well-groomed and cut, hinting that it leads a life of
domestication rather than one in the wilderness. Standing tall
on four muscular legs, there is no hesitancy or fear detectable
in this horse's posture, seemingly ready to spring into a flurry
of action and motion at a moment's notice.

A small, sable and white puppy almost swamped by his incredibly dense fur is here.~
   Coloured a striking sable and white with grey guard hairs, 
this tiny puppy is almost swamped by his incredibly dense double 
coat of fur. The top coat is coarse, protecting him from the 
weather, while the reddish undercoat over his back and white fur 
covering his chest and belly is extremely soft. His honey-brown 
eyes are almond shaped, large and narrowly set in white face, 
while his marginally flattened snout is tipped with a black nose. 
He is squat, a mere fifteen inches in height, with short legs and 
large paws, his plume-like tail curling backwards, its tip 
brushing the middle his black-fur-striped spine. Enormous, 
black-tipped ears are bat-like on either side of his skull, 
folding slightly forward at the tips.

   Coloured a striking sable and white with grey guard hairs, 
this young dog is covered in an incredibly dense double coat of 
fur. The top coat is coarse, protecting him from adverse 
weather, while the reddish undercoat over his back and white fur 
covering his chest and belly is extremely soft and warm. 
Honey-brown eyes sit slightly narrow in his white face, while his 
marginally flattened snout is tipped with a black nose. He is 
squat, only twenty inches in height, with short legs and large 
paws, his waving, plume-like tail curling backwards, its tip 
brushing the middle his black-fur-striped spine. Large, 
black-tipped ears are bat-like on either side of his skull, 
folding slightly forward at the tips.

An aging black and grey dog stands here.~
   This dog has shaggy fur which is mostly a pale grey hue except 
for two large splotches of black over his striking blue eyes, 
though the black splotches have began silvering in small 
sprinkles. His body is quite muscled and large, though he looks 
to be losing the healthy girth to deterioration of age. His head 
would reach to the mid-thigh of one with an average height, where 
it not held a bit lower, a clear sign of old-age.

A stumpy older man with lapis-hued eyes tends to the stall.~
   A fatigued, timeworn look persists upon the aged visage of 
this stumpy older man. His lapis-hued eyes are narrow, almost 
squinted, and are ruled over by large, faintly-graying eyebrows. 
Hiding beneath the tiny glossy orbs, and across his rough 
forehead is a complimentary combination of small scars and 
wrinkles. A thin reddish-gray braid nestles between the man's 
wide shoulders, snaking down from just beneath a miniscule 
balding spot.

Mercer scarred burly man WARDOG_STALLS~
a scarred burly man~
A scarred burly man tends to the stall.~
   This burly man stands over a pair of thick, well-built legs 
that seem able to support him even if the ground under him 
swiveled fiercely. His features are harsh and common, bearing as 
only distinguishing mark a series of scars that seem to speak of 
experience in the art of combat. His right eye is gone, thanks 
to a blunt and large blow that left a hideous mark in the 
surrounding flesh. His hands are large and appear heavy and 
calloused, testimony to the life this man must have led.

Chapman oiled-haired potbelly man WARDOG_STALLS~
a oiled-haired, potbelly man~
A oiled-haired, potbelly man tends to the stall.~
   Thick, black hair hangs in ringlets around his forehead and 
middle-neck, oiled enough to give it a slick appearance. This 
man's height and frame are non-descript, save that he bears 
little muscle and a slight potbelly. A thick mustache, as black 
and oiled as his hair, hangs on his top lip, dropping down to 
just above his hard chin.

Colier muscular bald man WARDOG_STALLS~
a muscular, bald man~
A muscular, bald man tends to the stall.~
   Meaty and entirely bald, this prodigious man`s head seems to 
completely merge into a thick, muscular neck, and then a broad 
torso with melon shoulders. His large, oval eyes with tiny 
dark-brown irises surrounding a button nose are spaced somewhat 
close together so that they form an imposing and angry look 
whenever his thick reddish eyebrows intrude over his egg-white 
eyes. A rounded belly decorates the man`s muscular stature.

A stout blonde woman with chocolate brown eyes stands guard here.~
   This short woman appears tough and rugged though often good 
natured, with a friendly smile. Her blonde hair is kept cropped 
short and her muscles are well defined. On her knuckles, 
scratches and bruises are a common sight.

an older, hunchbacked gentleman~
An older man with a hunched back looks after the gate.~
   This gentleman has very little hair left atop his head and 
what is there is white and thin. His posture, which looks to be 
naturally tall in height, is greatly stunted by his severe slouch 
that leaves a large hump on his upper back. Missing teeth, an 
oversized nose, and a large mole on his left cheek make his face 
rather distinct and unattractive. Despite his unfortunate 
appearance, he does appear quite hale for one of his age.
