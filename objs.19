An archaic shield fragment is displayed here.~
   This small fragment looks like it was was once the bottom edge 
of a shield. The metal has been dulled to a dim silver, having 
lost most of its shine with the touch of time. Crawling over the 
surface like cobwebs are small veins of rust, most prominent 
along the edges. Despite the damage to it, deep etchings still 
cover it in a labyrinthial design, forming incomplete depictions. 
The trough of the etchings have are filled with gold to emphasize 
the patterns, which unlike the metal, shows no sign of rusting.

a large oil-painting of a white tree~
A large oil-painting of a white tree is here.~
   The tips of dark, gnarled roots, steadily progress and expand 
into paler tones as they crawl up to become a treetrunk. Gnarled 
and worn, patterns swirl in shapes over the bark, creeping along 
mossy-green patches verdant and young, while others are darker 
and older in appearance. Dappled strokes create the mottled 
affair, the grooved texture emphasizing the aged appearance of 
the tree. By the time the trunk evolves into a mighty expanse of 
branches, the colours chosen are varying degrees of white. 
Leaves sprout from smaller extension, painted meticulously and 
with great detail. Curling tips are soaked in golden yellow that 
arch into veins covering the off-white surface of the leaves 
themselves. The great white tree stands watch over a hillside 
that hosts a field of green grass, no one blade exactly as the 
rest in its nestle. Light tones are made even lighter due to 
contrast of the background given by a turmoiled sky, 
orange-crested clouds morphing into deeper greys and near blacks, 
speaking of a time the sun is setting. The focal point of the 
piece is unquestionably the white tree, whose pale hues serve to 
draw the eye almost immediatly.

fingers have worn the surface smooth save for the farthest 
outgrowth, which has a jagged edge, almost as if that part of the 
shell had broken off or been severed.

A stately, grey-eyed young man is here.~
Excessively detailed, this carving has been fashioned from blue 
green granite and dark oak wood that has been laminted to shine 
even within the dimmest of light. The entire artworks is about 
four wide and rests upon a circular stone base that rises up to 
create a great hillside against a city. Three compact wooden 
quarters-connected by narrow, winding streets twind up through 
elaborate little porticulles gates and thin tunnels carved out of 
the hill's bluish granite. Each individual quarter is raised 
higher then the other, resulting in a tiered arrangement. 
Throughout the small cities passages are buildings adorned with 
elborate wood work that has been brightly painted into yellow and 
green. Ivy vines and carvings of wildlife are placed in wooden 
archways above small areas bearing miniature trees and benches. 
At the zenith of the city, set into the side of the hillside, is 
what seems to be a large gate of some kind. Nearby, jutting out 
from the rock base, is a carefully carved stone tower that by 
comparison, reaches well above any other structure in height.

lies a matching thin scarf held in place with two small bands. 
The bodice then covers from the shoulders to the waist rising 
higher on the hips and settling into a slight V in the front. 
The long sleeves begin to flare just below the elbow, ending at 
the wrist in a wide dark blue hanging cuffs. The full skirt is 
long and simple, reaching all the way to the floor. The bottom

An ancient, jet-black music box sits here.~
   Whorls swirls around the four corners of this box, engraved 
into the polished exterior. Those curves ripple into the 
center-areas only to suddenly halt where they are joined in an 
almost chaotic merging by straighter lines. Everything flows 
together to form extravagant forms and intricate patterns that 
hold no certain shape of one thing or another. Chips fracture 
the vessel, littered profusely around the lower-left edge, but 
the majority of the box remains intact. Its lid is slightly 
larger than the rest of it and bears upon it a lone image, that 
of a lake, impressed into its very center, perhaps the most 
stunning in its simplicity and isolation It has been carved 
deeply enough into the black stone of the box that it has been 
filled with what would appear to be water and sealed with a layer 
of almost transparent blue stone, showing its only colour 
whenever the right angle of light falls over it; and when it 
does, it shimmers. At the mouth of the lid is a slight indent, a 
gap that allows a view deeper into the dark spaces hidden from 
sight: but there lays only the muted gleam of what seems to thin 
iron wires spaced evenly.

An silver brooch inlaid with six black pearls is on display here.~
   This silver brooch of fine craft work is inset with black 
pearls. Overall, it resembles a birds nest with six eggs. An 
ostentatious fringe surrounds each 'egg', a fanciful wreath of 
fronds that sits slightly higher than the base. Upon each onyx 
pearl is a barely-noticeable chasing of a bird that changes from 
the first to the last to tell a small story. The first image 
shows the little bird from where it is sitting upon a branch, to 
the moment when it is opening its wings. Upon the final pearl it 
has taken flight. While there is nothing remarkable about the 
bird itself, the skill that must have gone into the carefully 
composed etchings remains unquestioned.

sockets of this small statuette. Made of silver, it has by all 
appearance similarities to a wolf: but stands upon legs far 
longer than any of such kin to be found within the wilds. Its 
made in a stance that supports a coming leap, with its head 
tucked down low and its nose curved up into the air. Lips are 
pulled up, little detail having gone into the mouth itself, but 
enough to demonstrate not one, but two rows of teeth. The hair 
upon its back stands raised in between the bulk of muscles upon a 
great-chested form.
