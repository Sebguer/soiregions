Grassy Meadowland~
   Various shades of green grass dominate this meadow, dotted 
with woody brown bushes and the occasional patch of small white 
flowers. Here along the river, many colorful creatures add to 
the majestic beauty when they are spotted - the dark black mole, 
the orange-red box, and the many rainbow beetles that live along 
the river. Green meadow grassland stretches into the south, 
turning into a peaty bog. The Limlight heads towards the 
northwest, curving along on its path towards the Entwood.

A Meadow Along the Limlight~
   Even when the wind is still, this swath of meadowland seems 
constantly in motion. Patches of different grasses make this 
area of riverside veldt a canvas of colors, ranging from silvery 
blue-grey to a deep verdant green. Tall weeds and woody twigs 
mingle with the grass, creating homes for many small creatures 
that burrow and skitter out of sight, leaving only rustling in 
their wake. Here the Limlight curves along the north and eastern 
banks, preparing to spill into the Undeeps of the Anduin.

The Limlight Empties into the Anduin~
   The Limlight completes its journey from the Misty Mountains 
and empties into the mighty Anduin as it begins its slow, 
meandering way through the northern plains of Gondor. A deep 
pool has been created here by the lively, smaller river swirling 
into the massive Anduin. To the west, wide, hilly lands run to 
meet the Misty Mountais far away. On a rocky promontory to the 
east, an overgrown, damaged stone stronghold sits atop a mound.

Below a weathered stone Keep~
   Jutting up from the flat nearby meadowlands, a rocky 
promontory overlooks the joining of the Limlight and the Anduin 
rivers. Flat green grass and brown woody shrubs sprout from the 
surface, while green-brown lichen mosses cling to the exposed 
rocks. Sitting atop the hill, a badly overgrown and damaged 
stone stronghold testifies to some past glory age of Man. Its 
bleached stones and rotted woodwork add a melancholy air to the 
otherwise beautiful view of the riverbed below.

The Anduin East of a Rocky Promontory~
   The Anduin follows along the widening riverbed, its flow 
slowed as it creeps around the rocky outcrop from the promontory 
to the west. Easily seen here from the river, a battered and 
broken stronghold sits along the hilltop to the west, its form 
overgrown and covered in moss and vines. Large rocks, perhaps 
tumbled from the nearby keep are visible at the deep bottom of 
the clear riverbed. The river winds easily towards the east, 
spilling into the marshland south.

The Anduin Spills into Plains~
   Sitting along a bend in the Anduin River, this rich area of 
field is carpeted with thick, lush green grass and several 
standing trees provide a rare chance at shade. Deep and smooth, 
the trees reflect back against the crystalline surface of the 
water a picturesque nature view. The flat land edging the river 
allows it to widen, leading to a boggy swamp visible in the 
southern distance. Breezes brought in on the sea air barely 
rustle the trees, but keep the air fresh. A series of small flat 
stones create a hazardous but possible way across the river.

Upon the Deep Anduin~
   Running from the northeastern hills, here the waters of the 
Limlight and the Anduin mix, the deep clear water carving its way 
through the countryside. The southern riverbank is overgrown 
with thick water grass and tall grey-brown catkins that often 
blow loose buds and fill the air with small, cotton-white covered 
seeds. Small, pudgy brown birds chirp and flit amongst the 
reeds, and the occasional splash betrays the fish that linger 
just below the water's surface.

The Anduin Curves Westward~
   In its inexorable push to the Great Sea, the mighty Anduin 
runs clean and strong here, its clear surface rippling as it 
flows northward. Balanced between hills to the north and heath 
to the south, the meandering river is visible some distance in 
both directions as it winds around the nearby landscape. The 
high calls of predator birds often rent the air as they follow 
the river seeking a meal of shiny fish that wiggle by.

A Shrub Dotted Riverbed~
   Low, woodsy brown shrubs dot this area, their tangled roots 
sopping up the run over of moisture from the nearby Anduin. With 
no visible trees and little other large vegetation, this small 
area is apt to turn boggy when the river exceeds its banks. 
Small, water-rounded rocks deposited from an earlier flood are 
covered in green-brown lichen moss, their earthy smell mixing 
with the breeze. Haphazard clumps of wild light purple heather 
add some color to this otherwise dull riverbed.

   Between the mighty Anduin and the foreboding eastern steppe, 
this patch of land barely clings to the moisture seeping in from 
the river. Small clumps of purple-topped heather and low green 
grass gradually turning into dull yellows and browns showing the 
stark contrast between the riverlands and the dry, flat plain 
beyond. Barely visible, small brown bodies often dash and dart 
between the grasses; animals working hard for survival on the 
edge of such harsh barrens.

stand in contrast to the free open plains.

   West of a river-spilled marshland, the grass here is tall and 
lush, its roots thick with few visible weeds or flowers managing 
to sprout. Under several small woody shrubs scatter haphazardly 
across the field, small and half-concealed burrow holes mark this 
otherwise clear grassy field, home to some small meadow mammals 
who scamper back and forth across the field, their small brown 
bodies often momentarily visible amidst the thick green grass.

Marshland Southeast of the Limlight~
   Here the Limlight river overspills its banks, creating a 
marshy swampland as it mixes with the low thinly tufted grass. 
The water lazily moves towards the south, tiny silver fish and 
small black tadpoles swim about just under the water's surface, 
this swampy spot perfect for less agile life forms. The loud 
croaks of frogs and the lonely calls of cranes and kingfishers 
who come to dine on them, fill the air with a cacophony of sound.

Marshland South of the Limlight~
   Water from the nearby Anduin has spilled onto this grassy 
lowland, creating a swampy bog. Short green grass intertwines 
with nubby brown bushes and several hollow trees, the insides 
long since rotten away from insects and the nearby conditions. 
Lichens and moss cover nearly every surface plant, an acrid and 
earthy smell pervading area. Beavers often swim in from their 
elaborate dam build to the south, gathering up fallen twigs.

Mire South of a Tall Promontory~

promontory to the north, silt and gravel washed down from the 
cliff face clogging the river's flow and creating a thick mire. 
The brown, murky water is covered in a layer of round green 
algae, which tiny fish bob from below the surface and gulp up 
from time to time. Thick green-brown catkins and marsh ferns 
grow along the water's edges, the gentle buzz of many a 
blue-green dragonfly flitting amongst them.

   As the Anduin travels southward, it becomes wide and shallow, 
the current slowing but yet powerful. Small barren hills rise to

the eye can see. But here there is life, the stones are covered 
with moss and small silvery fish dart through the knee-deep 
water.

   Looking to the east, one can see the tops of several smaller 
hillocks from the high point of this relatively tall summit. A 
barren plain stretches endlessly in the eastern horizon, the 
grass brown, thin, and sparse. Several knee-high rocks punctuate 
the barren landscape, weathered and clad in dried lichens, they 
attest in an earlier time with more abundant water. Towards the 
northwest, the Anduin continues on its journey to the sea, 
meandering wide and shallow here in the Undeeps.

Surrounded by Hills~
   In this relatively flat area, shrub-like trees and hardy grass 
grow, surrounded by hills on all sides save the north, along 
which flows the deep Anduin as it prepares to enter the Undeeps. 
When the wind blows, the trees and grass sway stiffly--they do 
not wave like the healthy green grasses of a field. The ground 
is hard and gritty, making life impossible for all but the 
hardiest plants, and difficult for those that do take root.

block the path of the Anorien's drainage creating a haven for 
moss and tall cattail reeds. The chirping, crocking and clicking 
of a variety of creatures fills the air, this edge-marsh their 
last respite from the harsher plains beyond.

   Rising out of the tall grasses like a dark island from 
golden-green seas is an enormous and rotting tree stump. Nearly 
the height of a normal man in radius, this vast giant must have 
been cut down in ages past, judging from the decay and growth 
covering the wood. Insects have eaten away vast divots and 
slopes from what may have, in times past, been a relatively level 
cut. The roots of this long gone giant spread out, lost in the 
ocean of weedy plantlife.

occasional rock, great boulders piled up on small rises of land 
every so often. The shallow Undeeps of the Anduin curve along 
its eastern and southern borders.

from the Limlight to the north, only the minimalist of currents

clutter this small marsh, the rotting vegetation and ever-present 
thick green moss clinging to most surfaces creates a prominent,

flies fill the air the a constant drone. The watery marsh gives 
way to a softer green heath to the east, south, and southeast.

quickly rises into a knobby hill, its surface covered in soft 
grass, or oft many soft pastel wildflowers during springtime.

renting the air. A mossy, earthy scent pervades the area, and 
many areas with standing water buzz with flies. The nearly still 
water of the river continues off to the east.

A Ring of Bushes~
   The twisted, thorny bushes here are larger than usual, as high 
as a Mans head, and a score of them have grown in a large circle, 
their sharp thorny branches intertwined, presenting a formidable 
barricade to any who wish to pass. There is no other growth 
around the perimeter for a hundred strides in any direction, not 
even the hardy clumps of razor-sharp grass that dot the rest of 
this barren waste.

Patchy, Scrub-Dotted Hills~
   The ground here is rather arid, dotted with small, green and 
brown shrubs and a mixture of yellow and pale-green grasses. The 
lands to the east flatten to wasted plains, brown and dead. The 
mighty Anduin flows from northwest to southeast in the distance, 
wide and shallow as it wanders by.

This boulder is massive in size and has been shaped thoroughly by tools judging by the rough hackings marring its entirety. It blocks the large entrance to a cave in the face of cliff.

Crusted Brownlands~
   Stretching in all directions, the hard brown ground lays flat 
and featureless, unable to sustain more than scattered growths of 
hardy broad-leaved brown grass or an occasional stunted, twisted 
bush. The dirt is crusted and smooth on top, but boots break 
through sharply and suddenly at each step, sinking and sliding 
slightly, making it impossible to feel as if one has ones 
balance. A slight haze seems to blur the meeting of land and sky 
in all directions.

A Verdant Lowland Pasture~
   Level pasture dotted with shrubs, stones, and several small 
trees spreads out in all directions here. The soil, rich in 
appearance, holds several small watering holes making the area 
rich in wildlife and fauna. Many clusters of wild flowers grow 
throughout the area, as well as a good number of bushes and 
several groups of various trees, providing homes to a variety of 
creatures.

A Deep Pool in the Anduin~
   As the Anduin splits around a large rock to the southeast, it 
has carved out a deeper spot in the riverbed here. The surface 
of the water is smooth and clearly mirrored upon it are the 
towering rocks to the south and west.

A Scrub-Dotted Land~
   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby 
and wiry bushes, and on the western stretches, some stretches of 
pale grass that bows in the wind.

Inhospitable Scrublands~
   The only growth visible in all directions are sparse clumps of 
hardy, sharp-bladed grass and rare scraggly bushes with small, 
thick, waxy grayish leaves. The earth here is loose and sandy, 
slightly mounded in places by winds. The grey brittle skeletons 
of dead bushes still bear thorns to tear at any unwary enough to 
brush against them, and the edges of the grass slices bare skin, 
as if the inhospitable land itself tries to drive away intruders.

plains and the softer, greener heath bordering the Anduin. 
Little animal life is to be seen here, and only few specimens of 
hardy plant life.

A Dry Creek Bed~
   Ruts and indentations, running generally north and south make 
it obvious that once water ran in this shallow creek bed. It is 
filled with smooth pebbles and rocks, their colors dulled with 
dust. The edges of the erosion are rounded and broken, their 
depths smoothed by sand, giving the impression that it has been 
long since water flowed here. The barren, brown land stretches 
in all directions, otherwise unbroken save for scattered clumps 
of razor-sharp grass and stunted, thorn-infested bushes.

   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the

Rocky Hills~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks.

boulder~
This boulder is massive in size and has been shaped thoroughly by tools judging by the rough hackings marring its entirety. It blocks the large entrance to a cave in the face of cliff.

A Crescent of Barren Ridges~
   A low crescent of rugged, rocky ridges push through the barren 
earth, their blunted tops stark against the sky. Rocks and 
boulders cover the slopes, precarious upon the loose soil. 
Climbing over them is exhausting and perilous, as every step up 
slides back down at least half as far, and often the climbers 
will find themselves sliding all the way to the foot of the hills 
amidst an avalanche of rocks. In places the raw stone underneath 
has been exposed by the sliding rocks.

Flat Wastelands~
   Flat, featureless wastelands extend in all directions, 
blurring into the sky at the edges of vision. Stunted, twisted 
bushes struggle to survive at rare intervals, their thorny 
branches bearing sparsely set small leaves of grayish-grean, 
thick and waxy. Clumps of broad-leaved grass are more common, 
the blades sharp enough to slice the bare skin of the unwary. 
The ground shifts underfoot, loose and sandy.

Green Fields~
   Healthy green grass can be seen all over this area, covering 
the rolling fields like a knee-deep emerald carpet. Small shrubs 
are scattered haphazardly across the grass, which undulates like 
the waves of a sea with every breath of wind or passing creature.

Hill Covered with Brown Grass~
   A thick growth of low lying bushes roams across the hills that 
form the northern banks of the Undeeps. To the east lies a vast, 
brown plain, nearly devoid of life. Small animal life darts 
amongst the clustered clumps of vegetation, as well as the 
occasional larger predator lurking near the life-giving waters.

Patchy, Scrub-Dotted Hills ~
   The ground here is rather arid, dotted with small, green and 
brown shrubs and a mixture of yellow and pale-green grasses. 
Travel is made easy by the hardened earth, though there is 
neither sign of civilization, nor any reason for one to travel 
here apparent. The lands to the north seem greener, while 
rolling hills raise out from the ground to the west.

A Scrub-Dotted Plain~
   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby 
and wiry bushes, and on the western stretches, some stretches of 
pale grass that bows in the wind.

A Grassy Knoll~
   Healthy green grass coats the area, larger hills looming off 
in the distance as wildflowers and other vegetation poke up from 
the earth along with sparse rock formations jutting upwards to 
meet the sky.

An Overshadowed Plateau before the Ephel Duath~
   The stark range of the Ephel Duath roams from north to south 
here, this land a bumpy, rocky spit of land situated before the 
steep ascent of the mountains to the east and the softer, greener 
hillands of South Ithilien to the west. The only life to be seen 
here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make their homes 
in the craggy lips and caves visible on the surface of the dark 
mountains.

The Mighty Anduin Curves Eastward~
   As the great river begins a snaking curve around rocky pieces 
of land extending first from the south and then from the north 
banks, it yet flows deep, though shallower waters lie to the 
west. The water is clear and clean, and filled with life.

the ravine with intermittant patches of emerald green grass 
peeking through in tufts. At the top of the ravine, the roots of 
various trees poke through the earth, dangling in the air

The Beginning of a Deeper Stretch of the River~
   As the river narrows, it deepens again, running slowly 
eastward for a few miles between heath to the north and rocky 
hills to the south. The water is clear and clean and filled with 
life, a contrast to the blasted brown ground that stretches 
northward beyond the narrow strip of heath.

   Unusual in the meandering Undeeps, here the Anduin runs deep

south rise rocky hills.

The Anduin Widens~
   As it exits a narrower channel, the Anduin spreads northward, 
becoming shallower, but here the river bottom is still far below 
the glassy surface. The water is clear and clean, and the 
occasional silvery flash of a feeding fish can be seen as it 
darts to the surface and then disappears. The southern bank is 
rocky and steep.

A Wide Curve in the River~
   The deep channel curves northward here, the mighty river 
carving out the softer bottom. Shallow waters lie to the east, 
filling in a large arcing curve against a rocky promontory 
extending form the southern bank, upon which can be seen a 
battered stone keep.

Overgrown Grassy Fields South of the River~
   The broad fields adjoining the Undeeps of the Anduin are wild 
and overgrown, tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the 
wide, windswept plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground 
is hard underfoot, and interspersed with more than the occasional 
rock, great boulders piled up on small rises of land every so 
often.

A Grass-Covered Knoll~
   Healthy green grass coats the area, larger hills looming off 
in the distance as wildflowers and other vegetation poke up from 
the earth along with sparse rock formations jutting upwards to 
meet the sky. To the south, the knoll drops into a deep ravine.

A Rock-strewn Edgemarsh~
   This last bit of marshland stretches in from the west and off 
towards the northeast, blending into the dry, taupe-colored 
canvas of the Undeeps beyond. Several large, ancient boulders 
block the path of the Anorien's drainage creating a haven for 
moss and tall cattail reeds. The chirping, crocking and clicking 
of a variety of creatures fills the air, this edge-marsh their 
last respite from the harsher plains beyond.

Spare Hills Between the River and the Brown Lands~
   The ground here is far from flat, rising in waves of hills and 
falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that 
spurts forth from the ground and is accompanied by a clustering 
of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
plains of the Brown Lands to the north, and then falls again 
southward to the Undeeps of the Anduin.

A Jutting Rock in Barren Lands~
   Incongruous in the parched, barren dirt, this slab of granite 
juts from the ground, as if a giant of stone is buried beneath 
the earth and claws for the sky. It leans at an angle, and is 
flat on the top, though the bottom is concave. There is evidence 
that travelers have sheltered there, a torn waterskin, a tattered 
cloth. Otherwise, in all directions, the land stretches flat and 
featureless, broken only by meager growth.

Barren Wastelands~
   Grey, brittle skeletons of dead bushes tear at cloaks and 
clothing. Some have torn loose from the sandy soil and roll 
before the slightest breeze, a lost, restless effort to escape 
from the desolate, barren plains. The living bushes are grey 
with dust, with sparse, waxy grayish-green leaves, scattered 
about far apart . The flat expanse stretches as far as the eye 
can see in every direction, dotted by clumps of brow, sharp grass 
that slices at unwary passersby.

   Shrubs and nutrient rich, naked soil dot the steep incline of 
the ravine to either side. pebbles mark the soil at the base of 
the ravine with intermittant patches of emerald green grass 
peeking through in tufts. At the top of the ravine, the roots of 
various trees poke through the earth, dangling in the air

throughout the area, as well as a good number of bushes and 
several groups of various trees, providing homes to a variety of 
creatures.

A Rich Lowland Area~
   Level pasture dotted with shrubs, stones, and several small 
trees spreads out in all directions here. The soil, rich in 
appearance, holds several small watering holes making the area 
rich in wildlife and fauna. Many clusters of wild flowers grow 
throughout the area, as well as a good number of bushes and 
several groups of various trees, providing homes to a variety of 
creatures.

Hill Coated with Brown Grass~
   A thick growth of low lying bushes roams across the hills that 
form the eastern banks of the Undeeps. To the east lies a vast, 
brown plain, nearly devoid of life. Small animal life darts 
amongst the clustered clumps of vegetation, as well as the 
occasional larger predator lurking near the life-giving waters.

   Healthy green grass can be seen all over this area, covering 
the rolling fields like an emerald carpet. Small shrubs are 
scattered haphazardly across the field. The shallow waters of 
the Undeeps cut through to the south.

A Shattered Fort~
   One wonders what possessed anyone to build even a small fort 
in this forsaken land. But someone did, some time, of roughly 
dressed stones. They are tumbled all about now, and some show 
strange signs of scorching as if by fire. The dust has filled 
the spaces between them and has mounded all about. There are no 
other signs of habitation, or any clues as to who might have 
lived, or died, here.

Thinly Wooded, Rocky Hills~
   A series of rocky, bumpy hills running north and south are 
covered with a thin deciduous forest. Amidst the rocky ground, 
the knots of trees grows tall. The sound of the mighty Anduin 
flowing can be heard clearly, and occasional glints from its 
surface can be caught through the trees when looking southeast. 
To the east, the woods give way to a grassy field.

A Small Glen     ~
   Heavily dotted with thick leafy bushes and flush with thick 
grass, this area seems an ideal habitat for wildlife as birds are 
heard chirping from trees as the hide amongst the foliage and 
narrow game trails cut through the area, leading to a narrow 
stream running from the west, through which fish flit about and 
the occassional animal may be seen drinking from.

Deep in a Small Glen~
   The narrow stream leads to a small waterfall, water cascading 
and splashing down a fifteen foot drop along a smooth rockface, 
into a pool which feeds the stream. Along the shore of the pool 
is dotted with many pebbles and stones. Further off the shore 
groups of bushes, herbs and flowers grow, some of which look like 
they have been chewed upon by the local wildlife.

flowing can be heard clearly, and occasional glints from its 
surface can be caught through the trees when looking eastwards. 
To the north, the woods thin out around a small glen.

Barren Wastelands~
   The flat expanse stretches as far as the eye can see in every 
direction, dotted by clumps of brow, sharp grass that slices at 
unwary passersby. 
   Grey, brittle skeletons of dead bushes tear at cloaks and 
clothing. Some have torn loose from the sandy soil and roll 
before the slightest breeze, a lost, restless effort to escape 
from the desolate, barren plains. The living bushes are grey 
with dust, with sparse, waxy grayish-green leaves, scattered 
about far apart.

Windblown Sand~
   Bones, obviously part of what was once a huge ribcage, jut 
from the sand. Despite being half buried, the bones arc up over 
the tallest mans head. Many along the right side have been 
broken jaggedly and then the edges worn smooth by the effects of 
sand, wind, and time. There are no other bones visible anywhere 
in sight, nor anything else in the barren lands save occasional 
stunted bushes and clumps of brown grass.

Before the Looming Face of a Wind-Battered Butte~
   Pocked and pitted from countless years of wind and sand, a 
great hill of stone rises from the earth. Its slopes 
treacherously steep and made of some kind of dark, loose rock, 
boulders rest against the sides like silent guardians. One side 
of the hill loose partially collapsed, as though by a landslide 
that seems to have occurred some time ago. A ridge traces its 
way across the face of the hill towards the top, disappearing 
over the top.

Atop A Windblown Hilltop~
   Blasted by wind and sun, the earlier loose sand of the hill 
has given way to a hard-baked yellow clay. Split and cracked in 
spider-web patterns all across the hilltop, the clay holds 
half-buried bits of rock and sediment in its ancient grip. A 
grove of dried and burned-out pines still lingers on the small 
butte, but most of the trees have fallen to rest atop the rock, 
fire-blackened and destroyed. Overlooking the range of hills in 
the distance is a small set of cairns, the ancient stones worn 
smooth by the passage of time. Any markings have long since 
faded, until only the stones remain.

Between of a Series of Buttes~
   Looming like great hunks of misshapen earth, a series of 
large, flat-topped hills rise into the distance. Gullies and 
ravines cut between the hunched rises of barren stone, 
proclaiming that water might've once flowed through, but no 
longer. Instead, the cracked and parched earth stands mute of 
birdsong and all but devoid of life, the occasional twisted, 
petrified tree-trunk or large boulder marking the shallow valleys 
between the hills.

Upon the Slope of a Sandy Hill~
   Rough and jagged patches of stone interweave with stretches of 
broken sand, crumbling underfoot. The occasional half-buried 
root stretches across the loose shale to catch the unwary 
travelers passing. Rarely a tuft of greyish grass can be seen, 
struggling up from the sand and rock to lift towards the sky. 
More often, tufts of dry and yellowed grass linger amid the sharp 
stones, lifeless.

Before the Slope of a Rocky Hill~
   Strewn along the dusty, loose soil is an assortment of 
palm-sized, sharp shale rocks. Here and there a stunted, 
misshapen bush lurks amid the stones and dirt, though almost 
without fail the leaves have faded to a pale brown from lack of 
water and too much sun. A small stand of dead trees rests on the 
leeward side of the valley, the broken and snapped branches still 
reaching towards the sky. In the distance lie a set of low, 
rolling hills, each as barren as the tiny valley nestled between 
them.

A Rich Pasture, Lowland Area~
   Level pasture dotted with shrubs, stones, and several small 
trees spreads out in all directions here. The soil, rich in 
appearance, holds several small watering holes making the area 
rich in wildlife and fauna. Many clusters of wild flowers grow 
throughout the area, as well as a good number of bushes and 
several groups of various trees, providing homes to a variety of 
creatures.

Sparse, Rocky Woodland~
   A series of rocky, bumpy hills stretching northward are 
covered with a thin deciduous forest. Amidst the rocky ground, 
the knots of trees grows tall. To the east, the trees give out 
onto a clear lowland, covered with grass and an occasional shrub. 
The sound of the mighty Anduin flowing can be heard clearly, and 
occasional glints from its surface can be caught through the 
trees when looking northeast.

Atop a Large Hill~
   From here, all about is a panoramic view of woodlands, cliff faces, brushlands and all sorts of vegetation. To the north is the shallow, slow running Anduin.  Atop the hill are a small cluster of birch trees, white bark clinging to them tightly with scraps missing here and there as the branches spread upwards. The area is mostly clean of rocks.

A Low Range of Hills~
   Stretching into the distance is a low range of hills, barren 
and devoid of nearly everything but the occasional twisted, 
petrified tree. Bands of alternating colored rock sometimes mar 
the surface of the hills, the rich ochre, crimsons and greys 
striping through the vastness of the rock. Just within sight is 
another range, this one stretching a little bit beyond the first.

A Small Gully Between Hills~
   Cleft between the gently heaving hills of the range, a gully 
cuts through the land like a writhing band. What was probably 
once a small stream has dried to only dust and rock and the 
occasional struggling bit of plant life peering from beneath the 
loose soil. Within the gully itself, sheltered by the wind, 
yellowish grass and sandbars line the sides and bottom, sometimes 
even obscuring the rock bottom.

The Windward Side of a Snaking Hill~
   Sinking down into a low valley before the rise of another 
rolling hill, the land snakes and twists to the valley floor. 
The sand seems to have mostly blown from this face of the hill, 
leaving only a tough yellow clay and sharp bits of broken shale 
in its wake. No bushes or vegetation sprouts from the blasted 
soil here, it's remarkable only in its barren serenity.

On a Jagged Ridge of Rock, Overlooking Low Hills~
   From atop this mound of jagged and broken rock stretches hills 
into the distance, the valleys hidden while the caps of them are 
shown to be only broken and unforgiving rock. The ridge itself 
is positioned at the height of one such hill, a weather-beaten 
and barely visible track leading from the ridge down into the 
valleys on either side. Bare rock and sand sit in dusty heaps, 
clustered together as if for safety from the coming of the winds.

meet the sky.

Atop a Cliff~
   Atop a hill, a sheer cliff stands to the west--a gaping wound 
as tall as the hill itself. Small washed-out rain ruts can be 
seen near the edge of the cliff, telling the story of this hill's 
demise. The ground near the cliff appears unsteady and unwilling 
to bear much weight. From this high vantage point can be seen a 
rocky island rising from the midst of the shallow Undeeps to the 
north.

Beside a Cliff~
   A cliff to the east stands like a gaping mouth above the 
ground, cut out of a hill by time and weather. At its base are 
years of fallen sediment and small rocks, brothers to those that 
are still embedded in the gravelly face of the cliff. Walking 
near the cliff, occasional rolling stones and shifting gravel can 
be seen as the hill decays.

Overgrown Grassy Fields South of Shallow Waters~
   These broad fields adjoining the Undeeps of the Anduin are 
wild and overgrown, tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in 
the wide, windswept plains untamed by the hands of men. The 
ground is hard underfoot, and interspersed with more than the 
occasional rock, great boulders piled up on small rises of land 
every so often.

A Grassy Field~
   Healthy green grass can be seen all over this area, covering 
the rolling fields as an emerald carpet. Small shrubs can be 
seen scattered haphazardly across the field, some bearing berries 
and some not. To the north, beyond a stretch of shallow water, a 
rocky island rises.

Knee-High Grasses by the River~
   Grey-green grass rises from the ground, nearly knee high on an 
average-sized man. The thick blades provide landing space for a 
wide variety of insects and once in a while even bow to the 
intrepid mouse. When the wind blows even slightly, the stalks 
rubbing together produce a gentle susurration. Even when still, 
however, a near constant background of shifting undergrowth and 
faint chittering of bugs remains a constant undertone. Here and 
there a colorful weed or flower breaks what might otherwise be a 
fairly monochrome view with unexpected color. To the north flow 
the shallow waters of the mighty Anduin.

A Lush, Verdant Field Among Hills~
   This is a relatively flat space among the softly undulating 
hills that surround it, which rise more sharply to the west. 
Amidst the field is a number of large stones lodged deeply in the 
earth around which fronds and other herbs and wildflowers grow. 
There are no worn trails and the area seems rich with the signs 
of wildlife with the occassional rustling of the grass.

Tough-Grassed Hills~
   The wild, tough grasses of the area have conquered the softly 
undulating ground here, and the vegetation resists the legs of 
the passing traveler just as the hills tax them. The Anduin is 
at its widest here, north and east, gathering itself together at 
the ending of the wide, shallow Undeeps, to begin its mighty, 
deep journey to the Great Sea. The river is so wide at this 
point that it seems nearly a shallow lake, in the middle of which 
can be seen a stone keep upon a rocky island. From here it looks 
somewhat old and battered.

The Slope of a Blasted Rise~
   As though torn by some great force in the distant past, a few 
large craters mar the surface of this slope. Razor-edged rock 
fragments lay in menacing formations, interwoven with hard-baked 
red and yellow clay. Further down the slope is striated bands of 
rock, the colors alternating every few feet. Twisted and 
malignant bushes shrug their limbs towards the baking heat of the 
sun in a few places, though they are all small and seemingly 
malnourished.

Approaching a Small Stone Dock Beneath A Towering Cliff~
   The mighty Anduin parts grudgingly around the northern face of 
Cair Andros. A dock, oft patched, has been built in some time 
long past in the eddies to the south. Looming above is the 
impressive mass of Cair Andros, a few whitewashed stone buildings 
clinging precariously to the cliff face. A narrow stair switches 
back and forth to climb the cliff, allowing access to the 
buildings. The rock bristles with defenses wherever a bit of 
stone allows purchase stands an archer's nest, a ballista, or a 
catapult. The overall effect is one of hundreds of watchful eyes 
upon those that approach, and of hundreds of weapons trained upon 
them, a forboding impression of the competence of this fortress.

On the Bottom of the Anduin~
   The waters of the Anduin are all pervasive here there is no 
escape from it save by swimming up to the distant surface. The 
dim light of Anor reveals vague, blurred shapes of the sloping 
river bank, waving fronds of plants moved by the current, and the 
silver flash of an occasional curious fish.

On the Bottom of the Anduin~
   The waters of the Anduin are all pervasive here there is no 
escape from it save by swimming up to the distant surface. The 
dim light of Anor reveals vague, blurred shapes of the sloping 
river bank, waving fronds of plants moved by the current, and the 
silver flash of an occasional curious fish.

Clinging to a Crumbling Cliff-face~
   The gravelly, shifting face of this cliff make the going 
treacherous. Every move causes sediment and small rocks to break 
free and go tumbling to the bottom. It is impossible to gain any 
firm purchase. From this vantage can be seen to the north a 
rocky island pushing up through the shallow waters of the wide 
Anduin.

On the Amdir Dock~
   The Great Anduin slams repeatedly against the stony bank, here 
at a small, recently-built wooden dock, which seems insignificant 
against the might of the River. High rocky banks rise up out of 
the water on three sides of the promontory, steadfastly holding 
Anduin's wrath at bay. A fort made of the thick trunks of tall 
trees can be seen to the east, and a humble muddy road wends its 
way toward the gate. The wind whips about the promontory with 
reckless abandon, threatening to carry away the many banners that 
fly upon the walls of the town. The massive rocky island of Cair 
Andros rises from the river to the west, a forbidding fortress 
clinging to its sheer southern face.

Before the West Gate of Amdir~
   The fortified village of Amdir sits upon a rocky promontory 
protruding out from the eastern bank of the Anduin, and is 
surrounded on three sides by the mighty river. The heavy wooden 
gate to the east is wide enough for a wagon to easily pass. 
Great logs, fire-hardened and sharpened at the top, are set on 
end side by side to form the village walls. Armed men wearing 
the black cloaks of Pel-Dagor or the green of Pel-Tirith peer 
down from the gatehouse and from the walkway above. An archery 
range has been set up along the wall north of the road, the 
farthest targets nearly at the edge of the promontory where the 
Anduin curves back eastward around the village. A dock has been 
recently built to the west, pointing just south of the great rock 
known as Cair Andros.

A Long, Narrow Strip of Land Alongside Log Walls~
   An archery range has been set up here on a narrow strip of 
land between the high log walls to the east and the deep Anduin 
to the west. The farthest targets extend beyond the northwest 
corner of the fort, nearly to the river as it curves from the 
east to the south around the rocky promontory upon which Amdir is 
built. The walls are made of heavy, long logs, fire hardened and 
sharpened at the top, set on end, tight against each other. 
Armed men wearing the black and green tree-marked cloaks of the 
Eastern Vanguard pace watchfully along the top of the wall.

a waterwheel attached to a large, windowless building constructed 
of logs. A gate leads into the stables to the north. A long 
deep trough runs along the stable wall, and a barrel is mounted 
above it on a strong rack, its spigot poised over the trough. A 
network of gutters bring rainwater to the barrel from the roofs 
of the building to the east and the stable.

A Stable Smelling of Horses and Leather~
   The dirt floor, though mostly clean, is scattered with bits of 
straw and marked by the passage of boots and shod horses. An 
aisle travels between stalls inhabited by everything from mules 
to great war steeds. Hard working ostlers muck stalls, brush and 
feed horses, and clean tack and barding at all hours. It smells 
strongly of horses, and the incessant low buzzing of insects is 
heard in all seasons. Lanterns hang from hooks above the aisle, 
illuminating the stable with a gentle glow. A pair of large 
double doors, big enough for a large wagon to pass, leads to the 
street to the north, and a smaller door, though still large 
enough for the biggest horse to pass through, is on the south 
wall. On the eastern wall is another large double door.

The Carriage House~
   This large room, more of a barn really, is a warehouse for the 
storage associated with the stable. Wagons and carts are parked 
in neat rows here. Bins and racks on the perimeter of the room 
hold tack, harness, and barding. Sacks of grain are stacked in 
one corner. A ladder is nailed to a wall, leading up to a loft 
above. Lanterns hang from the beams above, shedding a soft 
light.

made of slanted slats built into the north and south ends of the 
room allow for ventilation. The tops of wagons and carts can be 
seen below. The room beneath is reached by the use of a ladder

Rath Belthias Between the Stable and the Warehouse~
   The dirt street here is heavily rutted by the passage of 
heavily-laden wagons carrying materials to and from the buildings 
that line its length. The two-story section of the village 
stable raises above the street to the west. Eastward lies the 
side of a warehouse built of logs, which is relatively large 
compared to most the small, rough construction of the village. 
Rath Belthias meets with Rath Fangird to the north.

Rath Fangird Passing the Stable~
   The dirt street here is heavily rutted by the passage of 
heavily-laden wagons. To the south has been built a long stable, 
the final third of the building rising up two stories. Tall 
wooden doors allow a mounted teamster to drive large wagon 
inside. Along the north side of the street is the side of the 
Vanguard Mess Hall, frequented at all hours by soldiers and 
civilians alike as they prepare for or come off of duty. The 
Anduin Gate of the village can be seen to the west.

Rath Nissah Passing the Mess Hall~
   This is the heaviest traveled street in the village, for on 
the eastern side is the door to the long,low mess hall building 
made of birch logs. The sound of loud, rugged soldiers and 
villagers at table spills into the street at all times of the day 
or night. Overhead, watchful men in the uniform of the Eastern 
Vanguard pace along the wooden parapet of the tall log walls that 
rise along the western side of the street.

Beside the Training Grounds~
   Curses and shouts mix with the ring and thump of weapons on 
metal and leather as men strive against each other in the open 
field to the east of this portion of Rath Nissah. Tall walls 
rise to the west, made of heavy, fire-hardened logs sharpened at 
the top and set on end side by side. Armed men patrol the tops 
of the walls, ever watchful.

The Northern End of Rath Nissah~
   The heavy log walls of the village turn sharply to the east as 
the dirt street, marked by the passage of many boots, comes to an 
end. An obstacle course for the training of soldiers has been 
set up on the eastern side of the street, and at any time of the 
day or night sweating men attack the various obstacles with 
grunts of effort and curses of pain. Above on the walls, men in 
the colors of the Eastern Vanguard pace watchfully, ever 
watchful.

The Northern End of a Training Field~
   Bordered on the north edge by the patrolled log walls of the 
village, this end of an empty lot has been set up for the 
training of soldiers. Various pieces of equipment are scattered 
about, all nearly constantly in use by villagers and soldiers 
alike. The southern end of the lot is clear of equipment save 
for weapon racks. To the east is an empty lot. A channel passes 
through a grated opening in the wall, bringing a fast-running 
stream of clean water from the Anduin, which runs along the 
eastern edge of the field.

The Southern End of a Training Field~
North of the chow hall, a large empty lot has been set aside 
for the training of soldiers. In the southern section, men 
strive against each other in spars at all times of the day and 
night, though it is most heavily in use during the early evening. 
Those not so engaged offer advice and taunts to the combatants, 
as easily hooting in derision as cheering an effort. The 
northern end of the field is littered with various pieces of 
equipment. To the east is an empty lot.

The Mess Hall~
   A long building of logs contains a large open room filled with 
boisterous soldiers at their meals. Shelves and barrels contain 
various food offerings replenished from the kitchen to the south. 
A sign hangs upon a plain wooden door leading to the east, and a 
heavy door to the west leads to the street outside. The northern 
side of the dining hall seems to be the most popular, probably 
because of the large window that looks out upon the sparring 
grounds, and cheers or hoots of derision often erupt from the 
tables there. The northeast corner has been recently walled off 
to make a small office. A sign hangs on the eastern door.

A Brightly Lit Infirmary~
   The floor of this room is made of flagstones cut from the 
nearby quarry, shaped into squares and mortared together. The 
walls are white-painted pine planks, as is the ceiling. Lamps 
are spaced at equal distances along the walls, providing good 
light for the procedures that are carried out here. The 
southeast and northwest corners have been walled off to form 
small chambers inside the larger room. A wide door to the south 
leads to the street outside, and another door to the north barely 
clears a set of stairs built along the wall there.

The Mess Hall Kitchen~
   This kitchen is strictly no-frills, made solely for the 
purpose of producing large quantities of food daily. The walls 
are lined with sturdy shelves and bins containing supplies and 
utensils. The stoves are in heavy use, and even in the coldest 
winter this room is warm, and it is oppressively hot in the 
summer. Windows on the south and west walls about can be opened 
to provide ventilation. A recessed iron ring attached to a 
trapdoor is visible on the floor against the southernmost wall. 
A swinging door on the eastern wall leads to a storeroom for 
prepared foods.

Rath Fangird Crossing a Bridge~
   A strong bridge of wooden beams provides passage across the 
deep, narrow channel that brings water from the Anduin through 
the village of Amdir. A small stone cistern has been constructed 
by the channel's edge to hold water for the use of the villagers. 
The two-story section of the stable is upon the southern side of 
the street, and to the north is the wide door of the infirmary. 
An intersection lies further to the east, and at a distance to 
the west can be seen a heavy gate set in the tall log walls of 
the village.

   Though Rath Fangird, as it continues on, is still somewhat 
rutted, the majority of the deepest ruts seem to turn south here 
onto a street lined with large, sturdy buildings and covered work 
areas. Rath Fangird continues eastward past a rugged-looking 
tavern and the trading post, and westward past the infirmary, 
stable, and mess hall. A sign is planted upon the northeastern 
corner, facing west.

Rath Fangird East of an Intersection~
   The deeply rutted surface of Rath Fangird passes a path to a 
cabin, the White Hart visible just to its north. The log walls 
of a large warehouse block access to the south. A bit to the 
east can be seen the small village square, and the dirt street 
continues westward past an intersection to cross a wooden bridge.

Rath Petris Nears an Intersection~
   The traffic on Rath Petris seems to include few wagons, for 
the dirt street is relatively free of the deep ruts common in 
other parts of the village. It stretches northward from a 
relatively busy intersection, passing by a large lot to the east 
that has been marked out with small stones piled at each corner. 
The tall wall of the infirmary rises to the west. 
   On the eastern side of the street, a large sign of a well
painted White Hart hangs from a pole sticking out to one side of
a door, with the noises of patrons talking and drinking.

Rath Belthias Before the Woodworking Shop~
   The woodshop on the west side of the road is barely long 
enough to hold the huge logs that are brought in on mule carts 
throughout the day. The sounds of milling and chopping fill the 
street from dawn till dusk. The building to the east is larger, 
a warehouse built of logs that stretches north to Rath Fangird 
and south the same distance. The doors of both buildings are 
tall and wide enough to allow the passage of heavily laden 
wagons.

A Cluttered Sawmill~
   The buzz of the sawmill is deafening. This complex piece of 
machinery is a mass of metal cogs, wheels and sawblades, driven 
by a shaft protruding through the back wall of the building 
beside a small porthole. The smell of oil and water used to cool 
the blades mixes with the strong smells of the wood chips which 
cover the floor. Logs and long lengths of cut timber lie strewn 
all over the room, only the area around the sawmill itself is 
free of these obstacles. A lift has been built along the 
northern wall to carry men and materials to and from the workroom 
above.

workbench takes up the entire northern wall of this room,

the passage of heavily laden wagons. A small, open forge has 
been erected on the western side of the street, protected by a 
slate roof raised on stout, roughly squared beams. In the rear 
of the lot sits a small log shed. The large, windowless log

   Rath Belthias comes to an end against the tall southern wall 
of the village. Above, armored men wearing the uniform of 
Pel-Dagor troops patrol along the top of the log wall on a narrow 
walk. The Amdir gaol on the east side of the dirt street the 
only stone building on Rath Belthias, built of materials carved 
from local deposits. It is a small, squat structure, with a 
small opening on each side of the door, barely large enough to be 
called windows. The openings are covered with a crisscross 
webbing made of thick, flat iron bars. Two guards before the 
heavy door keep an eye on the street in general as well as 
keeping the curious away from the cell windows. To the west is 
an area covered by a thatched roof raised on sturdy log supports. 
The strong odors here are very unpleasant.

An Outdoor Smithy~
   Posts rise at intervals along the work area, lifting a slanted 
slate roof to provide some protection from the elements to the 
eastern section of the lot. A few stray lanterns, shuttered 
against wind and elements, have been set among the many crates 
and other surfaces redolent in the clutter which inhabits this 
area. Still, they provide an adequate measure of light though it 
is not the brightest of areas. Shadows fall from the many 
barrels, straps, horseshoes, hammers, picks, shovels, shelves and 
other worn items cluttering up the space. A small shed of logs 
has been built by the stream that runs along the western end of 
the lot. Upon its door hangs a round sign bearing the heraldry 
of Lord Eradan.

An Ill-smelling Covered Work Area~
   A thatched roof has been raised on rough-hewn posts above a 
cluttered work area, reaching to the edge of a deep channel 
carying a strong-running stream of not particularly clean water 
southward through a strong grate through the heavy wall of the 
fort. Across the channel, a rough rail fence keeps horses 
working in the field beyond from the unclean water. From the 
rafters, hides stretched on frames hang in varying states of 
drying. The odor is extremely unpleasant here, the stench of 
curing hides mixed with the fumes produced from the smithy to the 
north. A small storage shed has been built under the 
northwestern corner of the shelter.

A Small Prison Yard~
The stone walls are quite high here, and smooth to make 
climbing difficult. Such activity is further discouraged by the 
crossbowman atop the northern cell, and the patrolling soldiers 
atop Amdir's walls are always watchful as well. The dusty yard 
is only about ten feet by fifteen feet. A small stone bench has 
been anchored to the ground in the center of the yard. Three cells are 
placed around the yard, each with barred windows in their heavy doors.

Beside the Channel ~
   A small log shed sits in a narrow strip of ground beneath the 
raised slate roof over the smithy area and a deep, narrow channel 
that has been dug to bring a strong-flowing stream of water 
through the village of Amdir. The water is not very clean at 
this point in its journey. One can see that it is separated by a 
rough rail fence from a field used for training horses on the 
other side. The door of the cabin bears a circular wooden plaque 
bearing the moon and shield heraldry of Lord Eradan. Light 
spills from a lantern sitting by the stool of the man who guards 
the cabin entrance.

The White Hart Tavern~
   Warm, yet dim lighting from sparsely placed candles, sconces 
and more common windows keeps this room comfortable and cozy. 
The walls are stained a rich brown, with the ceiling's own 
coloration almost imperceptible, it being hidden in murky 
shadows. A polished bar extends along the northern wall, with 
large cabinets suspended behind it. From a rack over the bar 
tankards, glasses and cups hang, each more or less cleaned. The 
floor is worn, and in some spots uneven, yet quite sturdy. A 
floorboard or two creeks with weight upon it, but for the most 
part, the acoustics of the room swallow sounds quickly. Over the 
wall opposite the bar stand numerous trophies, each posed so as 
to make it as fearsome as possible. The door to the western end 
of the room is heavy and thick, drawing emphasis to just where 
this tavern is located, and through it a trickle of soldiers, 
citizens and visitors persists. The room is generally filled 
with gentle conversation and muted laughter.

Rath Petris Passing the Fellows' House~
   To the west side of the street, the tall infirmary building 
continues from the south, but on the east lies a door set into a 
long building made of logs. A circular plaque hangs upon the 
door, bearing the black and grey heraldry of Lord Eradan in the 
center. Around the edges of the plaque are inscribed the emblems 
of each Fellowship of Minas Tirith. The building stretches 
northward to end against the walls of the village.

The Foyer of the White Hart Tavern~
   Running long along a west to east line, this room is poorly 
lit, and fairly drafty. Windows and sparse sconces provide the 
lighting, and are placed far apart, allowing for deep shadows to 
be cast about the room. The door is just to the side of the 
southeast corner, with hooks lining the wall next to it. The 
floor is worn, with a clear path winding from the door towards 
the end of the foyer to the west. Few patrons choose to linger 
in this room, moving instead for the company, warmth and drink in 
the tavern proper.

The floor is wooden, and covered with a simple though sturdy blue 
rug. Two sconces on the walls keep the small space very well 
lit, and a window on the east looks out onto Rath Petris. The 
door set in the northern wall has a sliding panel in it, about 
five feet off the floor. A sturdier door in the west wall leads 
out to the dirt street beyond.

The Northern End of Rath Petris~
   Rath Petris ends against the tall northern walls of the 
village. High atop the walls, armed men wearing the heraldry of 
the Eastern Vanguard patrol watchfully on narrow platforms build 
inside the thick, fire-hardened logs that form the village walls. 
To the east a long, low log building stretches southward from the 
wall. An empty lot lies to the west, its borders laid out by 
small piles of stones on the four corners.

A Fenced Garden Beside a Training Yard~
   This portion of the garden is fenced on the east side from 
Rath Petris, which runs southward toward the centre of the 
village, the fence extending to the corner of the infirmary to 
the south. On its north side it is bordered by the tall walls of 
the village, and a deep, narrow channel flows through an iron 
grate, separating the area from the training yard to the east.

A Fenced Garden Behind the Infirmary~
   This is a small garden behind the infirmary that is fenced off 
on the east side from the Rath that runs north and south, just 
across from the Fellowship Housing on that side. It is also 
fenced on the north from the rest of the lot that stretches still 
farther northward, the fence there extending to the back corner 
of the office from the nearest corner of the outer infirmary 
wall. Rich, earthen scents mingle with the stronger odors of lye 
and other elements in this area, but the din from the infirmary 
itself and the Mess Hall beyond are muffled here.

The Southern End of a Narrow Hallway~
   The walls of this hallway are paneled with white-painted pine. 
The floor is made of pine planks sanded smooth and stained. 
Doors are set into both the east and west walls and the hallway 
continues northward. Upon the west wall is drawn a numeral one, 
and on the east, a two. A sconce beside each door casts good 
light in the hallway. The southern door has a narrow sliding 
panel set about five feet off the floor. At all times the door 
is manned by a young apprentice from one of the several 
fellowships represented in Amdir.

Rath Fangird Nears the Village Square~
   The deeply rutted surface of Rath Fangird passes a lot to the 
north, empty save for a large, durable canvas tent that has been 
pitched there. The log walls of the trading post are to the 
south. Approaching a small village square to the east, the 
street nears its end. 
   On the northern side of the street, a large sign of a well
painted White Hart hangs from a pole sticking out to one side of
a door, with the noises of patrons talking and drinking.

Lon's Village Square~
   This small round bit of grass at center of the meeting of four 
streets is bounded by flagstones made of the local rock. A wide 
walkway of the same material leads to the center of the tended 
park, ending in a carefully laid out stone-filled circle. To the 
north and south of that are two circles of tilled earth, bordered 
by stone, each about four feet wide.

Northward on Rath Kantor~
   Rath Kantor stretches northward past a medium-sized cabin on 
the east, running along an otherwise empty lot on the eastern 
side until it ends at the tall northern wall of the village of 
Amdir. Most of what can be seen of the village east of here is 
empty lots and streets laid out for future growth, while to the 
west rise several sturdy buildings of rough logs.

grassy area at the heart of Amdir. To the east, small lots have 
been laid out, but are mostly unbuilt. To the west lies the 
small crowd of log buildings that compose what has been built of 
the outpost. The trading post is on Rath Folco, making it one of 
the busiest streets in the village.

barely marked by passage after passing the trading post. To the 
east sits a small building made of rough-cut logs, a wooden sign 
hanging over its plain door. Northward lies the circle about the

   This is a wide breezeway between the Buyer's Office to the 
north and the General Store to the south, formed by the 
contiguous roof that covers both buildings. The log outer walls 
of the buildings form a passageway wide enough for two heavy 
wagons to park side by side and yet leave room for pedestrian 
traffic. A heavy, iron-banded door to the west bears a plaque 
displaying the shield and moon heraldry of Lord Eradan below a 
small barred window.

The Amdir Buyer~
   Though this log building is quite large, the front office here 
is rather small, with just space enough for the roomy counter. 
It is an official-looking place, with a plaque bearing the White 
Tree of Gondor and another bearing Lord Eradan's heraldry hanging 
on the wall, one on each side of the iron-banded door behind the 
counter. Two lanterns hang over the counter, providing excellent 
light for the examination of ores and furs. On the counter sits 
a balance, with a small set of weights and a magnifying lens.

Amdir General Store~
   This is a small general store. No effort has been made to 
finish the floors or walls, or to disguise its identity as a 
building made of rough logs. Every bit of wall space is covered 
with shelves, and the floor is covered with barrels, crates, and 
bins, all filled with an astonishing variety of goods, everything 
from farm implements to flour, not always sorted in any way that 
seems to make sense. The proprietor, however, can retrieve 
anything at an instant's notice. Most regular patrons do not 
bother digging through the clutter and prefer to just tell him 
what they want, which he will speedily fetch and place on the 
counter. Even though several lanterns hang from the beams above, 
the light seems inadequate, and there is a comfortable sort of 
dimness over everything which gives this store a homey, worn 
feeling despite its obviously new construction.

   This is a large empty lot, bordered on the south by the tall 
log walls of the village, and by dirt streets on the other three 
sides. It is still in its native state, save for the presence of 
a few fresh stumps. Except for a small log building on the 
northwestern corner, there is no construction at all upon this 
lot, though there is room for perhaps another five small cabins.

far in the village, while to the east most the lots that have

   The lightly traveled dirt street passes between large empty 
lots on either side to come up against the northern wall of the 
village. Tall logs, set on end and sharpened, stand side by side 
in sturdy protection against the threat of the wilderness 
outside. Above, armored men wearing the black and grey of Lord 
Eradan watchfully patrol on a narrow walkway built along the 
inside of the walls, which can be reached by means of a strong 
ladder fastened to the rising logs.

side, sanded relatively smooth. The open-beamed roof is slanted 
from west to east, a few lanterns hanging from the rafters. The 
stove in the center of the room provides some warmth on cold 
days.

heavily traveled street. The lot to the east is a narrow strip 
of land, with room for two or three small cabins. The lot to the 
west is perhaps twice as large.

Rath Ronald Nears an Intersection to the East~
   Rath Ronald passes between large empty lots on its way to the 
eastern gate which opens onto the wilderness. To the west, the 
street circles the village square. The dirt shows signs of heavy 
traffic as marching soldiers and intrepid settlers alike venture 
into the dangerous lands beyond the walls.

Rath Ronald At an Intersection~
   Rath Ronald crosses two untraveled dirt streets on its way to 
the eastern gate which opens onto the wilderness. Rath Ewan 
leads northward and Rath Erynion south. This part of the village 
is unused at the moment, consisting of empty lots that have been 
cleared and lie waiting for settlers to put to use.

   Rath Ewan runs along between two empty pieces of cleared 
ground, each large enough for a couple of small log cabins. The 
street travels the short distance from Rath Ronald to the south 
to the tall village walls to the north, where armed men patrol 
watchfully on the top of the walls.

   A narrow strip of land between Rath Ewan and the eastern walls 
is large enough for two or perhaps three very small cabins, and 
exends north of this point. The ground here is in its natural 
state, save for a tree stump here or there. Above, soldiers 
patrol on a wooden platform built inside the tall walls of the 
village. Rath Ronald to the south arrives at the Wilderness 
Gate.

Rath Ronald Before the Wilderness Gate~
   The heavy timber gate that leads out into Ithilien is heavily 
guarded by grim armored men wearing the black and grey of Lord 
Eradan. More such men patrol above or stand guard over the 
murder hole before the gate. To the north and south of the dirt 
street which leads west into the village center are empty lots, 
each big enough for two or three small cabins. 
   Above, archers can be heard patrolling the walls. A small 
shutter has been cut into the gate, with a slider in place for 
looking out.

On a Narrow Walkway on the Northern Wall~
   The walls of Amdir are two stories high, and this narrow 
wooden walkway has been built inside them along the top for the 
use of the patrolling soldiers. The broad sharpened ends of the 
fire-hardened logs are about waist high on most the soldiers 
here. From this vantage point, it is obvious that the village is 
built upon a promontory extending into the Anduin river, 
surrounded on three sides by the mighty waters. Only to the east 
do the walls look out onto more than a narrow strip of land.

beautiful, dangerous and full of rich resources to be harvested 
by those with the courage to dare its hazards. A heavy iron 
winch pulls chains through its maw to open and close the gates

At the Base of Amdir's Northern Walls~
   A very narrow, barely navigable strip of small, river-smoothed 
stones between sharp-edged boulders forms the steep banks of the 
promontory upon which Amdir has been built. The mighty Anduin 
struggles against the stone, reluctantly diverted around the 
outcropping. The tall logs of the fortress rise above, patrolled 
by watchful, well armored soldiers wearing the cloaks of the 
Pel-Dagor and Pel-Tirith. Unreachable from this point, but 
visible, a cliff rises to the east, with a treacherous path 
leading halfway down its face.

struggles against the stone, reluctantly diverted around the

The Northwestern Edge of the Cape ~
   A very narrow, barely navigable strip of small, river-smoothed 
stones between sharp-edged boulders forms the steep northern 
banks of the promontory upon which Amdir has been built. It 
curves gently southward here. The mighty Anduin struggles 
against the stone, reluctantly diverted around the outcropping. 
A wide flat piece of land to the south has been turned into an 
archery range, and the dock lies to the southwest. The great 
stone ediface of Cair Andros rises from the depths of the river 
to the west, its southern face bearing formidable fortifications.

The Southwestern Edge of the Promontory~
   A very narrow, barely navigable strip of small, river-smoothed 
stones between sharp-edged boulders forms the steep southern 
banks of the promontory upon which Amdir has been built. It 
curves gently northward here. The mighty Anduin struggles 
against the stone, reluctantly diverted around the outcropping. 
A dock lies to the northwest. The great stone edifice of Cair 
Andros rises from the depths of the river to the west, its 
southern face bearing formidable fortifications.

At the Base of Amdir's Southern Walls~
   A very narrow, barely navigable strip of small, river-smoothed 
stones between sharp-edged boulders forms the steep banks of the 
promontory upon which Amdir has been built. East of this spot, 
the connection to the land has been rendered purposely impassible 
by chiseling the rock to be vertical from the walls above it. 
The mighty Anduin struggles against the stone, reluctantly 
diverted around the outcropping. The tall logs of the fortress 
rise above, patrolled by watchful, well armored soldiers wearing 
the black or green cloaks of the Eastern Vanguard.

A Dirt Path Beside Rath Kantor~
   A path leads eastward to a simple two-story cabin, which has 
been constructed of squared logs chinked with clay. Its sturdy 
door faces out onto Rath Kantor, as do four small glass windows, 
two on each floor. The path branches off southward toward a 
similar, somewhat smaller cabin, and then northward to run 
parallel to the road beside it.

A Cozy Great Room~
   Rough hewn logs, sanded smooth and pieced tightly together 
make up the walls of this standard great-room that combines 
kitchen, living and dining space into a single room. The ceiling 
is formed of log beams which support the flooring for the rooms 
overhead, while the floor is formed of sanded and waxed planks. 
Although the space is far from large, it is cunningly compact 
with shelves lining one wall and the pantry and cupboard tucked 
into the corners near the stove to make a functional little 
kitchen space. A single window of thick and wavy glass lets in 
outside daylight from beside the stout door that comprises the 
main entrance to the cabin. The whole room is heated and lit by 
the single broad stone fireplace. A simple, soft, dark green rug 
invitingly covers the section of floor facing the hearth. The 
golden glow of the wood surrounding reflects both fire and 
sunlight, making the whole space seem filled with clean, fresh, 
and hearty light. A second door leads northwards, barely 
clearing the narrow but sturdy set of stairs that butts up 
against the northern wall.

A Small Bedroom~
Small and cozy, this room is of comfortable size for a bedroom. Lanterns
hang high on hooks on the walls, casting a warm glow from the rough hewn
and well sanded wood of the walls, offering plenty of light for writing
or reading. Wide beams support the ceiling overhead and the scent of cut
wood pervades with its healthy and heady odor. The floor underfoot
consists of logs that have been planed and sanded and waxed to a shining
and smooth, faintly reflective surface.

A Tiny Landing~
   This room is but a narrow space between two doors atop a 
narrow set of stairs leading downward. The landing is not 
centered in the cabin, being closer to the south end than the 
north. The floor is made of hewn logs sanded smooth, and covered 
with a small woven rug.

A Loft Bedroom~
   The larger room of this good sized loft is clean and fresh, 
the hewn logs sanded and exuding the scent of cut wood. 
Simplicity rules the space in quiet comfort. A small window 
allows sunlight to cross the floor through the thick glass pane 
in the afternoons. The ceiling angles sharply with the eaves of 
the cabin, but there is sufficient space at the apex for even a 
tall man to stand. Comfortable and warm, heated from the main 
room below, this living and sleeping space is singularly 
inviting. A woven, multi-hued rug covers a portion of the waxed 
golden-hued flooring, muffling creaks and providing warm padding 
for bare feet.

A Small Bedroom in the loft~
   The smaller room of the loft is as finished as the larger one, 
with flooring and beamed ceiling. The slope of the roof is sharp 
in here, but that only augments the sense of being cradled in the 
the warmth of the sanded logs that make up the walls and beams of 
this cabin. The floor has been waxed to a golden glow and is 
partially covered by a brightly-colored red and blue woven rug. 
A small window peeks out from the eaves, letting natural light 
in. The warmth from the main rooms below rises up to this cozy, 
simple sleeping space.

   No one has bothered to finish the walls of this small room, 
built simply to hold storage for the laboratory to the west. The 
east and south walls are just the rough squared logs that make up 
the building. The other two walls are simply unfinished pine 
planking. The floor is the same grey slate as that of the lab.

walls are white-painted blocks of the same stone, and section off 
an area barely six feet square. A tiny window, about a foot

that someone in a cot can look out. Another small window is 
built into the door. A set of manacles are mounted at the

   This is a small archer's platform atop the northern cell of

An Empty Small Shopfront~
   The door barely clears the counter inside this small room. 
With the unfinished walls and floor, all made of the same 
roughly-squared pine logs, there is a pleasant smell to the 
place, and the lantern hanging from a rafter over the counter 
sheds a warm, golden light. Clearly the walls once sported small 
boxes, though now only the markings remain.

The Southern End of Rath Folco~
   Rath Folco ends here, its surface barely marked by passage 
save for a path worn deeper in the dirt street by the passages of 
heavy boots leading to a ladder against the walls to the south, 
leading up to the walkway overhead. To the east, an empty lot 
with room for several small cabins extends from the wall to Rath 
Ronald, and between Rath Folco and the next street over, not even 
divided into sections by the piles of stones common throughout 
the village. The log walls of the trading post on the west side 
of the street run from the fortress wall northward.

A Small Storeroom~
   This is a small, empty room with small cubbyholes made of thin 
wood on the eastern wall. The area is well lit by lanterns

Inside a Large Tent~
   The trunks of young trees have been cut and lashed together, 
bark still on, to form a sturdy frame over which undyed canvas 
has been stretched to form a boxy tent. The floor is simply 
wooden planks laid side by side upon the earth. A few lanterns 
hang from crossties above mismatched tables, at which settlers 
and off-duty soldiers share drinks and tales. A sheet of thick 
cotton cloth has been hung to divide off the eastern section of 
the tent.

A Tidy, Cramped Workroom~
   The lingering scent of cooked food mingles with the 
musty-sweet scent of fermentation in this workroom, that appears 
to be slightly newer than the room through the heavy door to the 
south. The floor's planks bear a slight sheen and are neatly 
kept at all times, and the wooden counters lining the northern 
and western wall bear a slightly worn, scrubbed appearance. 
Against the eastern wall, a brewing area has been set up, beside 
which is a curtain leading into an even smaller room, and an oven 
has been built into the southern wall.

A Stone Dock~
   Standing on the small ferry dock, the sense of the looming 
mass of Cair Andros bears down on arrivals. The dock is made of 
heavy stone blocks some are new and squared and clean, while 
heavy stone blocks some are new and squared and clean, while 
others seem ancient, their corners rounded or crumbling or even 
broken away. The cliff face above is not sheer, but ragged and 
covered with boulders and jagged outcrops. Signs of bombardment 
are eveywhere, great chunks of the stone broken and fallen to
form precarious piles perched on narrow ledges below. Here and 
there some form of plant life has managed to find a purchase. A 
narrow starcase winds its torturous way upward toward a few 
whitewashed stone buildings improbably clinging to the cliff face 
above. 
   A steep ramp has been carved out of the cliff face next to the 
steps so wagons and carts and horses can reach the fortress. 
Bridges stretch off east and west across the wide bend of the
Anduin here as it begins to surge back southwards into a single 
river. 
   A path leads into the woods of Cair Andros to the north.

At the Bottom of a Treacherous Staircase~
   Steps have been hewn from the living stone of Cair Andros. 
They exhibit no consistency in any dimension, so one must keep 
one's eyes upon one's feet at every move. The climb is steep and 
at times one feels nearly as if they should use their hands as 
well, though it is barely not necessary. The small dock below is 
a stubby finger of stone extending to the river. Above is more 
of the treacherous staircase, On a ledge nearby, visible but 
unreachable, defenses have been erected. A steep ramp rises here
from the docks below, carved out for horses and wagons.

across to the west here, gaining little elevation as it veers

harrowing than many other sections of the ascent, though the view

section of stair joins up with the old as it twists back west and 
nears a gatehouse above. Broken remnants of the old stairs are

this ledge, half natural, half carved from the cliff face. A 
massive, ancient gatehouse looms to the east, its surface covered 
with signs of centuries of combat, cracks and pits repaired with 
fresh stone and mortar. Grim soldiers peer down from overhead, 
clad in the armor and heraldry of the Eastern Vanguard. At the 
southern edge of this ledge is nothing but air before the 
boulders at the base of the island, washed by the mighty Anduin's 
inexorable current.

Inside a Massive Gatehouse~
   Carved within an outcropping of stone, this chamber has been 
skillfully hewed, the interior surfaces are smooth and polished. 
The area inside, is watched by soldiers stationed in a guard post 
high overhead through a series of small murderholes which can 
also be used to fire upon anyone here. A small shutter set in 
the gate allows one to peer inside. The floor of the gatehouse 
is kept clean and orderly though it is marked with dark red 
stains.

Between Two Massive Gatehouses~
   The stone ledge is fairly wide here, bordered by a heavy, 
iron- bound gate and an iron portcullis. A narrow tunnel, its 
access blocked by a rusty gate, leads downwards. A narrow stair 
made of rope and planks leads upwards apparently leading to a 
whitewashed, windowless structure that clings improbably to the 
face of the cliff. Far below, the waters of the Anduin continue 
their journey southwards.

case of alarm, and the doors to either side are unusually wide as

Behind the Enlisted Barracks~
   There is not much room between the northern side of the 
barracks and the raw stone of the island rising to the next ledge 
above. Very little light reaches in here, so nothing grows 
besides lichen and moss clinging to the stones of both the 
building and the cliff. A few loose rocks lay about that have 
been knocked down from above.

Walkway Along a Narrow Ledge Above a Gatehouse~

stout, well-seasoned planks, timbers, and thick rope continues 
along the cliffside, replacing a fractured, impassable pathway 
that had been carved out of the stone of the cliff itself. 
Stairs branch off downwards and access is gained here to another

worn, and some areas are recently repaired with clean grey stone 
harvested nearby. A hole in the middle of the floor looks down 
into the gatehouse, allowing an array of defenses to be brought

Rope and Plank Walkway Before a Structure on the Cliffside~
   The natural ledge here has been widened by hard labor, the 
cliff face pushed back to make room for a two-story stone 
building, most of which seems to be carved back into the stone. 
A steep stair leads up to its door. On the east side of the 
building's lower floor, a balcony extends out, supporting poles 
flying the flags of Gondor and Lord Eradan, and the penants of 
the divisions of the Eastern Vanguard.

Rope and Plank Walkway Below a Tower~
   The ledge ends here below a stark, squat tower perched at the 
peak of the island. A tunnel has been cut into the stone to the 
west, covered with a rusty gate. A wooden dock clings to the 
cliff face to the south, where a large heavy crane is mounted to 
the stone. The ledge slopes steeply downward to the east.

A Narrow Hallway Lined with Doors~
   Several shields, hung prominently upon the thick timbered 
walls, stand out in this narrow hallway. The high, sloped 
ceiling holds a single, simple chandelier, bathing the room in 
warm light. A carpet covers the entire area of the floor, the 
scenes of battle depicted upon it not countering the warmth its 
presence brings. A sigil has been carved upon the western door.

A Finely Finished, Yet Spartan Bed Chamber~
   This compact chamber has been cut from the very stone of the 
island, worked till extrememly smooth and polished to a high 
sheen. The room though finely furnished still presents a spartan 
beauty. The smooth floor is covered with a thick warm rug, a 
tapestry bearing a scene of armored men adorns the west wall. A 
fair sized fireplace has been set in the northern wall and a 
thick curtain leads to a balcony built into the eastern wall.

Well-lit Office Carved from the Rock~
   A portion of this chamber has been carved from the stone of 
the Island, the surfaces worked until smooth, polished. The rest 
of it has been constructed of stout timber and lumber that 
extends beyond the cliff. The chamber is somewhat isolated from 
the busier portions of the fortress, a thick oaken trapdoor 
shutting out the activity. A small fireplace has been set in the 
western wall with an opening to a balcony to the east. The floor 
is covered with a thick, warm rug and the remaining wall space is 
mostly bare. A large table dominates the room, its surface 
usually covered with maps and other such documents.

A Narrow Ledge Before the Barracks Door~
   This is a somewhat precarious, narrow piece of ledge, before a 
heavy door in a whitewashed, windowless building that clings 
improbably to the south face of the cliff far above the river. 
There are several small slits high upon the door, and though most 
the building looks ancient, there are patches that are obviously 
recently repaired. The narrow ledge leads onto the top of an 
ancient, massive gatehouse.

A Narrow Hallway Lined with Doors~
   Several shields, hung prominently upon the thick timbered 
walls, stand out in this narrow hallway. The high, sloped 
ceiling holds a single, simple chandelier, bathing the room in 
warm light. A carpet covers the entire area of the floor, the 
scenes of battle depicted upon it not countering the warmth its 
presence brings. Sigils have been carved upon each of the doors.

A Broken Crane Mounted High on the Precipice~
   A ledge has been augmented with strong wooden timbers to 
provide something of a dock hanging over the river far below. A 
great construction of iron and wood has been built here, fastened 
securely to the stone. Thick rope feeds through it and, by means 
of a heavy iron hook, fastens to six chains that attach to a 
heavy wooden platform dangling out over the edge of the ledge, 
either at a level with it or else far below by the dock. 
   Recent storm damage has destroyed most of the workings of this 
lift. It is inoperable.

Upon the Lift Platform~
The lift platform consists of thick planks laid over a strong, 
rectangular timber frame. Heavy iron eyebolts are driven through 
planks and timber at the four corners and the middles of the long 
sides. Six chains are hooked to the eyebolts one one end and to 
a thick iron ring on the other, their lengths cut so that the 
ring rises above the exact center of the platform to mate with 
the hook on the end of the crane's heavy rope.

Aboard the 'Homeward Bound', Moored to the Amdir Dock~
   This is a single-masted ship, shallow and broad, her wide deck 
cleared to allow the transport of up to a score of armored men 
standing shoulder to shoulder. The boom is purposely high, 
though the very tallest of men or elves may need to duck their 
heads a little when it swings about. The railing is formed of 
waist-high posts with a single rope run through holes bored 
through the tops. There is a short bowsprit to allow a small 
jib. A long steering oar at the stern is manned by the master, 
and there are two sailors to handle the lines and sail. A hatch, 
smooth with the deck, opens to reveal the area under the deck, 
which is only about five feet high, and partially filled with 
sandbags for ballast. It is suitable for the transport of 
wounded or equipment. The ship is old and seems oft-patched, 
though she is lovingly maintained.

In the Hold of the 'Homeward Bound'~
   This is a cramped hold, barely five feet high, which smells of 
tar and mildew. The bones of the boat creak and groan. The 
floor of the hold is simply planking laid across supports 
fastened to the ribs of the boat on either side before they 
finally narrow dramatically to form the keel, and can be taken up 
to tend to the bilge. Sandbags are piled about for ballast, and 
a small pile below the hatch make it easier to get in and out.

2.  Some way to get the money back for items turned in due to promotion or retirement, because we would recycle armor but these progs issue full sets.  The armory quickly becomes full of mismatched armor, which means we need more rooms and it's a pain anyway.

At the Top of a Rusty Ladder in a Narrow Tunnel~
   A rusty ladder rattles as it is climbed upon, the bolts 
fastening it into the stone loosened by rust and age. The tunnel 
has been carved with no eye for anything save making a hole 
through the rock, and jagged edges reach to score the flesh at 
every step. The rungs are slick with moisture, and the rust on 
them abrades unprotected hands. The sound of the river is loud, 
seeming to resonate in the tunnel, beating against the stone and 
the ears. The upper end of the ladder ends at a metal framed 
trapdoor barely big enough for an armored man's shoulders to fit 
through, and the lower descends into the darkness.

In the Middle of a Narrow Lot~
   A narrow strip of land between Rath Ewan and the eastern walls 
is large enough for two or perhaps three very small cabins, and 
exends north and south of this point. The ground here is in its 
natural state, save for a tree stump here or there. Above, 
soldiers patrol on a wooden platform built inside the tall walls 
of the village.

   A small cabin has been built against the tall northern wall, 
with a solid door facing a dirt walkway that meets a somewhat 
wider path running past. Here it extends in from the east, 
curving southward to run parallel to the road beside it.

A Large Lot on Rath Ewan~
   This is an empty lot, bordered on the north by the tall log 
walls of the village, and by a dirt street on the other three 
sides. Upon the southwestern corner sits a medium-sized cabin 
built of logs. There is room for perhaps five more small cabins 
on the lot, which is still in its native state, save for the 
presence of a few fresh stumps.

A Fire Ring Near the Village Center~
   The settlers, or perhaps the engineers, have built a fire ring 
in an empty corner of a lot near a large stump which is obviously 
much older than the village. Logs have been pulled in to act as 
benches. A few large rocks and stumps also serve. To the south 
is the settlement's tavern, and the village center is to the 
southeast. A long low building is to the north, and another just 
west of that. The grass and other growth has been worn away in a 
path around the fire ring, proof that the small retreat was once 
popular with the folk who live here.

   The deck of the caravel is about twenty yards long and nearly 
six wide. Triangular black sails are set upon long yards mounted 
at an angle upon the two masts. The entire surface of the 
largest is covered with an intricate, stylized White Tree. A 
line leading from the aft tip of the rear spar down to the 
sterncastle flies a grey and black pennant bearing the heraldry 
of Lord General Eradan. A railing of thick rope threaded through 
sturdy posts runs the perimeter of the deck.

Spreading to the east of the dock, you see the wooded, rolling terrain of Ithilien. Southwards the white cliffs of the Emyn Arnen rise, causing the mighty Anduin to veer sharply to the west. As the ship approaches the wooden dock, it smoothly slows, coming to a stop just before the wooden structure, the activity aboard her becoming almost hectic, heavy ropes being used to secure the craft to the dock. Finally, the boarding ramp descends, coming to rest with a thud.  The captain announces he will wait only a short while before securing his ship again.

The stout wooden pier extends into the river from a huge rock that rises from the prairie spreading to the east, banners of the Kingdom of Gondor and of the Hosts of Ithilien flying high above. Dock hands and soldiers busy themselves on the pier, ready to receive the incoming ship, its speed now decreasing as it slips quietly in alongside. Sailors on board throw the thick rope lines to the men awaiting dockside, the ship jerking slightly as its forward motion ceases.  The captain announces he will wait only a short while before securing his ship again.

// north from Harad
atecho 54623 The city of Pelargir is visible to the west, a huge city built on the very edge of the river.  The ship tacks back and forth, working its way up the mighty river, the vastness of Southern Gondor passing to the west, rich land supporting many farms and villages.  To the east, the flat dry plains of southernmost Ithilien stretch to the eastern horizon, where a distant black line marks the Ephel Duath, the black mountains that border the land of Mordor.

A Crude Tree-House~
   The floor of this crudely crafted tree-house is a series of 
roughly cut logs, split down the middle to offer the semblance of 
an even surface. It is roughly square in shape, around six feet 
wide and long, each log held in place by multiple and redundant 
lashings. On each of the four sides a fully round log has been 
bound in place, providing a lip, around a foot tall, on each 
side. The platform has been positioned across a few of the 
thicker branches, along a flat portion of them, and bound tightly 
in place with the same rope holding the logs themselves together. 
This placement leaves the platform very slightly tilted.

A Wide Wooden Bridge~
   This long platform of lashed logs provides a rattling journey 
for carts and wagons, with rough walkways on either side. There 
are no walls or protection on the edges of the bridge from a 
quick fall into the roaring Anduin below. Just high enough to 
avoid the worst of the Anduin floods, the bridge reaches west to 
the mighty Cair Andros fortifications and east to the docks of a 
town.

The Front Room of a Sturdy Cabin~
   The interior of the cabin is simple in appearance, with a worn 
and almost decayed look to it. The floor appears to be the only 
non-mold-covered part of the room, and it is covered entirely 
with dirt ground hard into it by many passing feet. The 
yellow-brown color produced by the stone fireplace gives the 
decay a relatively cozy appearance. The north end of the cabin's 
front room has a door in the middle of its wall, which stops just 
as the arch of the roof starts with a thin wooden banister, 
revealing a loft to the north of it.

A Compact Room in the Log Cabin~
   This room is thin, but long, ranging the entire length of the 
cabin along the east-west axis, but two full-sized adults would 
find it difficult to stand shoulder to shoulder facing either 
east or west. Along the eastern wall, the side of a stone 
chimeny can be seen. The southern wall has peculiar little holes 
in it, and to the west of the door is a ladder leading up to a 
loft area. This room is fairly dark, and quite cold with a 
distinctly earthy smell to it. Along the southern wall, an iron 
bar can be seen, with matching braces on the door. It lies 
parallel to the braces, and appears to be able to slide.

   Wide, with a low ceiling, this loft hugs the top corners of 
the cabin. To the south, a solid banister stands before a clear 
and open view of the cabin's front room. The lighting here is 
muted, and the slightly soggy wood helps to dull sounds as well. 
About the ground are strewn a few bed-rolls, and to the north

A Long Entry Foyer~
   Wide enough to comfortably fit three abreast, this hallway 
sits in the center of the cabin, a stout wooden door and hefty 
walls sheltering it at either end from the outdoors. A pair of 
walls extend alongside the foyer, empty frames neatly sawed out 
to allow entrance to the adjoining rooms. The floor is formed of 
evenly spaced and finely-milled pine lumber. Rather dark, the 
only natural light is whatever escapes from the empty frames on 
either side of the hall.

The only exit is set in the southern wall, a neatly sawn-out door 
frame. The ceiling is high and angled upwards, towards the 
center of the cabin. Pine lumber has been set down, stained, and 
sanded for finer flooring.

Outside a Sturdy Wooden Cabin~
   All around this area, the forest of Ithilien looms. This 
small clearing is just large enough to fit a single small cabin, 
which has been built out of sturdy timber. The clearing itself 
is so small that trees still loom over the cabin, though out 
front, an unobstructed view to the sky exists. Not far to the 
west the village of Amdir can be seen, but other than that, the 
cabin is secluded and the forest mutes most sounds nearby.

ancient army, the trees extend east and west, looming over as if 
constantly threatening to push further south. Directly opposite 
the oaks and maples lies a desolate vista of crags, fissures and 
mishapen hills dominated by dark brown.

slightest pressure or wind. The only wildlife here are the small 
lizards and mice scuttling across the dusty stone surfaces. The 
cracked side of a peak lies directly across, getting taller and 
taller as one goes further down. Three pillar-like stones claw 
at the sky directly above, and it seems as if the slope evens out 
as one gets closer to them.

   The slate underneath becomes larger as it runs to the gorge 
below. A solid face of rock, pockmarked by small holes, 
constitutes the other side of the gorge. A high-pitched sound is

buffet the tops of these slabs, scouring them clean of any of the

A Small Common Area in the Cabin~
   Built from solid planks of birch, this small common area has 
been carefully built. The boards of the floor are tightly set 
and hammered, without gap or crack present. On the north west 
corner of the room, a small trap door just large enough for a man 
of average size to pass through has been placed. A small door of 
birchwood leads north, while a stout ladder of oak placed on the 
eastern side of the cabin leads up to the attic.

A Cozy Bedroom~
   With enough room for at least a bed, and accompanying 
furniture, this room is large enough for two occupants to fit in 
comfortably. A small window is set into the northern wall, 
allowing light to pass in during daylight hours. Sturdy birch 
logs have been stacked one on top of another to form walls, 
giving protection from the elements.

A Dank, Muddy Cellar~
   The cellar has been dug roughly six feet down, and is not 
particularly large. It is roughly five paces by four, and the 
walls are of packed dirt, held up by a few supporting logs. No 
effort has been made to seal off the dirt floor from water, and 
so several small puddles of mud can usually be found in this dank 
area.

A Small Crawl Space~
   This small room can barely be considered more than a crawl 
space. About five feet in height where the roof is at its peak, 
it slopes down to the floor in others. Large enough for storage 
mostly, the roof above has been sealed against the elements. The 
smell of birch and pine permeates the area near constantly.

The End of the Dark Hallway~
   The green rug draws to an end in this murky corner of the 
hallway. Where to the east, silence was the rule, here the din 
from the tavern below can be heard through the floor. Nothing 
clear makes it up, but there is a fairly constant level of noise. 
The walls and doors, however, remain soundproof, the ambient 
sounds coming only from the ground below. 
   Over the northern door is the numeral six, while over the 
southern door is the numeral seven and over the western door is 
the numeral eight.

A Narrow Hallway, with Dim Lighting~
   The green rug continues along the ground, its color muted by 
both the dark shadows and the the passing of many feet. The 
sparsely placed lamps provide a dreary lighting which adds to the 
sedate mood of the hallway. The thick walls and doors seem to 
absorb sound quickly, so voices do not carry very far in this 
hallway. Villagers who are not yet fully settled, as well as 
some soldiers pass through the hallway at all hours of the day. 
   Over the northern door is the numeral four, while over the 
southern door is the numeral five.

A Long, Murkily Lit Hallway Crowning a Staircase~
   A staircase emerges into this dim hallway, which continues on 
to the west. Each wall is disrupted by a door, with a numeral 
etched over it, and seemingly the fewest required lamps to allow 
one to see. Each of the lamps burns gently, the muted light 
yellow and dull. Deep shadows are cast on the wooden walls and 
doors, from about knee-height down. A dull green rug extends 
down the hallway, always remaining a foot away from the walls at 
its edges. Down the stairs, the door to the foyer can be heard 
opening and closing, and with it, gusts of outside air, that 
find themselves channeled up the stairs and into the hallway. 
   Over the eastern door, is the numeral one, while over the 
northern door is two and the southern door is three.

A Compact Room, with a South Facing Window~
   Spartan in design, this room may have been described by some 
as an over-sized closet. The thick log construction provides it 
quite a sturdy feel, as well as a degree of insulation. In the

similarly small lamp next to the northern door. A small degree 
of the din from the tavern below can be heard through the 
floorboards, but it is most often barely noticeable.

   This room is constructed of thick log wood, with sturdy labor 
put in to its construction. Clearly spartan in its design, there 
is only one room to the apartment, with a trio of small windows 
to the north, west and south. From the ground below, the muted 
din of the White Hart Tavern can be heard, with occasional bursts 
of laughter rising above the droning sound. Next to the door in 
the eastern wall is a small lamp which is intended, almost 
laughably, to bring light to the entire room.

A Small Garden Before a Cabin~
   A low wooden fence marks out a small area of land, within 
which a cabin has been raised of birch logs. Small windows are 
set on either side of the sturdy doorway here and on either side 
of the path to the cabin are small patches of earth. Southwards, 
the path leads through a gap in the fence onto Rath Fangird. The 
cabin seems to back on directly against the southern wall of the 
White Hart tavern.

cabin. This front room is spacious enough to easily accommodate 
many, though designed so that a cozy, comfortable atmosphere 
prevails. The logs appear freshly-cut, and the worksmanship is 
sturdy and reliable, though not overly ornate. A long curtain 
drapes across a western doorway and a small step ladder leads to 
a trap door in the southwest corner of the cabin. Against the 
northern wall two small windows lend a view of the path and Rath 
Fangird beyond, with a sturdy door set between them.

A Small Cosy Kitchen~
   With a little less polish than the rest of the cabin, the 
kitchen appears to be a busy place when occupied. Though small, 
all of its accessories are arranged neatly, providing an 
organized, if close, space to work in. A curtain can be used to 
block onlookers from the main room of the cabin. This is a 
spartan yet functional room.

The Upper Bedroom~
   A wide window is set against the eastern wall, offering a view 
of Anor's rise each morning. The light streams in on a clear 
day, seeming to life the scents of the birch and pine used to 
construct this spacious room. It stretches the entire length and 
width of the cabin, with eaves rising a little to a raised trunk 
of wood running down the middle of the roof. Lamps are 
positioned to cast pools of light against the night or a dark 
day, lending a gentle glow and peace to this quiet room.

A High-Arched Greatroom~
   The dominant feature of this well laid-out central room is its 
high arching ceiling, affording the perception of expansiveness 
to the relatively modest sized space. The walls have been planed 
smooth and finished with a light coat of varnish that accentuates 
the natural grain of the wood, giving them a warm golden hue. A 
heavy oaken door is set into the center of the western wall, its 
brass fittings gleaming and highly polished. Several shuttered 
windows allow light from the outside to wash over the smooth 
sanded floor, offering an air of warmth and coziness to the 
abode. The room's eastern wall is a broad archway which opens 
into a good sized kitchen while the south end of the chamber has 
been fashioned into a study and sitting area before a river rock 
fireplace. Set above the mantle, burned into the wood of the 
southern wall is a grand rendering of the White Tree, crowned by 
the seven stars of the House of Elendil. To the north, a wrought 
iron staircase spirals upward to a lofted bedchamber that 
overlooks this grand room.

A Cozy, Well Place Kitchen~
   This cozy cooking area is well configured, with a generous 
work space and a walk in pantry that maximizes the limited 
available footage. Though the room's dominant feature is the 
enormous cast iron stove, it retains the subdued splendor evident 
throughout the rest of the home. Hardwood walls planed to a fine 
finish, fit together and sealed in-between with beeswax help to 
retain the heat during the winter months while keeping the 
temperature moderate during the warmer part of the year. 
Differing from the rest of the cabin, the floor in this kitchen 
is composed of artfully laid out flagstone to absorb the heat 
generated by the stove. Through the archway to the east is the 
central room of the dwelling.

Bedroom~
   This modestly sized bedroom overlooks the central room of the 
home, a hardwood railing intricately carved with an intertwining 
pattern of ivy vines serving to separate the polished hardwood 
floor from the open space above the room below. A large window 
sits above the head of the bed, set flush into the northern wall. 
Though comfortably close, the room is spacious enough for a full 
suite of furniture without appearing crowded. Peering over the 
railing, one is treated to a view of the exquisite wood burning 
of the White Tree that graces the southern wall of the dwelling. 
Sacrificing a fireplace for extra room, the bedchamber is lofted, 
that the heat from the fireplace in the central room of the cabin 
offers sufficient warmth. A wrought iron stairwell descends into 
the cabin's main room.

Within a Log Cabin~
   Time worn timbers bear testament to the age and utility of 
this structure. The saw marks lining the window holes have long 
past been worried smooth though they continue to efficiently 
serve as a bar to the elements. The northwest corner of the room 
has been re-enforced with stone and serves as a heat shield for a 
stove. Opposite the heat shield is a series of stairs leading to 
the second floor. The ceiling is comfortably higher than the 
height of a man and the single room is spacious enough for a 
large family to have found residence here. The southern doorway 
provides overwatch on the immediate surrounding area.

Upstairs in a Log Cabin~
   Undivided and reflecting the dimensions of the floor 
downstairs this second story provides windows looking out each of 
the four walls. The windows stand empty of glass but are able to 
be closed against the outside world by way of shutters. Wattle 
and daub mortar fills the space between the logs that comprise 
the walls. The flooring timbers are worn smooth affect an 
efficient barrier to the light, noise and heat below. The 
windows overlook the approach and provide overwatch to the end of 
the path.

A Path Before A Cabin~
   A small path winds briefly through the underbrush leading 
deeper into the vicinity of a small abandoned cabin. Thickets 
and brambles bracket the path and obscure the vision as they 
encroach on the trail. Beyond the undergrowth the trees resume 
their vigil, reaching mutely toward the sky. The cabin is set 
back in a small clearing.

On Rope Bridge~
   An old rope bridge stretches out between the two platforms, 
spanning the river. It doesn't seem in very good condition, 
actually, with several pieces of it missing. Old, yellowed rope 
make up the rest of it, promising collapse at any moment. Water 
races below, a swift current ready to take away anyone that 
cannot maintain his footing upon the unsteady crossing. Stout 
pegs secure the construction on either side, still in fairly good 
repair compared to the rest of it.

A Burnt Out Old Home~
   Well mortared and heavy stones may be the reason this 
structure has survived where others are now mere memories slowly 
fading into the forest outside. The roof is long gone, exposing 
most of the ground floor to the environment. The floorboards 
comprising the bottom floor have been partially burned away 
revealing what once must have served as a root cellar or 
basement. This flooring provides limited shelter to the 
basement's occupants. Inset to the walls are windows at ground 
level that provide access to the surrounding area.

A arcing ancient cavern~
   This cavern stretches back from the eastern entrance to form

its undulating ceiling stands taller than the height of a man. 
The stone walls, floor and ceiling are solid, devoid of excess 
debris or broken rock. While predominantly grey, the walls here 
reflect mild traces of diverse minerals, their subdued color 
catching any light source and revealing a complex patina.

   The work of skilled hands are evidenced in the limited

strongly knotted ropes. Despite the continued resiliency of the 
cording the bridge is stained by the countless seasons it has 
withstood and the wooden stays are starting to give way to the 
elements.

A Small Low-Walled Stockade~
   This hastily constructed square area of cleared ground within 
the forest of Ithilien is barely large enough for thirty soldiers 
to stand within. Protection is offered from attack by a four 
wall low palisade that archers can fire over. Spiked logs stop 
easy access from outside. A stout strapped log gate sits in the 
southern wall. Anybody approaching would be able to loose arrows 
at those inside, but the logs grant good cover. From the 
northernmost stakes, archers can stare downwards at a descending 
northwards slope.

Atop One of the Stockade Archery Platforms~
   Offering unfettered view of the surrounding hillside leading 
down the valley and stream to the north, four archery towers are 
perched straddling each corner of the wooden palisades 
encompassing the stockade. Supported by five wooden posts as 
well as the wall itself, the platforms extend outwards away from 
the wall a few feet in order to allow those that patrol them the 
ability to fire at targets even as they reach the base of the 
palisades. The floor is rough and unfinished, the wood 
displaying numerous spliters, but it is sturdy and serves its 
purpose well, if without flair.

oak to prevent a collapse. The air within this chamber is cool, 
dry, and quite comfortable, and the sounds of the surface above

the forest of Ithilien is barely large enough for thirty soldiers 
to stand within. Protection is offered from attack by a four 
wall low palisade that archers can fire over. Spiked logs stop 
easy access from outside. A stout strapped log gate sits in the 
southern wall. Anybody approaching would be able to loose arrows 
at those inside, but the logs grant good cover. From the 
northernmost stakes, archers can stare downwards at a descending 
northwards slope.

The Eastern Storage Hollow~
   This room has been recently dug out of the ground, more 
closely resembling a small cave than anything else. Wooden slats 
have been lain across the roof to prevent ingress of loose dirt 
of the dripping of groundwater, supported by alternating posts of 
oak to prevent a collapse. The air within this chamber is cool, 
dry, and quite comfortable, and the sounds of the surface above 
are muted here. At the eastern end of the room, the overhang 
opens up to to sky, permitting ingress and a means to leave the 
hollow.

Upon the Stockade Towers~
   Offering unfettered view of the surrounding hillside leading 
down the valley and stream to the north, four archery towers are 
perched straddling each corner of the wooden palisades 
encompassing the stockade. Supported by five wooden posts as 
well as the wall itself, the platforms extend outwards away from 
the wall a few feet in order to allow those that patrol them the 
ability to fire at targets even as they reach the base of the 
palisades. The floor is rough and unfinished, the wood 
displaying numerous splinters, but it is sturdy and serves its 
purpose well, if without flair.

The Western Sleeping Hollow~
   This hollow has been dug out from the loamy soil of Ithilien, 
the cool air within smelling distinctly as pine needles and dirt. 
The room is not spacious by any means, but it is dry and out of 
the elements. Wooden boards have been placed across the arched 
ceiling, supported by stout wooden posts that alternate to hold 
them up. The sounds of snoring soldiers can oft be heard here.

An Ancient, Decrepit Cairn~
   Many hundreds of years old, this ancient tomb has long since 
given way to the slow grind of time. Runes long ago carved into 
the floor and walls have been worn away by water, fungus and the 
now dead roots of the burnt out pine trees above. The eastern 
wall has since partially caved in, leaving the once thick stone 
in a shattered mound on the floor and the very corner of what 
looks to be a crushed sarcophagi reaches out at the feet of the 
unwary. A thick black waterline hovers a few feet beneath the 
ceiling, hinting that at one time this tomb was under many feet 
of water. Various roots have clawed their way through the cracks 
in the ceiling, covering the northern wall in a thick curtain.

A Small Cave at the Bottom of a Rock Chute~
   This small natural cave is the size of a small cottage with a 
hole in the roof that leads up to open sky far, far above. 
Slightly off center, the chute ascends a hundred feet or more and 
allows the light of Anor and pale glow of Ithil at certain times 
of the day and night. It would seem that over the millennium 
rainfall from above has carved out this space, which slopes down 
towards a thin crack in the western wall where the water has 
since found an escape. The walls are somewhat smooth, worn by 
natural forces and show the stained remains of mold and fungi.

A Circle of Cairns Atop a Wide, Windswept Hill~
   A circle of battered and weathered stone monoliths surround a 
half-dozen small cairns in different states of disrepair atop 
this wide hilltop. Outside of the copse of corpse-like tree 
trunks in the very center of the circle, burnt and torn asunder 
by some terrible fury, there is no plant life sans a sickly 
looking lichen that clings heavily to the Cairns, and a flowering 
bush that seems particularly resilient. Any writing or signs of 
the civilization or people responsible for these great works have 
long since been erased by time. There are no signs or sounds of 
any wildlife, making the place eerily silent. The only obvious

clusters. Large, dark-green leathery leaves sueded with rusty 
fuzz on the underside decorate the spreading branches of the 
trees that dominate this stretch of forest during the summer

intertwining austere angles. Flying insects buzz about under

sentient, it is impossible to discern.
