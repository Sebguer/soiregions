a short-hafted workmans hammer~
A short-hafted workmans hammer marked with runes lies here.~
This small, businesslike hammer is made completely by a dull, grey metal. The haft is banded with slightly ridged metal strips. A few runes have been etched into the side of the head, their simple structures interlocking in a complicated larger pattern.
