walking corpse undead zombie drooling rotting~
a walking corpse~
~
Its form prior to being awakened by obscene and dark magics is 
barely discernable as this walking corpse prowls by in utter 
silence.  Loose flesh drips from the many bones which, long ago 
broken, tear out from its nausiating body.  The creature moves 
slowly and mechanically, lacking the grace and speed it once may 
have had.

a goofy-looking man~
A goofy-looking man stands here, drooling and gazing about vapidly.~
A rather vapid-looking fellow, this man's chin is drenched in 
drool and loose spittle.  His low brow barely reaches an inch 
above his eyes, and he keeps his hands clasped behind his back.

a tiny, light-green grasshopper~
A tiny, light-green grasshopper hops along.~
This light green little bug, often perching at the tip of a 
blade of tall grass, making soft chirping noises with its hind 
legs, can leap a good three feet from the ground.  Its body 
blends easily in grassy areas, save its brighter yellow tummy.

Norman the Newbie stands here, looking lost.~
Norman is a newbie of nervous disposition.  He knows you're 
going to send him into nasty places where he will likely die; and 
he disapproves of it intensely.  Not a lot he can do about it 
though.

a fuzzy, black spider~
A small, fuzzy black spider creeps around its glistening web.~
   Thin, furry legs stem out from the fat, almost perfectly 
spherical, fuzzy body of this arachnid.  Its movements seem 
quite paced, save the occasional leap toward prey, or scurried 
defense.  A single red stripe trails from between twelve beady, 
fiery eyes down its coal-black body.

an enormous, maple-feathered eagle~
An enormous eagle with maple-colored feathers perches nearby.~
   Cautiously peering about its surroundings with keen, 
pine-green eyes, this giant bird of prey stands tall and proud.  
Sleek, maple-brown feathers, glimmering in the right light, 
delicately cover its form from head to tail.  Ruffled, shorter 
feathers of a darker brown protect its sturdy legs to its claws - 
talons hard and sharp.  This eagle's movements are extremely 
quick and fluid, despite its immense size, as it soars rapidly 
and with much ease or simply perches serenely at a cliff or on a 
tree limb.

a broad-shouldered, blonde youth~
A young man of a broad build is here, blonde hair falling over his back.~
   Standing tall, this healthy lad poises himself somewhat 
sternly, though his expression is more of a solemn gentleness.  
Long, blonde hair falls over his broad shoulders, draping along 
his back and framing his ovular face - enhancing the tiny ashen 
and yellow specks within the deep green color of his eyes.  
Evidently in his late teens, he seems to have a strong build, 
though not seemingly muscular, and moves about with a certain 
rhythm, contentedly bobbing from side to side.

A lanky, dark-haired young man bustles about, dusted in flour.~
   Quite tall and thin, this young man happily bustles about, 
cheeks glowing with contentment as he carefully organizes and 
keeps watch over his baked goods. His long face, lightly dusted 
with flour falling from a short crop of dark hair, is illuminated 
by the wide smile he presents to his customers, eyebrows often 
lifted to better reveal magnificent blue eyes beneath the natural 
creases of his forehead. He struts about with a pleasant, 
confident air, the occasional robust laugh escaping his lips as 
he greets and jokes with patrons of the shop.

a gigantic, silver-furred wolf~
A gigantic, silver-furred wolf lies here by the fire, watching protectively.~
Soft silver fur covers the muscular body of this gigantic wolf, 
and ripples with each of his movements.  Pale, almost white eyes 
watch his surroundings warily, as his moist muzzle sniffs at the 
air.  Long white fangs poke out from behind his lips, showing 
hints of reddish blood stains about the gums.  His ears are in 
constant motions, each notched and scarred from possible fights.

A smallish, sienna-haired woman stands here, going about her daily chores.~
Child-like in appearance and stature, this young sienna-haired 
woman stands with confidence.  Her hair hangs long and tightly 
bound in a braid at the nape of her neck.  Shining, emerald eyes 
peer out from over a button nose and puffy cheeks.  Her little 
form is curved in all the right places, and she moves with a 
mouse-like grace about the room.

a tiny, brown-haired girl~
A tiny girl with brown hair sits here, playing.~
This adorable, tiny girl's brown hair has barely had time to 
grow.  It lays about her little head haphassardly, but its 
softless and shine can be seen from a distance away.  Her large 
brown eyes gaze about with couriosity, and her stubby fingers 
reach and grab for everything.  A small, button nose sits in 
between two chubby cheeks that dimple when she laughs and smiles.

frog shifting hues iridescent~
an iridescent frog~
A frog of many shifting hues squats here bearing the mark of Genesis.~
   This small frog bears an infinity of ever shifting colors
upon its gummy skin.  It sits on its haunches, utterly at
peace.  On its left flank glimmers the unmistakable sigil
of Genesis, the ever working.  It glows there with a final
amber radiance, its twist and turns impossible in their
intricacy.  This bulbous eyed bubble toed amphibian wears
it with a quiet pride.

Ulrik gruff black bearded dwarf short smith weapon~
a gruff, black-bearded dwarf~
A short-statured dwarf of gruff build carefully watches over his goods.~
   This husky fellow stands quite sternly, seeming to put on an 
air of more confidence than he is actually familiar with.  
Though his overbearing stance and proud attitude may compensate 
for the certain physical deficit he bears from his missing right 
eye, it may more commonly be perceived as paranoia or just plain 
grumpiness.  Scraggly, thick, black locks fall messily from his 
head, face and chin, reaching about mid-torso, while two braids 
from his long mustache frame his mouth and lower jaw - the dark 
contrasting the pale blue shade of his good eye.  His build is 
quite gruff and muscular, callused hands bearing the history of 
his hard work.

A man skulks about here, clad in ragged camoflage.~
   This man looks aged beyond his years from terrible strife.  
His blue eyes dart furtively about, set within a gaunt face.  
Patches of rough hair adorn his head, barely covering old burn 
marks.  Many ugly purple splotches and lumps cover his skin, 
wafting a horrid stench.  His frame seems quite malnourished.

A multi-colored songbird is perched upon the high branches, chirping merrily.~
This little songbird's feathers glitter of all the bright colors 
of the rainbow, as it flutters lightly among the high branches of 
the forest trees.  It sings merrily, bringing joy to the land, 
with a voice of unexpected sharpness for a creature of its size.

a short blunt nosed orc with a tuft of hair~
A short blunt nosed orc with a tuft of black hair stands here leering.~
   Standing well above the rooftops of most buildings, this huge, 
corpse of a man gives off a fearful aura. His head is patched 
with small tufts of ancient hair and exposed wounds. They travel 
down to about his face, where two, eyeless sockets seem to be lit 
with a burning fire from within. His nose is gone, possibly it 
has been rotted away, or maybe just removed. Underneath that, 
his colorless lips curl across blackened teeth in a evil, soft 
grin. All of his facial features are raised with his head on top 
of an exposed spinal neck. Where his skin can be seen, it wreeks 
of decay and flies. Some small patches of flesh droop down from 
open cuts, where blackened bone, and charred muscle can be 
spotted.

orc fierce dark green broad nosed muscular Trashkar~
a fierce, dark green skinned orc~
A fierce, dark green skinned orc with a broad nose and heavy muscles is here.~
This young woman stands a bit over five feet tall and her build is trim with lean, lightly corded muscles along her limbs. A thick crop of ebon-black hair flows down over her head in gentle waves and soft ringlets that end several inches past her slender shoulders. The woman's skin is a soft tanned color, leaning on the fairer side of medium-olive in hue, hinting at a young life in the sun. Pale, pinkish scars of various shapes and sizes mar the otherwise clear complexion of her body, one of the more noticeable scars being set against her left cheek. The scar on her cheek consists of light pink flesh that has been puckered and wrinkled from intense heat. It angles from her jaw line all the way up to her cheekbone in a straight line. Set against her left hand is the beginning of a dark green tattoo, shaped into that of the head of a snake with tongue in mid-flick. Should her arm be exposed, the rest of the tattoo can be seen spiraling up her flesh until ending at the bend of her arm. A pair of brilliant-green eyes stare out under lightly arched, thin-lined brows, the color itself is like a pale emerald with altering shades of darker and lighter greens. Her lips are full and a shade darker than the rest of her skin, hinted with a rosy hue. When pulled back into a smile, they reveal a straight row of ivory-white teeth as well as her small, fang-like eyeteeth. Her body, though lithe overall, still bears the sumptuous curves of a matured woman, from her ample bosom, slender waist and thick-set hips, to her long, shapely legs, giving her a well formed hour-glass figure.

A jet-black fox with a silver-tipped tail is here.~
   Majestic in appearance, this fox has a beautiful lustrous 
jet-black coat and an eye-catching tail that ends in a silver 
tip. Its pointy muzzle has a tiny black nose that is always 
located low to the ground so as to sniff out any potential prey. 
The fox is very quick and nimble, and seems to have some sort of 
ability to sense anyone coming too close, making it very hard to 
catch.

Its pointy muzzle has a tiny black nose that is always located

layers of fat around its belly, and by the lack of fear that it 
displays towards people and domesticated animals alike.

a bearded, soft-blue-eyed man~
A bearded man with soft, blue eyes is sitting at one of the smaller tables.~
Dark brown hair, short as though nature itself keeps it in place,
is layered on this man's head.  A shade of soft blue eyes are entracing
and look peaceful, and his sturdy yet wiry build seems relaxed. His hands
are well-kept, most likely from regular grooming and his complexion is a
slight bronze, as though he has seen at least some of the sun, and upon 
his face a full beard has grown, showing his years.

Jeannie beautiful blonde warm smile~
a beautiful blonde with a warm smile~
A beautiful blonde with a warm smile is standing here.~
   A warm look is almost always present on the face of this young 
beautiful woman. Her sun-blonde hair, interlocking into a 
complicated pattern, sways in the slightest breeze. The two 
sapphire-blue eyes glitter whenever the narrow dimpled cheeks 
push up into a warm and pleasant smile. Her skin is smooth and 
pale, reflecting with a soft glow under candlelight.

stanzi kitten calico cat~
a calico kitten~
A calico kitten bumbles here.~
   It is a small, female calico kitten, with patches of brown,
white, and grey all over her body, interspersed with dark grey
stripes. Her eyes are golden yellow and very wide, and her ears
are quite large for her small size. When she meows, which seems
like constantly, her voice is loud and very raspy. Clumsy and
uncoordinated, she bumbles rather than walks.

familiar dragon turquoise tiny~
a tiny, turquoise dragon familiar~
Flapping about here is a minute familiar in the shape of a dragon.~
This familiar's form is tiny compared to its larger relatives,
being roughly the size of a cat. Its body is covered in a 
multitude of turquoise scales, each one minute and giving a 
supple feel to it. With a long snout and two pronounced nostrils, 
the dragon familiar moves about with grace and speed, two 
leathery wings providing it lift from the ground. Its eyes are 
orbs of flowing mercury, the light catching and reflecting in 
them.

Albero gruff barrel chested man~
a gruff, barrel-chested man~
A gruff looking man with a barrel-chest stands here.~
   While definitely not being the tallest of people, this man 
more than makes up for it in sheer bulk and brawn, with a wide 
and broad chest slightly out of place of his squat stature. 
Thick, muscular arms end at large, strong hands, marked and 
scarred by many years of some form of hard labour. His skin is 
well tanned and weathered, the occasional nick and freckle 
present upon it. This man's blue-grey eyes look out from a broad 
brow, staring past a slightly bulbous, crooked nose. Throughout 
his movements and actions, this man carries himself with a most 
confident manner, moving his well-built body with a certain 
forcefulness.

an enormous blue djinn~
A #4dark blue#5 djinn stands here, a firm look on his face.#0~
This blue djinn's head is covered by a mane of thick blonde 
hair that trickles down to connect to a small bristly yellowish 
moustache. The rest of his head is dominated by the squashed 
nose and large fatty cheeks that give the head the appearance of 
a near-perfect sphere. Two large greenish eyes glisten out in 
contrast to the light-colored facial hair. The djinn is tall and 
dominating, staring down onto everyone with a look of proud 
disdain.

a towering, dark-skinned man~
A towering, dark-skinned man is here, gazing fiercely about.~
   Towering above most of his surroundings, this grim-looking man 
moves in silence, his thick lips twisted into a fierce scowl. 
His eyes, dark and smouldering coals, survey the area, glittering 
with an acute alertness. Jagged, nightmarish designs have been 
placed on his face, the brilliant white hue of the war paint 
contrasting sharply with his pitch-coloured skin. His arms and 
legs are powerfully muscled, and his massive frame seems to 
nearly pulse with a taut, ferocious energy.

A pensive, raven-haired man lingers here in contemplation.~
   Long, shimmering locks of fine raven-black hair tumble down 
about this man's shoulders. He is fairly tall, and stands erect, 
his posture one of presence and poise. His skin is quite fair, 
contrasting sharply to the darkness of his hair; his eyes are a 
bright, glittering grey, nearly silver in hue. His face, a regal 
collection of sharp angles and distinct planes, bears an 
expression softened in studious contemplation. His movements are 
graceful, precise, and fluid.

A diminutive, honey-haired Hobbit lass is here, gazing curiously about.~
   Luxuriant curls of bright golden hair tumble down about
this young Hobbit lass's small frame. Her face seems nearly
alight with exuberance at any given moment, her full lips
curved into a delighted smile at some happy turn of fate.
Sparkling blue eyes gaze out at the world, more than a rare
glint of mischief hinted at in their depths. Her frame is
quite small, even by the standards of her people, and her
movements are possessed of equal grace and fluidity.

A jovial-looking, sable-maned male Hobbit is here, smoking a pipe.~
   Of a rather impressive girth for one of his people, this
distinctly jovial-looking male Hobbit appears to have had
more than his share of life's little pleasures. His face,
tinged a cheerfully florid red, is often lit with a broad,
dimpled smile. Thick, curly sable hair adorns his head in
a healthy, unruly mop, and eyes of a matching color regard
the world with an acute if slightly amused sparkle. His feet,
shoeless, are covered with a thick mane of matching color.

A shadowy, flame-shrouded apparition is here, blazing with unholy fury.~
   A study in paradox, this creature seems to be a construction
of pure shadow alight with hellishly blazing flame. Easily as
tall as a small building, the sheer strength and power that
it exudes is overwhelmingly terrifying. Two massive, bat-like
sheets of flame arise from what seems to be its back, possibly
serving as wings. Its frame is squat despite its massive height,
hinting at solid endurance and stability.

A grey-haired, sapphirine-eyed old man stands here, gazing placidly about.~
   Sparkling eyes of a brilliantly vibrant blue tint gaze out
at the world, set beneath bushy, formidable-looking grey brows.
This old man's face has been weathered and wizened from the
passage of countless years, and the care lines clustered about
the corners of his eyes lend him a kind, benevolent look. A
long, unruly grey beard trails downward from his chin to nearly
the middle of his chest, and an equally wind-tangled mane of
silvery-grey falls down about his shoulders. His frame is
compact, and his posture is erect, unbowed by his burdens.

a colossal, crimson-scaled, emerald-eyed wyrm~
A colossal, crimson-scaled wyrm rests here, wings folded and tail curled.~
   The size of this massive reptilian creature is absolutely
staggering. Easily the size of most buildings, its bulk is
quite intimidating even when it is at rest, its huge wings
furled and its head on the floor. A row of wickedly sharp
spines trails down its neck all the way to its tail, and
razor-sharp fangs the size of greatswords can be glimpsed
in its mouth. Eyes of a startlingly vibrant green, with
black slitted pupils, gaze hypnotically outward; the sharp
contrast they form against the brilliant fiery crimson of
its gleaming scales is nearly as entrancing.

a mighty oak tree~
A mighty oak tree is rooted here, watching the years pass in silence.~
   Approximately fourteen feet high, the branches of this
mighty oak extend upward and outward a great deal beyond
the time-worn trunk. Possessed of healthy leaves and a
thick, hale-looking sheath of bark, this tree appears to
be in its prime. Startlingly, however, upon a closer
examination one can note an eerily human visage on one
side of the trunk; a nose is visible, as is a mouth, and
two black, glittering eyes.

a bloated, piebald troll~
A gigantic troll looms here, its skin mottled.~
   Looming at the size of twice the tallest human, this troll is 
a monster in the true sense of the word. Its face is that of a 
large chunk of hewn stone, both in colour and shape, the gaping 
mouth in the centre filled with disgusting black teeth. Its nose 
is squashed into the centre of its face, with little more then 
empty round holes for nostrils. Several broken scars criss-cross 
the face, across its beady eyes and the crown of its bald head. 
A huge, bloated stomach wobbles with every movement, sitting as 
it does atop thick, tree like legs. Fat more than muscle covers 
its massive arms, yet it is clear they could easily rip a human 
or orc in two with its chalky, broken-nail fingers. Its colour 
is inconsistent, mountain grey on its head and part-way down the 
scarred back, and black along the left arm until it meets the 
grey, with chalky white covering the rest of the creatures body, 
barring the right leg where all three colours sit together.

It has a set of sharp, pointy, little teeth which are always 
bared in a fierce sneer. It has unusually light, sea-green skin, 
with a slight mottling of brown occasionally apparent. Its 
pupils are milky white in coloration and it has a shock of long 
scraggly black hair extending from its head. Its thin ears are 
long and unmarred extending some distance from its head. Its 
lips are black and cold, making it unusually tough looking for a 
goblin.

warg NOT TO BE USED IC~
a massive black warg with a scarred eye~
A great black warg is here, snarling at anything nearby.~
   This warg is quite large even for a warg. He probably comes 
face to face with a tall man height-wise. One of his eyes has a 
long straight pink scar, around which no black fur grows. The 
scar passes directly over his eye, probably from a heavy sword or 
an axe. It bares white, sharp canines coming down on the sides 
of a menacing row of sharp teeth. Alert ears press against the 
back of his head, when anyone comes close to him except his 
rider. This is the only feature of Orcish domestication the 
beast shows. A glint of primal hatred shows in his eyes, where 
some of the wargs appear more intelligent and less rabid, this 
one appears more wolf-like and furious as if it had been wronged 
by the world somehow.

a grizzled, sturdily-built dwarf~
A grizzled, sturdily-built dwarf is here, gazing irritably about.~
   A rugged, scarred face as unflinching and unyielding as the 
stone his people are renowned for working stares impassively out 
at the world. Lips hidden within the bristling mass of his 
chest-length black beard curve more often into a grimace of 
irritation or disgust than into a smile, and his eyes remain 
nigh-perpetually narrowed, as if scrutinizing everything and 
everyone about him. He moves with the somewhat irregular gait of 
his short-legged people, and his hands are scarred and calloused, 
having seen much battle.

a graceful, flaxen-haired Elvish maiden~
A graceful, flaxen-haired Elvish maiden lingers here, gazing quietly about.~
   Long, shimmering strands of fine golden hair tumble down
about the graceful, delicate shoulders of this youthful-looking
Elvish maiden. Thin, soft lips seem to continually quirk upward
into a quiet smile, and gleaming silver eyes peer out at the
world with a distinctly playful glint of wisdom. Her frame is
lithe and willowy, and her movements are graceful and fluid
nigh to the point of appearing ethereal.

Erlil ivory-complected aquiline man~
an ivory-complected, aquiline man~
An ivory-complected, aquiline man stands here.~
   This man's defined bone structure suggests a regal quality;
an aquiline nose, angled chin, prominently raised cheekbones and
a proud forehead evoke the image of a great king, but the rest of
his appearance characterizes him as merely a mortal man: a poorly
grown-in stubble of a beard, dirt smudges upon his pale skin and
yellowing teeth. Eyes of a dark, almost tainted blue complete this
study in contradiction.

a gruff, roughly-shaven man~
A gruff, roughly-shaven man is here, carefully looking around.~
   A pair of dull, blue eyes glances out from the rugged, 
unshaven face of this short man. His dirty-blonde hair is in 
disarray, and resembles something trimmed by a goat. An attempt 
at a ponytail is unskillfully bound in the back of his head, 
trailing over his left shoulder. The man has a small belly, but 
he is somewhat muscular; he always stands straight, holding his 
shoulders out in a proud manner, as he looks about with a gruff 
and disdainful look.

pincers as it walks.

A tiny girl runs about here, charcoal hair reaching her waist.~
   A pretty little thing, this young child who probably has yet 
to see half a decade, is bright and energetic, and busies herself 
with running about like a mad thing. Her brown eyes are barely 
visible from beneath her thick, if knotted, charcoal-black hair 
which runs to her waist. Her skin is very pale, as if she spends 
a lot of time indoors.

   With a thick, leathery hide and beady yellow eyes this fiend 
looks to be some formarian ape gone wrong. Long, heavy arms move 
upon knuckles which drag across the ground when this creature 
moves. The beasts mouth comes out forward to display a menacing 
row of sharp teeth which have been smacked upon this creatures 
face in a dagger-like fashion. The legs are short and bent, 
allowing it to use both its arms and its legs to propel itself 
forward, or to lurch violently in a single movement.

A runty, red-haired young lad stands here.~
This scraggly, red-haired boy is thin and pale, his face acned 
and pockmarked. An untidy mess of brown hair crowns his 
forehead, oddly accentuated by the strange mahogany of his deep 
set eyes. A thin, flat nose set above a pair of equally thin, 
pale red lips completes his visage. His runty, thin-libmed frame 
is lanky and generally un-muscled. It seems a miracle that he 
manages to stay upright and standing.

A brown-bearded, obsidian-eyed dwarf stands here.~
A mess of curly, brown hair frames the face of this compact dwarf, 
stretching down from his rounded head in a wiry swirl to form a 
clean-cut, bushy beard with a hint of rusty red. His eyes are deep set 
and shine with a stark, opal black, drawing attention towards the 
center of his bulbous, reddened face. A short, stubby nose sits above 
a thin-lipped mouth, completing his stout visage. His build is rather 
heavy with well-muscled arms and body set atop a pair of short, but 
powerful legs.

   Standing about one and a half feet tall, this full-grown male 
turkey is quite fat. He is covered in dark brown feathers, 
except for the tips of his tail feathers, which are white. A 
bright red wattle and caruncles hangs from his neck beneath the 
beak, jiggling about as he struts around with his round chest 
puffed out.

a pulchritudinous pet project~
A pulchritudinous pet project bounces around the area, defying gravity.~
   It's difficult to discern what this thing actually looks like, 
as it flickers and bounces around the room at the speed of a 
pixie on crack. It might have wings; it might just have wierd 
appendages on its back - or maybe that's its front. It's simply 
too hard to tell. Occasionally, it stops just long enough to 
whimper in your ear: "FEED ME!"

a lithe, fuzzy black cat~
A lithe, fuzzy black cat with golden eyes slinks about, ears perked.~
   This adult cat is long and lean, with large paws. Its soft, 
fuzzy fur is a deep, flawless black, making his large golden eyes 
stand out like eerie, twin suns. His large, almost bat-like ears 
constantly twitch about at any sound, even when he's asleep.

Jalil swarthy brutish war-painted man~
a swarthy, war-painted man~
A swarthy man stands here, his brutish features fiercely painted.~
   Twisted, ratty ebon dreadlocks fall to this swarthy man's 
broad shoulders, tied off with ragged strips of red cloth. A 
broad forehead, flat nose, and thick, full lips give this man a 
certain brutish air, at odds with the sharply intelligent glitter 
to his slanted, dark brown eyes. Intricate whorls of blood-red 
warpaint wind their way over his cheeks and up his temples, 
accented in places with bright yellow streaks. His sinewy frame 
is obviously no stranger to punishment, a web-work of scars 
wrapping their way over every visible inch of his coarse skin.

a bald man with light blonde eyebrows~
A bald man with barely-distinguishable blonde eyebrows stands here.~
   At first glance this man appears to have no eyebrows. Closer 
examination reveals barely-discernable, light-blonde eyebrows 
above his light blue eyes. His eyebrows are the only hair on his 
head above his nose, his head being completely bald while his 
chin and mouth, however, are hidden beneath a bushy beard and 
moustache. His arms and body appear quite muscular and his skin 
shows numerous scars. His large hands show signs of scars as 
well and each is missing a finger, his right index finger is 
missing at the knuckle while his left hand is missing the entire 
little finger.

Atruck brown-haired broken nose disfigured~
a brown-haired man with a broken nose~
A brown-haired man is here, his nose horribly disfigured.~
   The most striking feature of this mans face is his horribly 
disfigured nose. It is gnarled, having obviously been severely 
broken numerous times and healing incorrectly. One nostril is 
virtually closed off while the other is misshapen and opens 
toward the side of the nose. The rest of his face appears 
normal, his brown eyes gazing just below the bangs of his brown 
hair. When he opens his mouth, however, it can be seen he is 
missing many teeth. His hands are slightly scarred but show no 
other signs of damage.

A short man with dirty, unkempt hair stands here.~
   This man's brown hair sticks out from his head in every 
direction. Greasy and dirty, it shows no sign of care or 
attention whatsoever. Upon closer inspection, his left ear can 
be seen to be missing, only a small piece of flesh remaining in 
its place. His big brown eyes are constantly darting about, 
taking in his surroundings. His skin is darkly tanned, his hands 
are slightly calloused, and his fingernails are dirty.

Sparky warg sleek razor fanged~
a sleek, razor-fanged warg~
A razor-fanged warg with sleek, silvery fur stalks about menacingly.~
   Absolutely massive for one of its kind, this powerfully-built 
warg moves with unnerving grace and precision. Possessed of 
jagged, lethally sharp fangs, and a thick, healthy mane of fur, 
there is little doubt that this animal is currently in its prime. 
Its muscle is well-toned and amply distributed, and it appears to 
be, in all, quite a menacing figure.

a glossy-feathered, razor-beaked Emperor Penguin~
An Emperor Penguin with a razor beak and glossy feathers looms here ominously.~
From behind a long, hook-shaped beak, this penguin's cold gaze
drifts outward. Those unlucky enough to have it fall upon them
needn't worry much about their woes and troubles, as they're all
going to be summated shortly. A coat of glossy black-and-white
feathers adorns its body, as well as tinges of yellow in places.
A pair of large, floppy feet shuffle about, giving the penguin
a waddling gait. 

The horror.

A lean old man, his auburn hair scraggly and long, stands here.~
This aging man's face is wrinkled and weathered, pock-marks and
scars adorning the cheeks and forehead in several places. His
eyes are a murky, muddy brown, and bags are prevalent beneath
them. His lips are a little large, and his hair has begun to
gray in places, especially around the temples. A little short,
he's quite thin for his size, and is almost skin and bones in
places.

Farhad tobacconist slender fair haired man~
a slender, fair-haired man~
A slender, fair-haired man stands here.~
   This man is of a slender, lightly-muscled build, his 
sun-burned skin accented by the pale blue of his eyes, and the 
fair, light blonde of the head of well-cut hair atop his head. 
His lips are a deep red, set beneath a thin nose, between the 
sculpted, smooth features of his visage. His frame is straight 
and tall, and his movements are measured and sure.

Morgan Greyes roughly-shaven stormy-eyed man Hood~
a roughly-shaven, stormy-eyed man~
A roughly-shaven, stormy-eyed man stands here.~
   This man is tall in height and slender of build, his lightly 
muscled body supported by a pair of thin, but agile legs. His 
chin is dotted with a layer of rough black stubble, the pale red 
of his lips contrasting with the stark pitch of his sparse beard. 
His eyes are a stormy grey, set beneath a pair of serpentine, 
black brows, and above a thin, hawkish nose. His movements are 
measured, his gaze quick, and calculating.

a yellow-toothed, red-haired man~
A red-haired man stands here, his yellow teeth showing through his parted lips.~
   This man's visage is rather repulsive, complete with deep set, 
muddy brown eyes, and a pair of dry, red lips that part to reveal 
a nearly full set of yellow teeth. His hair is a bright red, 
shaggy, and spilling lightly over his shoulders and across his 
chest. His frame is lanky and light, but seemingly nimble.

a dark-eyed, auburn-haired man~
A dark-eyed man with rich, auburn hair stands here.~
   This man has a rather rough, dirtied appearance, his rich, 
braided auburn hair falling loosely to his shoulders, framing the 
extent of his scuffed, but chiseled features. His nose is bent 
and hawkish, his eyes a stark black, contrasting the pale white 
of his complexion. He is not overly-muscled, but looks to have a 
fairly strong build all the same.

a gaunt, pale-faced man with a crooked nose~
A gaunt, pale-faced man stands here, his nose crooked and misshapen.~
   This man has light blonde hair that spills down to his 
shoulders in an unruly, unkempt mane. His neck is slender, but 
muscular, supporting a gaunt, pale white visage, complete with 
two sky-blue eyes, a pair of thin red lips, and a crooked, 
misshapen nose. His frame is somewhat bent, his build lean, but 
lightly muscular. His fingers are knotted and dirty.

Wolf red-eyed~
a snarling red-eyed wolf~
A snarling red-eyed wolf paces here intently.~
   Massive powerfully built shoulders ripple the fur of this 
sleek dark wolf. Oversized claws that appear to be excessively 
sharp jut out from huge paws the size of a man's head. Most 
dominating however are the eyes on this wolf, which glower with a 
cruel intensity, thier color cast in a bright blood-red crimson. 
Under the thick snout spear out jagged long white teeth in a 
malicious manner, designed with the sole purpose of renting and 
tearing at flesh.

A transparant, white-eyed girl wavers in the air here.~
Not much can be seen about the shape of this young girl other then her basic figure and size. Her entire body is transparent like little more then a wisp of form in the air. Completely devoid and empty of any shape at all is her face, where it should be a hole contains nothing but darkness. Small arms and legs adorn her otherwise normal figure.

Beast razor-clawed toothy~
a toothy, razor-clawed beast~
A toothy, razor-clawed beast moves along with teeth bared.~
   An abomination in its own right, this massive shouldered beast 
has the markings of some wolf-dog mix corrupted into a horror. 
Twice as wide as a regular wolf and on four thick legs ending 
head sized paws, it reaches the average man's chest at the 
shoulder. Jutting out from its paws are long claws with an 
abnormal sharpness to them. Most grotesque are the beast's 
teeth, row after row of jagged slashing mandibles layering its 
gums all the way back into its throat.

a hunched, wispy man~
A hunched, wispy man is here.~
   Not much scarring at all can be found on the smooth cheeked 
face of this thin structured man. His entire body seems to have 
the overall template of narrow, thin and wispy. Arms and legs 
tapering gently along their thin lithe contours end with smaller 
hands and feet then the average human. His sleek black hair 
contrasts with the forest green that brightens his eyes with a 
lively sparkle.

Dolund squinty scribe man~
a squinty-eyed man~
A squinty-eyed man hunches a bit here.~
   Wrinkles crease the sides of this man's eyes which seem to be 
permanently in a squint. Despite this their soft amber color 
shows up well, accompanied by a honey browned skin tone. 
Blondish hair with odd wisps of brown covers his head and unkempt 
Tendrils have long since shagged down to his neck. A meager 
build on his body, it would appear he is less accustomed to 
physical labor then the average man. Black markings are easy to 
see on his hands, looking like blotchy black ink.

a large, black, dog-like creature~
A large, black, dog-like creature is here, its eyes glowing with flames.~
   This coal-black creature appears to be a large dog, but one quite 
unlike any ever seen before. The beast is huge, about the size 
of a large calf. Its large eyes glow like burning embers and 
flames burst from its gaping jaws, themselves dripping with 
flickering, blue, ethereal flame.

Terror slime tentacled~
a slime-tentacled terror~
A slime-tentacled terror writhes about in the sludge.~
   A mass of soggy festering flesh is alive and moving, locked the 
morbid embrace of thick slime. Gelatinous tentacles thicker than 
a troll's waist at the base connect to a body of creamy brown 
jelly. No eyes are apparent at all on the creature, and in fact 
the tentacles seem to be the only part of this beast with any 
structure to it at all. Some of the jelly is clear enough to 
make out the shape of objects digesting slowly inside, from deer 
and rats, to worms and the occasional human or goblin.

A curvaceous, curly-haired woman stands here.~
   This blonde woman is in mid-adulthood. Of average height and 
weight, she has a very curvaceous build, with generous hips and 
breasts and a narrow waist. Her waist-length curly hair is 
medium-blonde and quite wild, with three narrow braids falling 
from her left temple. Her bangs fall into her large, expressive 
gray eyes, which often twinkle with mischief above lips that seem 
expressly made for curving into sly smiles. She has small, 
capable-looking hands with well-tended fingernails.

a sturdy, horse-drawn supply wagon~
A sturdy, wooden supply wagon is here, two powerful horses hitched to it.~
   This large wagon is well-constructed from sturdy wooden 
planks. The corners are iron-banded for strength as are the four 
large wooden wheels. The back gate swings open to allow easier 
access in and out of the wagon. Good-sized, the wagon appears 
capable of holding a fair amount of cargo and of traveling 
modestly rough terrain. Hitched to the wagon are two 
powerful-looking horses, their coats slightly dirty but 
nevertheless well-groomed.

   This appears to be a large dog, of a size greater than is 
typical for such. Its coat is a shade of coal-black in color as 
are its eyes. Aside from its size, the only other unusual 
characteristic of this dog is its eyes. Pitch-black in color, 
its eyes are huge, much larger than normal for any dog.

a single occupant or two. Obviously designed to carry cargo 
rather than people or livestock, the cart has two wooden wheels, 
each made from the same old and weathered wood as the rest of the 
vehicle. Hitched to the cart is a grey donkey, its coat a bit 
dirty and in need of grooming.

   This wooden cart is large enough to comfortably fit three or 
four people inside, though any more and it would be quite 
cramped. Made from wood, the cart appears sturdy enough in 
construction, though the wood does creak when significant weight 
is placed in it. The cart has two large wheels, one on each 
side, made from wood which look very well-made, newer in fact 
than the cart itself. Hitched to the cart is a mule, its grey 
coat a bit dirty.

a sturdy chestnut draft-horse~
A sturdy, chestnut draft-horse is here.~
   This draft-horse reaches to near seventeen hands in height, 
it's coat a mild chestnut and possessing a thick black mane. Far 
stockier than any riding-horse, this stallion has clearly been 
raised on a life of labor and farm-work, it's barrel-chest deep 
and well muscled, thick shoulders clearly defined beneath an 
almost shaggy coat. It's head is large and straight in profile, 
with a long and arching neck. The hindquarters are heavy and 
rounded, similar in build to it's shoulders in being clearly 
suited for pulling heavy loads. Long, strong legs lead down to 
great wide hooves suited for gaining purchase in any terrain, a 
mottling of white coloring the legs to just bellow the shoulder 
and flank.

a sleek, black stallion~
A sleek, black-coated stallion is here.~
   Average in size for a stallion, the coat of this one is a dark 
black in color and has a healthy sheen to it. The horse's 
wildly-flowing mane is likewise black and its body is lean yet 
muscular. Standing here on its four powerful legs, this creature 
is the image of speed and grace.

#2An orc-like, wooden target stands here.#0~
   This tall, wooden target bears a close resemblance to an orc - 
its skin painted a muddy green, and its face accented by a pair 
of well-carved, pinewood tusks. Its arms and legs radiate 
outward from its torso, giving it the appearance of a flailing, 
cornered creature. Several holes and thin cuts mark its body, 
clearly the work of sharp arrows and other projectiles.

a short, brown-haired man with a moustache~
A short, brown-haired man with a moustache sits here, taking wagers.~
   This man has short, brown hair which is neatly cut but appears 
slightly out of place around his right ear, where he can 
frequently be seen sticking a quill when not using it. Overall, 
he is short of stature but not very stocky in build. His 
dark-blue eyes look out attentively and his thin lips seem 
eternally etched in a solemn expression. His hands are somewhat 
small for a man and numerous ink stains can be seen upon them.

A distinguished-looking man with grey hair stands here.~
   Grey hair, a bit thin but still full for a man of his age, 
tops the head of this distinguished-looking man. His frame is 
somewhat reduced by age, yet still shows signs of strength. His 
eyes are a dark blue and appear quite alert. His movements seem 
slow but carry deliberation.

a rigid, clean-cut, brown-haired man~
A clean-cut man with brown hair stands here rigidly.~
   This man has an extremely austere manner about him and 
although he does not look to be threatening one might be wise to 
take him as seriously as he seems to take himself. There is not 
a line in his face which might be called soft. His hair is tidy, 
combed and parted slightly toward the left and his lips are 
slight and drawn in a prominent lack of expression.

a handsome, commanding man~
A handsome man with a commanding presence stands here proudly.~
   This man positively brims with charisma and possesses a 
perfect mix of dashing good looks and heroic facial features. 
His hair is perfectly groomed and parted on the left, leaving 
much of his forehead above his strong brows available to better 
articulate any emotion he may be experiencing at any given 
moment. His eyebrows are a window into his feelings and perhaps 
even his deepest thoughts and they crown a set of deep, 
thoughtful brown eyes. His nose is bulbous, but not overly so, 
and it continues to follow the overall handsome form of this 
man's face. The strong lines and features of his face culminate 
at a strong and almost regal chin which offers a perfect platform 
upon which the rest of his features are formed.

A short, stern-faced man is here, directing workers.~
   Slightly balding, what is left of this man's hair is grey. 
Despite his age, his dark brown eyes appear quite alert. He is 
short of stature, partly due to his age though it is doubtful he 
was ever a tall man. His movements, slowed with age, are 
nevertheless deliberate.

a black-eyed, light-grey mule pulling a wooden cart~
A black-eyed, light-grey mule stands here, hitched to a covered wooden cart.~
   This slender-legged mule has a brushed, light-grey coat and a 
thin tail. Its torso is thin and well-muscled, and its curved 
hooves are thick. Its muzzle is wide, and crowned with two 
coal-black eyes. Its long ears stick outward rather awkwardly, 
and twitch periodically. A small wooden cart is attatched to its 
back, latched onto it by way of a series of leather straps and 
bronze buckles. The cart is covered in a dome of sewn burlap, 
supported by a skeleton of bent wooden poles.

a gaunt elf with flowing black hair~
A tall, gaunt male elf with flowing black hair stands here.~
   Extremely tall and thin, this male elf holds himself perfectly 
rigid. His facial features are almost childlike, smooth and 
subtle, yet his eyes are those of an elder adult; black pupils 
casting a piercing gaze. Long black hair flows down above his 
waist, kept straight and perfectly clean. His frame is thin and 
elongated; his legs, arms, and fingers all long and slender.

A striking female elf with long blonde hair stands here.~
   Long blonde hair cascades down this female elf's frame. Her 
face is gentle looking, with smooth features and a small nose. 
Her eyes are quite large for her head, the iris a sparkling blue 
color. She looks fragile, thin wispy arms leading to delicate 
fingers, her body quite feminine. Her posture is perfectly 
rigid, and she holds herself in a confident manner.

eagle IMMORTAL guardian majestic tawny feathered~
a majestic, tawny-feathered eagle~
A majestic, tawny-feathered eagle hovers here to the west.~
   Of an immense size, this eagle is sleek and well-proportioned. 
Its glossy feather are tawny in colour and run along its entire 
body, from the long stiff pin feathers of its wings to the fluffy 
down near its feet. Holding itself upright regally, its wings 
span six feet when fully unfurled, the creature itself a good 
three of four feet tall. Small, dark, beady eyes peer out from 
its somewhat small head, a curved, vicious-looking black beak 
warning off anyone unfriendly from the area.

a diminutive, ebon-haired woman~
A diminutive woman with tousled black hair lingers here.~
   This young woman's tousled ebon hair falls in uneven strands 
about her face, ending just below her pointed chin. Her wide 
eyes are set deep in her otherwise angular features, a pale 
violet hue that contrasts oddly against her tanned complexion. 
An unstudied grace pervades her movements, with a feminine yet 
limber frame that is more toned than muscular. Her hands are 
slender, with short fingernails that look ragged and oft-bitten.

a stern faced male elf~
A stern faced male elf with straight black hair stands here.~
   Even with a heavier build than most of his kindred, most men 
would still consider this elf to be quite thin. Sharp cruel opal 
eyes stare out at the world, constantly on the move and alert. 
His face is without blemish, the skin as smooth as a newborn's. 
His ears slope upward into a point while straight black hair 
partially obscures them. No hint of emotion flashes over his 
face as he keeps his silent vigil.

Rebki Boltdigger dwarf barrel chested bearded balding~
a barrel-chested, thick bearded dwarf~
A barrel-chested, thick bearded dwarf with balding hair hunches here.~
   Only standing a little over half the height of an average man, 
this dwarf more than makes up for his height by the sheer bulk of 
his body. Stout arms reach outward from his barrel-chested torso 
with gnarled, thick-skinned hands. His legs are short but 
enormous almost to the point of being overly bulky, bowing 
slightly giving him his hunched appearance. Deep, wide opal eyes 
sit below bushy eyebrows. His nose is wide, appearing squashed 
against his face. A thick brown beard that runs to his belt, 
kept neat and tied at the bottom with a leather band obscures the 
rest of his face. His hair is long as well, yet is starting to 
bald directly atop his head, the top of his scalp visible when 
not hidden by a helm.

A yellow-toed lizardlike creature lurks here.~
This creature is large, about the size of a human and standing upright.  It is lizardlike and green with yellow streaks running down its sides.  It has a pointed head and sticky pink tongue that occasionally flits out and back in.  It has bright red eyes that gaze out keenly.  It has a large tail that helps it keep balance atop its little yellow froglike toes.  It stands guard here over the place.

a strong-armed, bushy-browed male dwarf slouches here.~
   This dwarf is about half the size of an average man, and as 
wide as it is tall. It's shoulders are broad, it's chest thick. 
It has strong arms and a powerful overall build. It has thick 
hands and a rough skin, marred with scars and nicks all over. He 
has short legs and almost no neck giving him an overall stocky 
appearance. His rounded face ends in a long beard, dusty brown 
in color. Atop bright hazel eyes are mounted bushy brows of 
treebark brown, and below them a flattened nose. He has a full 
head of bushy brown hair and it runs along his face all the way 
down past his waist to the end of his beard.

   This large group of men are all fairly muscular and strong. 
Most are bearded, though an occassional clean-shaven crewman can

hard life on the seas, they man their stations dutifully, rowing 
the large oars of the ship.

A slightly-overweight man with greying hair is here.~
   Greying hair, neither thinning nor receding, tops the head of 
this man. Deep brown eyes gaze out from a weathered face. His 
lips are slightly cracked and, although shaven, he has a stubbled 
chin. This man is slightly-overweight, but not to a degree that 
would hamper his abilities. His thick arms are very muscular and 
he appears quite strong as do his stocky legs.

a heavy-set, grey-haired man with a moustache~
A heavy-set man with grey hair and a moustache stands here.~
   Slightly overweight, this aging man has a jovial manner. His 
brown eyes look out from his chubby and weathered face. A grey 
moustache, the same shade as his hair, tops his upper lip. 
Unlike his body, his hands are thin, and he appears to be missing 
a finger on one hand. His arms are fairly muscular, but not 
overly so, much like his legs.

a middle-aged man with large blue eyes~
A middle-aged man with large blue eyes stands here.~
   Large blue eyes stand out from this man's face and suggest a 
fiery nature. His hair is starting to grey a bit but still shows 
its original brown color as well. Slightly thin, this man is 
otherwise of average build. He appears to be middle-aged, 
perhaps even a bit on the high side. He has somewhat thin arms 
leading to moderate-sized hands which show a few wrinkles but 
otherwise do not look weathered or calloused.

A burly sailor stands here.~
   This burly sailor is one of several that man the ship tending 
the sails and rigging, cleaning the deck, and carrying out the 
necessary chores of daily operation of the ship. He is a 
muscular man, well-built for physical labor and the rigors of 
life at sea. He hurries about his duties, set on what he must do 
as part of the crew if the ship is to operate efficiently.

a black-bearded man~
A black-bearded man with a weathered face stands here.~
   A pair of deep-blue eyes look out from the weathered face of 
this man. His skin, parched from exposure to the elements is 
rough-looking, though not to the point of being unattractive, and 
has a fair tan to it. He wears a deep-black beard, matching the 
color of his hair, which is well-groomed. He is somewhat tall 
and solidly built with well-muscled arms and legs. His large 
hands appear weathered and slightly calloused yet nevertheless 
nimble.

a scant, slant-eyed woman~
A scant, slant-eyed woman stands here.~
   Although her figure is light and seemingly weak, this woman 
has a sleekly contoured musculature that can be seen upon close 
inspection of her almost ghoulishly pale skin. Deep brown eyes 
drive out from under curls of raven black hair which cover her 
head. Slightly rosy cheeks do little to diminish the contrast of 
her blood red lips and otherwise colorless complexion. Her sharp 
jaw and chin are pronounced, yet overly harsh to ever qualify as 
graceful. Upon looking at her hands, the space normally reserved 
for her middle fingers have been replaced by two small stumps, 
appearing to have been roughly severed.

A hale, powerfully-built man stands here sternly.~
   This man is rather tall and muscular. His body is covered in 
thick, sinuous muscles that frame his tall, stocky visage. His 
face shows no emotion and his complection is very cadaverous. 
His hair is well-kept and pitch black in colour.

a savage-eyed pitch raven~
a savage-eyed pitch raven flies overhead~
   Eyes that sink into a depthless black void peer savagely from 
the sleek coated head of this bulky bird. Large shimmering black 
feathers cover the bulky mass of this feral looking animal with a 
lustrous sheen of protection from the elements. Claws set in the 
meaty feet under the raven are long and curved wickedly like 
talons, thick enough to dig into anything soft or unprotected. 
The most prominent of all the raven's features is its cruelly 
hooked beak, the outline visible from any angle to hold no 
emotion save for unnatural malice.

carriage MERCHANT_FEDERATION decorated horse-drawn Malredteam~
a large, decorated horse-drawn carriage~
A large, decorated horse-drawn carriage of darkly-stained oak waits here.~
   This large carriage is obviously used for the transportation 
of goods rather than passengers. A team of four, powerful 
looking horses are hitched to the front, each wearing a 
dark-green horse blanket with gold trim. The oak panels of the 
carriage have been stained a rich-dark hue; a large hinged door 
with a brass latch allows access to the interior. On the sides 
of the carriage, where one might expect to find windows, 
shield-shaped crests have been artfully painted with a stylized 
coat-of-arms depicting three vertical panels, the middle one 
being somewhat wider than the others. There is loose, clean 
diagonal hatching across the space of the outside panels, giving 
the suggestion of shading. In the middle panel is engraved a 
simple, iconic rendering of the Dome of Stars as seen from afar, 
with two hands clasped above it. Making up the border of the 
shield shape is a string of small, hexagonal-shaped coins. The 
carriage looks well constructed and suited to traveling long 
distances.

A noseless, skull faced man is here~
   With scars so horribly wreaked upon his face little of his 
humanity remains this man stares out from a torn face that has no 
nose. His disfigurement remains purely on his face however as a 
thick and menacingly built body compact with corded muscle sets 
him larger then most men. Beefy arms lead down to huge grime 
stained hands which have seen more dirt then water in their life. 
The black tangles of hairs, which appear to have never seen a 
comb, do little to hide the glaring blue eyes within his macabre 
scarring.

This tall, lithe man's gaunt-featured face is masked by a short-

each eye. His skin is cracked with age and lightly tanned and his
slightly-flacid, sinewy arms terminate in gnarled bony hands.

a barbed, black wurm~
A barbed, black wurm is pulsating here.~
   Almost as tall as a man, this writhing long mass of flesh 
seems to be an animal of abyssal darkness. The skin a 
translucent obsidian black that reaches forever inwards clashes 
with pure white ivory bone, jutting out in a series of barbed 
spikes along the torso. With each movements of the wurm the bone 
spikes writhe back and forth, gnashing together with a dangerous 
force. The mouth itself is wide enough to take in a deer whole, 
and rowed with a savage spectacle of vibrantly white teeth.

Kiras wavy-haired brown-eyed large man~
a wavy-haired, brown-eyed man~
A large fellow with brown-eyes stands here.~
   Wavy hair of a dark brown caresses the top and sides of this 
stout young man's head, falling around his ears carelessly. His 
deep treebark brown eyes stare out at the world under thick 
brows, which accent his fair skinned complexion. He has sharp 
features and a hawklike nose that give him a rigid appearance. 
This is somewhat offset by a build both large and lanky, long 
arms packed with muscle flowing down the sides of this rather 
tall man.

Grimlech hale, crimson-bearded dwarf~
a hale, crimson-bearded dwarf~
A copper-skinned, crimson-bearded dwarf stands here~
   A thick head of crimson-brown curls flow savagely about 
churning wildly in different directions ending about mid-back. A 
long, unkept beard extends down from his chin reaching to about 
where his long hair ends. Short, but burly this dwarf's muscles 
are massive and well-defined. The mesh of thick muscle can be 
seen throughout his entire body from his neck, to his thorax, 
down to his calves. Glossy black, bead-like eyes stare out from 
stoicly from his broad, heavily-scarred face. His entire visage 
has various nicks and scars over it and a black rune is tattooed 
onto his upper left shoulder.

a life-size, inflatable raven-haired, crystal blue-eyed maiden~
A life-size, inflatable raven-haired, crystal blue-eyed maiden is here.~
   Standing of short height, this inflatable doll looks just like 
a real-life maiden. Its straight, long raven hair falling 
loosely on its back while two strands of hair fall down the 
sides, framing its little, somewhat delicate looking face. It 
has two large, almond shaped, crystal blue piercing eyes and a 
fair, if plastic complexion. The blow-up doll stands proudly, 
its body mimicking feminine curves still in development.

Lenghune pale gaunt scar faced man~
a pale, gaunt, scar-faced man~
A gaunt, scar-faced man with pale skin stands here.~
   This man has the look of pestilence about him, his eyes are 
sunken in their sockets and of a dark hue, to the point that 
distinguishing their exact color is difficult. His features are 
quite bony, reflecting the overall gaunt construction of his 
body. His skin is pale, and the color of his face is very close 
to a stark white. Veins can be seen, bulging from the skin of 
his arms, neck, and legs when visible. Though he looks sickly, 
there is noticable muscle definition in his body. Hair, thin and 
grey, is apparent upon his head and falls to about his shoulders. 
A series of minor scars criss cross his face, dominated by a 
rather nasty looking one which runs vertically over his left eye.

a black, spherical interrogation droid~
A black, spherical interrogation droid floats nearby.~
   This droid is basically spherical in shape, a couple of feet 
in diameter. It is a shiny black with a silver strip around it's 
middle, dividing it into two hemispheres. Multiple appendages 
extend out from the robot, claws, pincers, needles and other 
diabolical things--all for the purpose of causing intense pain to 
its victims. It floats a few feet above the ground on a cushion 
of anti-gravity.

a horse-drawn, elaborate carriage of gold-laced rosewood~
An elaborate rosewood carriage is hitched to two grey-coated horses here.~
   This stunning carriage is somewhat circular in shape. The 
main body seems to be fashioned of pine, but mounted atop the 
curved wooden frame are extensions of rosewood, well-shaped and 
ordained with gold filigree. The body of the carriage has been 
carved to form the shape of eagles in flight, their wingtips and 
beaks touching to mark the boundaries of the carriage. The birds 
are shot with rich shades of brown and burgundy, set against the 
darker, blue background of the rest of vehicle. Two small, 
triangular windows are cut into either side of the vehicle, 
draped, from the inside, with velvet. The doors to the carriage 
are bordered by polished bands of metal, as are the edges of the 
seat at the carriage's front, from which the harnesses of the 
carriage extend. Hitched to the vehicle are two tall, 
grey-coated horses.

a sleek, black-maned young stallion~
A sleek, black-maned young stallion huffs spiritedly here.~
   Standing roughly at the height of a man's shoulder, this horse
maintains a proud and dignified facade. Its head is held high,
intelligent eyes glaring out into the distance, and a thick,
healthy-looking mane runs down the back of its neck. Its coat
appears well-cared-for, and a thick, knotted layer of muscle
ripples gracefully beneath its sleek skin.

cart PTIERNAN donkey-drawn small two-wheeled wooden Rawhide~
a small, donkey-drawn cart~
A small, wooden, two-wheeled cart is here, hitched to a donkey.~
   This small cart appears barely large enough to hold more than 
a single occupant or two. Obviously designed to carry cargo 
rather than people or livestock, the cart has two wooden wheels, 
each made from the same old and weathered wood as the rest of the 
vehicle. Hitched to the cart is a grey donkey, its coat a bit 
dirty and in need of grooming.

a chestnut-haired, blue-eyed man~
A blue-eyed man with chestnut hair stands here warily.~
   Chestnut colored hair, thick and well groomed falls about this 
mans face and is by far his most distinguishing feature. Eyes of 
a deep blue color offer a deep contrast to the chestnut hair 
which frames his slightly scarred and rugged complexion. His 
nose is somewhat pointed and his lips are drawn into an almost 
perpetually stern and unmoving line. He is purposeful and firm 
in his movement and rarely is he seen to slouch or stand aloof.

A beryl-eyed, moustached young man stands here.~
   This gaunt-featured man has a svelte build and possesses an 
air of regality, his movements measured and sure. His long face 
is of a pallid complexion, and is set with a pair of watery-green 
eyes. Beneath the hook of his nose is a trim, oiled moustache, 
pitch black like the remainder of his kempt hair, which is 
closely cropped to the dome of his head. He is long of limb, and 
is generally youthful in appearance.

A green-eyed cat stands here, its grey fur bearing a dull shine.~
   Shining dully, the cat's coat appears maintained and cleaned 
thoroughly. Sloppy stripes of varying grey hues run vertically 
along its body, and continues on to form rings upon its long 
tail. Below it's lambent green eyes, the cat's small pink nose 
rests atop the two curving contours dotted with whiskers that 
form it's upper lips. Two pointed and grey ears reside atop it's 
head, with tufts of long hair present inside them. Long and thin 
are its legs, with small paws.

#6Type: #0learn <specific language>

Your character has somehow picked up the rudimentary knowledge of 
another language in their travels, whether through study, travel, 
housing a stranger, or whatever other back-story you can think 
up. They only know a handful of words, but it is a good base for 
them to build up a greater proficiency with the language. 

This works for scripts as well. However, for it to work and you 
not to lose your coin, you _MUST_ already possess the literacy 
skill, either having selected it in character generation or just 
bought it. 

Make sure you're not hooded when you try to learn the language!

a slender, white-socked wolf~
A slender wolf with a glossy midnight black coat stands here stoically.~
   Standing about four foot tall this slender wolf stars 
stoically out with vibrant cerulean eyes. Its coat is a glossy 
midnight black excepting around its paws which fade to an ivory 
white. It has long pointed ears quirked slightly to the side, 
its gaze set vigilantly out, unmoved by all of which surrounds 
it.

wiry-maned obsidian-colored mare Forlorn~
a wiry-maned, obsidian-colored mare~
A wiry-maned, obsidian-colored mare is here, flicking its tail.~
   Of average bulk and graceful tone, this creature's coat and 
mane are well-groomed and cut, hinting that it leads a life of 
domestication rather than one in the wilderness. Standing tall 
on four muscular legs, there is no hesitancy or fear detectable 
in this horse's posture, seemingly ready to spring into a flurry 
of action and motion at a moment's notice.

A rather annoyed spider variable rests here malignantly~
   This spider is of freakish proportions, weighing around eighty 
pounds and roughly the size of a large horse. Thick, coarse hair 
covers the creature's entire body, from long, spindly legs to 
fat, corpulent thorax. Eight ink-black eyes look out at the 
world, merciless and malignant. From the creature's head a pair 
of oversized mandibles protrude, razor-sharp.

Its fine coat is a beautiful shade of brown and has a healthy

A long-suffering head nurse works hard to keep up with the patient load.~
   Dark hair falls haphazardly about this woman's long, weary 
face. Despite the toil that threatens to drag her down, her 
shoulders remain high and proud as she performs her duties. She 
stands at an average height, but years of low-end management and 
a job to be done have taught her how to command the attention of 
even those whose medical degrees have given them a false sense of 
their own worth.

an owlish, straight-backed old man~
An owlish, straight-backed old man stands here.~
   This man is rather narrow of frame and build and seems to be 
getting on in years. While not blatantly old yet, he seems to be 
past his prime, his face beginning to become heavily lined and he 
moves with a careful sort of posture. His wrists and ankles are 
thin, his features slightly sunken. Despite this, the man 
usually carries himself with a bright, cheery demeanor. The 
man's hair has long since gone white but his eyes are still a 
pleased brown.

a stout, rust-red haired older man~
A stout, rust-red haired older man is here.~
   Flabby cheeks and deep laugh-lines give his face a look that 
tells of many years of enjoying life. His head is covered in 
rust-red hair that is kept braided and falls just to his upper 
back. Beneath this carefully braided hair, are a pair of deep 
set misty blue eyes. A mouth with firm lips and a rounded chin, 
completes this mans pleasing face. From his square shoulders and 
arms with large biceps, to his calloused hands, he seems well 
built. His stocky body with its barrel-chest is hairless, but 
his waist is a little paunchy.

a blonde-haired, vibrant blue-eyed man~
A young man with blonde hair and vibrant blue eyes stands here.~
   The most noticeable feature about this man is the easy, 
laid-back manner with which he carries himself. Beneath the 
man's vibrant, clear blue eyes lays a generally amiable smile, 
despite the frequent scarring about his from various 
combat-related wounds. He stands slightly shorter than is 
average, his hair hanging about his features in a rather foppish, 
mop-esque cast.

WATCH_KARRIKER_PLOT lean physically sculpted man~
a lean, physically-sculpted man~
A lean, physically-sculpted man is here.~
   This man carries himself with a smooth walk, his lean form 
traveling with an ease of motion betraying a well-toned and 
muscled body. While lean, rather than bulky, he has a lithe 
musculature to him--easily seen, when his flesh is bared to view. 
His hands have long, tapering fingers that are well-calloused 
with the small scars of day-in, day-out work. Other, larger, 
scars mar the rest of his form displaying an at least cursory 
familiarity with battle. His hair is a common, rather bland 
brown and it has been shorn to hang no longer than his ears above 
green eyes. His posture and mannerisms are ones of prim

Misair pearl eyed old woman archaic bearing stature~
a pearl-eyed old woman of archaic bearing and stature~
A pearl-eyed old woman of archaic bearing and stature is here.~
   This old woman, a wizened old crone, walks in a perpetually 
bent posture. Stringy, straggly hair hangs over her features in 
a tangled and nettle-strewn curtain that often-times shields the 
old woman's eyes from view. Her form is skeletal and emaciated, 
teeth yellowed and numbering only on one hand, such as they are 
visible when she offers a leering grin. Behind the tangled mass 
of her hair, the woman's eyes are a milky white, marking her as 
one of the blind. Her fingers are bent and gnarled with age, 
more claws than human appendages with stained fingernails.

a plump, grey-eyed man~
A plump, grey-eyed man lingers here.~
   Standing slightly shorter than the average Gondorian, and very 
much shorter than the average Dunedain, this man's black hair is 
long and combed into a vague attempt at neatness. His skin is 
pale, with only a hint of color from time spent outdoors. His 
figure is plump, and has veered away from a powerful musculature, 
to one showing sagging flesh. His face is angular and his dark 
grey-blue eyes are shaded by the shadows from his brow. His nose 
is long and thin with a slightly curved tip and a wisp of a black 
moustache is above his thin lips.

A well-aged woman with tawny hair stands here.~
   This woman, while well passed her prime, seems to have aged 
with a sort of easy grace, the lines on her features seeming to 
gently accentuate them rather than take away. Her form, while 
plump, still manages to be easily acceptable and no sag lines are 
seen. Her hair is a tawny sort of gold, her eyes a mild brown, 
and she carries herself with a casual confdience.

a voluptuous stripper~
A voluptuous stripper dances here in the cage.~
   This incredibly sexy young girl is probably just out of high
school. She has long hair which she has braided into pigtails. She
has thin eyebrows, a narrow nose, pretty blue eyes which have just
the perfect amount of mascara on the lashes. Her high cheeks lead
down to thick, rosey pink lips. She has a well endowed chest, which
is almost too big for her slender body. Her long, curvy legs seem to
stretch on forever as they lead up to a plump bottom. She carries the
sweet fragrance of perfume at all times and goes about her routine 
with a 'come-hither' smile.

A slender fellow with a chaotic riot of copper-hued braids is here.~
   Numerous long, copper-hued braids dangle in a thick, chaotic 
riot all about this young man's open face, his tanned, 
weatherworn features sporting a meticulously-kept moustache and a 
matching goatee of several inches. Slender eyebrows, often seen 
curiously arced, lie above a pair of gleaming green eyes. His 
nose bears a slight crook, as though it has been broken in the 
past, and below it, his narrow lips are occasionally seen 
upturned in a jovial grin or casual smirk. He is of a relatively 
slender build, though taller than the average man, and carries 
himself surely.

the ethereal effigy of a black-winged beast with a snake-like head~
The ethereal effigy of a black-winged beast with a snake-like head flies here, its wingbeats creating nothing but dead silence.~
   Gazing at this creature is utterly disorienting because, save 
for the eyes of it, it can be seen straight through. The 
creature's massive bulk is composed of a sickly pale-blue light. 
At first glance it would appear to be a miniature replica of the 
dragons of old, resurrected in spirit form--its once-black, 
leathery flesh writhes and contorts still as if the creature 
still had bones and muscles. The eyes, coals of raging blue 
light, gleam with an unmistakable malevolence, a hatred for all 
that still lives. The ghostly head is secured to its body by a 
long, snake-like neck, its maw filled with fangs that gleam with 
an otherworldly light.

This large crowd of people are dressed well, some alone with
just a guard, and others in a group. Men and women alike are here,
all gaily talking, arguing, and chattering, most of them talking
about the theatre itself and the performances.

a scrawny goblin child~
A small and scrawny goblin child skulk around here.~
   A thin and malnourished wiry body with a dark-grey skin-tone 
of dusty wet rock carries this goblin child that with a swollen 
belly and constant submissive cringing appears to be far down on 
the pecking order. His face is elongated and below two thin 
eyebrows extends a long, sharp nose. Yellowish, sharp teeths and 
a shockingly red tongue hide behind thin and wound-crusted lips. 
The hands are bony and seem large and clumsy in comparison with 
the rest of his body.

The bloodthirsty shade of a hulking, scar-faced orc is here, its form transparent and insubstantial.~
   A freezing cold follows the presence of this spectral orc as 
it stalks through the area, no sound ringing or jangle coming 
from the crude ringmail that covers its body. It seems to be 
mainly composed of a blue light, which tinges the objects that 
can be seen on the other side of it that same shade. The orc's 
features, even more so than usual, are twisted into an 
everlasting expression of rabid hatred, the blue light that 
composes it creating twin orbs of rage, in replacement of its 
eyes.

The ethereal form of a lean, bloodshot-eyed goblin stalks through the area.~
   This goblin, armor and all, is utterly transparent. It seems 
to be composed of blue light, tinging the objects seen through 
its form this same color. The blue light seems to focus and 
condence on this goblin's features, its eyes having been replaced 
with two glowing spots of pure malevolence. Its features 
themselves are twisted into a perpetual expression of unearthly 
rage at all that it sees. The armor that it wears seems to have 
become a part of it, rather than something it wears--There is no 
jingle or creak from the buckles and straps of the light, crude 
leather that covers it. Its footsteps leave no wake behind, save 
a chilling coldness to the air.

goblin mangled ethereal form~
the ethereal form of a one-eyed, mangled goblin~
The ethereal form of a one-eyed, mangled goblin stands here, glaring.~
   This goblin, armor and all, is utterly transparent. It seems 
to be composed of blue light, tinging the objects seen through 
its form this same color. The blue light seems to focus and 
condence on this goblin's features, its eyes having been replaced 
with two glowing spots of pure malevolence. Its features 
themselves are twisted into a perpetual expression of unearthly 
rage at all that it sees. The armor that it wears seems to have 
become a part of it, rather than something it wears--There is no 
jingle or creak from the buckles and straps of the light, crude 
leather that covers it. Its footsteps leave no wake behind, save 
a chilling coldness to the air.

the transparent form of a filthy, rageful orc~
The transparent form of a filthy, rageful orc is here, objects visible through it.~
   A freezing cold follows the presence of this spectral orc as 
it stalks through the area, no sound ringing or jangle coming 
from the crude ringmail that covers its body. It seems to be 
mainly composed of a blue light, which tinges the objects that 
can be seen on the other side of it that same shade. The orc's 
features, even more so than usual, are twisted into an 
everlasting expression of rabid hatred, the blue light that 
composes it creating twin orbs of rage, in replacement of its 
eyes.

the gargantuan spectre of a massive troll~
The gargantuan spectre of a massive troll lumbers through the area.~
   This massive troll lumbers through the area at a generally 
slow pace, its long arms almost dragging the ground. It is as 
tall as some of the nearby surrounding buildings, were it to 
stand and walk straight, rather than in its perpetually 
hunched-over posture. Its flesh, once a dull gray, is now a 
transparent, unearthly blue, giving any voyeurs the chance to see 
objects straight through it. It wears no armor, save for that of 
a loincloth strapped about its waist.

   An assorted, crazed mass of orc-kin are here, pounding up and

two hundred or more of the filthy, armored creatures as they 
charge rapidly towards you, weapons upheld as battle cries rise, 
piercing and terrifying from the pack.

Sarnev midnight imposing man haired~
a man of imposing form and midnight hair~
A midnight-haired man of imposing form stands here.~
   This man is composed of broad, wideset shoulders and a muscled 
girth. His hair is dark and his features tanned, the man's eyes 
themselves a bright, fierce blue. The man's features are broad 
and seemingly open enough, with a wind-hardened look about them. 
His hair is worn in a careless manner, hanging down about his 
shoulders as he moves. The hands of the man are calloused and 
scarred from a life of work, the little nicks and scars one picks 
up from manual labor easily viewable. Overall, he presents a 
rather imposing form--he walks with an easy confidence, and a 
lithe smoothness despite his bulk.

A spindly, hawk nosed man stands here.~
   This man's form is spindly, his arms, legs and fingers all 
unnaturally long and thin. Long black hair touched by grey hangs 
tied from a ponytailed knot set atop his head. His face is 
compact, with thick eyebrows perched above a set of penetrating 
striated grey-black eyes. A large nose shaped like a hawk's beak 
disproportionally extends from his face. His features are worn, 
bearing the wrinkles and leathered skin of a man in middle-age.

A full-figured woman with a tousle of ebony hair stands here.~
   Her full face framed by a thick, full mane of ebony hair, this 
woman stands a bit shorter than the average man. This woman 
bears eyes of slate grey, flecked with green, set under 
meticulously kempt eyebrows. A set of large, sultry lips curl 
beneath her nose, offsetting her fairly weak chin. Her figure is 
healthy and barely plump, but her skin is immaculate, showing the 
care of an easy life and constant primping. A faint aroma of 
jasmine carries about her.

   This man's body is of heavy build and average height, his 
frame fit and well toned. A strong brow and lofty cheekbones set 
around a pair greenish-hazel eyes, the skin of his face tanned 
and shaved clean offacial hair. His face is held up by a strong 
cleft chin one that juts in a struggle to to match his nose. His 
arms are thickly haired and his forearms well defined. More 
often than not he bears a refined grin, one matching his stature.

a stalwart, cold-grey-eyed man~
A stalwart, cold-grey-eyed man stands here.~
   This man of stalwart build, still in the early prime of his 
life, stands at a more than average height for one of his people. 
He is fair-complected, though the firmness of his features lends 
his countenance a darker cast. His narrow, sunken eyes, set 
proportionate to the rest of his visage, are a cold, pale grey in 
hue. They are divided by a straight, thick nose that joins 
sharply with the hard ridge of his brow above. He is crowned by 
a head of coarse black hair, shorn short, that circles his ears 
and sweeps down the length of his jaw in the light dusting of a 
beard. His hands are calloused and worn, and a scar marks the 
right of his neck, trailing down to his shoulder.

a small grey tabby~
A small grey tabby watches with feline eyes.~
   This small cat looks to be nearly an adult, but its body is 
smaller than average for its age. Grey in colour, it has the 
markings of a tabby, with darker grey stripes cascading off its 
back and down its sides. The colour of its fur gradually fades 
to a greyish white on the underside the cat. Its long tail is 
striped in rings of deep grey, and its tail is capped in the same 
colour. The cats paws have little boots of white fur. Its ears 
are tall and perky, its nose dark and pink. Eyes of bright green 
look about with the awareness that only felines possess. It has 
long, healthy looking whiskers, and a thin M shape of dark fur on 
its forehead. It moves lithely with feline strength and grace.

Ostler Allen NEWBIE whip-thin mop-hair adolescent~
a whip-thin, mop-haired adolescent~
A whip-thin, mop-haired adolescent tends to horses here.~
   This boy, in the middle of his years as a teenager, is as thin 
as a whip handle, and just as agile. The skin of his torso 
clutching tight at his ribs and his stick arms and legs bearing 
next to no muscle. His hair is the most expansive part of his 
body, the dirty-blonde mass tangled and looking much like a mop 
atop of his head.

a fiery-eyed, roan stallion~
A fiery-eyed, roan stallion stands here.~
This stallion has obviously been bred for bulk rather than speed, the horse's chest thick and muscular, this trait continuing down the horse's body, its strength evident. His eyes hold a fierce spirit for those that look towards them, their brown fired with an aggressive fighting light. This stallion has just reach adulthood and is, as of yet, scarless.

a man of thick proportions and ruddy complexion~
A man of thick proportions and ruddy complexion stands here.~
This man has a permanently ruddy, reddened complexion, most noticeable throughout his face and upper body. He is of wide shoulders and thick wrists, the muscles about the man's form of the obvious, flexing sort rather than in the lithe class. When he moves, it's more of a lumber than a stride, and his eyes are rather close together, giving him an almost permanently squinting look. Overall, the broad man with the small, squinty eyes, seems to have created an almost comical comparison.

A looming man stands here, a large flat nose defining his features.~
   This man looms over the average human, tall and slender with a 
hunched back and shoulder slightly curled forwards. Greasy brown 
hair reaches down towards his shoulders, framing the face that is 
dominated by a large, flat nose. A thick beard surrounds a wide 
mouth that displays several missing, black or dechipped teeth.

a terribly diseased, golden-eyed warg~
a terribly diseased, golden-eyed warg looms here.~
This gigantic warg stands nearly five feet at the shoulder, its fur black as pitch. Yellow eyes, striated with enflamed blood vessels, focus with a frenzied stare upon all that stand before it.  The right side of its face sags beneath puckering black wounds that ooze a white mucous over its fur and down to travel in tributaries between its yellow fangs.  The skin around the infection hangs loose, causing its brow and jowl to droop over part of one eye and its lips.  Its right hindleg and snout suffer from a similar malady.  The rest of its coat is greasy and unkept, sticking to the thick muscles beneath its haunches.  It smells of death and something sweet and coppery.

A middle-aged, leathery-skinned woman with muddy-brown hair stands here.~
   This woman is of average height. Her skin is tanned and 
leathery, showing the signs of weather and battle both which 
makes her age hard to guess. Cold, slightly narrowed brown eyes 
watch her surroundings with scrutiny. A sharp, arched nose 
sticks out, a bit overly long. Thin lips surround an imperfect 
set of teeth, some chipped and slightly broken. Her straight 
dark brown hair is flat with little luster and is cut short at 
chin level. Her body is well muscled even in comparison with men 
of her size leaving little left in the way of curves. Despite 
her bulk of muscle she seems to be rather agile.

A young goblin with one ear skulks here.~
   This young goblin has a perpetually hungry look about him. 
His hair is dyed a blood red and sticks up in short, greasy 
tufts. His eyes are a jaundiced-yellow and his skin is colored a 
dark green, mottled black here and there. He seems quite sturdy 
and his hands are callused and scarred-- though his fingers seem 
unnaturally long and nimble. A tattoo depicting a coiled snake, 
done in bright red ink, lies just below his right eye and three 
short, straight scars run across both his wrists. He has two 
small, sharp fangs, the tips of which barely poke out from 
underneath his upper lip. His left ear is rather large and has 
the tip torn from it. In place of a right ear, this goblin bears 
recent scarring to the right side of his skull and face.

   This man is truly an incredible hulk - rippling muscles on 
every bone and a sculpted physique. His hair is long and blonde

covered in scars.

a brown-hued man of common build~
A brown-hued man of common build stands here.~
   This man appears to be of common enough Gondorian stock, a 
short amount of brown hair covering features over mild, 
controlled brown eyes. His features have little that make them 
remarkable or particularly memorable, his eyes set at an even 
distance apart. The man's lips are neither overly full nor 
parsiminous, but simply present. When clothed, there are still a 
few scars that can be seen about the man's form, most of which 
seem to come from living in rough surroundings. The man's skin 
is tanned without being leathery.

An austere, shaggy-hooved stallion stamps its hooves here.~
   A towering creature of proud lineage and sharply-defined 
features, this Graehim stallion maintains the breed standard and 
is a standard of excellence for all equestrians. The majority of 
this animal's coat is a deep sienna that is upset by small 
patches of ebon along its chest and hind-quarters, and most 
noticeably by the almost pure white socks that encompass its 
powerful, shaggy fetlocks. At nineteen hands high this animal 
stands above most horses, with impressively large hooves. It is 
a collected animal, impressively and decidedly meant as a 
warhorse.

A light-skinned, athletic-featured man is here.~
   This middle-aged looking man has fair features, skin smooth 
besides the occasional small scar spotted about. He is quite 
tall for most, his frame toned and athletic in appearance. His 
oddly colored grey-hued eyes stand out in his pale complexion. 
Dark hair trimmed neatly and short, this man has a clean shaven 
neat appearance. His jaw set squarely and strong with a sharp 
nose. The scars spotted about his form barely stick out unless 
looked for, though one on his left arm is long and straight near 
the shoulder.

a time-withered old man of degenerated build~
A time-withered old man of degenerated build stands here.~
   This man, probably once a tall man of muscular, if narrow, 
build, looks to have been hard-done-by as far as the passage of 
time goes, his features lined deeply with wrinkles, the man's 
sharp blue eyes set deeply and his cheeks lightly sunken. His 
frame itself, while always on the narrow side, has been emaciated 
further by the passage of time and he's become even thinner, his 
wrists slight and fingers bony. The skin of his hands has become 
nigh on papery soft, and his hair has been bleached a pure white 
by the passage of time, allowed to float about his shoulders. He 
moves with the careful nature of the very elderly, though seems 
to be in good enough health aside from the obvious.

A pale, blue-eyed man with frost-blond hair stands here.~
   He vaguely remembered that other time, the time of fire. He 
had been a man then-- tall and strong with stern eyes and a 
quiet, lingering confidence; pale and with hair like shaved ice, 
his eyes just chips of blue frost set in a gaunt face. He had 
had a beard, pale-blond fuzz on his chin and cheeks, scraggly and 
itchy, coarse and short. His voice had been as deep and thick as 
port-wine then, and he had tasted ash.

   Tiny in size, yet very life-like this little doll bears a 
deranged look in her brilliant green eyes. Her pale skin-tone 
causes her scant frame to seem quite emaciated. Her skin and 
clothing are perpetually coated with flecks of blood, affording 
her a haunting appearance. Grimy, tangled brown hair falls down 
her back and strays into her eyes, obscuring her vision. Her 
lips often part into a haunting grin, displaying two rows of 
perfect teeth.

Her hair is grey and whispy.

A doughy-eyed, short brown-haired dachshund is here~
   This small dachshund stands on its hind legs, a large pie tray 
hangs from a leather cord around its neck. A selection of 
steaming pies sits upon the tray, teasing the nose with their 
meaty scent.

an armored squirrel wielding a black-steel longsword~
An armored squirrel wielding a black-steel longsword is here, looking for a kill.~
   This furry little animal isn't going to take your crap 
anymore. He's got a shining suit of armor encased around his 
coat, leaving his fingers open to wield his black-steel longsword 
that looks rather menacing. His brown eyes look emotionless and 
brown streaks run under his eyes. It's either his coat or 
warpait; you decide.

A shaggy, black and grey puppy stands here.~
   This puppy is a shaggy creature, his fur mostly a pale grey 
except for two large splotches of black over his striking blue 
eyes. His fur covers most of his body, save for a patch of his 
round dark stomach. The only other remarkable thing about this 
mutt is the size of his paws, which are much too large for his 
body.

A massive black and grey dog stands here attentively.~
   This dog is in the prime of adulthood has shaggy fur which is 
mostly a pale grey hue except for the two large splotches of 
black over his strikingly blue eyes. His fur covers his tall, 
muscled body, showing sighs of maturity. The most remarkable 
thing about this mutt is his size, as he reaches to the mid-thigh 
of someone with an average height, his paws quite large.

an aging black and grey dog~
An aging black and grey dog stands here.~
   This dog has shaggy fur which is mostly a pale grey hue except 
for two large splotches of black over his striking blue eyes, 
though the black splotches have began silvering in small 
sprinkles. His body is quite muscled and large, though he looks 
to be losing the healthy girth to deterioration of age. His head 
would reach to the mid-thigh of one with an average height, where 
it not held a bit lower, a clear sign of old-age.

Zagdula pDRAXX_ONLY war torn shock white uruk hai older~
a war-torn, shock-white-haired uruk~
A war-torn, shock-white-haired uruk is here.~
   Towering at a height taller than most men, one of this uruk's 
most eye-catching attributes is his shock white hair. Cascading 
down in a rough mane to just past his shoulders, his locks are a 
sharp contrast to his muscular pitch black skin. Scars are more 
apparent as ever as they trace a historical map across his body, 
betraying a life of combat, survival, and hardship. Intimidating 
red eyes stare aggressively from a war-torn visage, scattered 
with wrinkles. Jagged teeth are scattered within dried, cracked 
lips. There is some grace in his movement, but every action is 
powerful and deliberate.

Ballybog spindly mud-covered creature Admin-Eldritch~
a spindly mud-covered creature~
A spindly mud-covered creature is lurking here.~
  Rather odd-looking, this spindly animalistic creature is quite
small and slicked with layers of mud. With a body that is almost
completely round, it relies on long and skinny arms and legs to
support it's weight. It's head is supported without the benefit 
of a neck, with a pair of baleful yellow eyes set above plug
nostrils and a small mouth filled with razor sharp teeth. Sharp
claws spread out from it's hands and feet, providing a deterrant
to agressors.

camel spec-ops deceptively cuddly CAMELOFKHAMUL~
a deceptively cuddly camel~
A deceptively cuddly camel is here, watching.  Watching, and waiting.~
   This camel is not especially large as camels go, but is 
surprisingly cuddly, the brown fur which covers it not as bristly 
as it should be, and, indeed, quite soft. Even with the long 
neck and the large muzzle and odd features typical of its kind, 
it is surprisingly cute, but something about its eyes causes you 
to think that maybe, just maybe, there is more to this creature 
than meets the eye...

Jeeves By-vaire miniature holographic butler violet eyes elvish features~
a miniature, holographic butler with violet eyes and elvish features~
A miniature, holographic butler with violet eyes and elvish features stands pon a stone pedestal.~
Standing merely a few inches tall, this man of sorts bears a
slight resemblance to the Sindar elves. His ears are small and
pointed, though, perhaps a bit oddly, he is balding with rather
cherubic facial features. His small limbs are unmuscular and
his eyes are filled with a sense of purpose and duty. When he
does move, it is typically with an incredible speed and you
get the feeling he is not one to be trifled with.
