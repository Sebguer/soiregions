a long-eared, fat donkey~
A long-eared, fat donkey stands here impassively.~
   Smaller than a horse, this horse-like creature seems to be 
three quarters the size of a good sized mare. His extremely long 
ears stick straight up and are what makes this animal so readily 
to identify. The mane and tail of the donkey are very coarse and 
stiff. He has a soft brown coat covering his entire body, with 
the exception for his belly, inner legs, and muzzle, all of which 
are a pale-white.

a small, golden-brown field mouse~
A small, golden-brown field mouse clings to a stalk of grass.~
   No larger than a ball that could fit inside a closed hand, 
this field mouse is covered short, tawny fur with a white 
underbelly. Oversized circular ears swivel this way and that, 
while beady black eyes are set above a tiny nose that is 
constantly sniffing the air.

a massive, black-winged beast with a long, curving snake-like head~
A massive, black-winged beast with a long, curving snake-like head swoops here.~
   This creature at first glance would appear to be a miniature 
replica of the dragons of old, but its small head with beady 
black-eyes and its entirely black hide would tend to indicate 
otherwise. Its body is thick and solid and it is much larger in 
size then the largest of horses. Black, leathery flesh covers 
the beasts hide at closer examination and it lacks the scales of 
other reptiles. The creature has no front arms, but instead two 
powerful back legs upon which hang massive talons that could 
easily kill a man.

A miniature, black-winged beast with a reptilian build hobbles about here.~
   This creature at first glance would appear to be a miniature 
replica of the dragons of old, but its small head with beady 
black-eyes and its entirely black hide would tend to indicate 
otherwise. If allowed to grow to maturity, this beast could 
clearly be quite large, but for now it is only the size of your 
average dog. Black, leathery flesh covers the beasts hide at 
closer examination and it lacks the scales of other reptiles. 
The creature has no front arms, and its wings are not fully 
developed yet limiting it to gliding and hobbling about 
awkwardly.

an energetic, greyish-brown dog~
An energetic, greyish-brown dog bounds about here.~
   This medium sized dog has a wide head, with a short, strong 
snout, flappy ears and golden-brown eyes. One of his ears is 
partly missing, with a scar at the end. His mouth is slightly 
open most of the time, showing off two rows of sharp teeth. His 
thick, short fur is of greyish-brown colour, with snout and ears 
black. Standing on four muscular legs, with strong hindquarters, 
this dog can't keep still, sniffing the air, ears on alert, 
moving around.

A graceful, dirty-yellow dog pads about here.~
   The thick, dirty-yellow fur of this medium-sized dog consists 
of short, stiff hair. Small, dark-brown eyes look at the world 
calmly, while her wide head continues into a short, 
well-proportioned snout. The flappy skin at the sides of her yaw 
give her a sad appearance. Her wide chest and well-muscled legs 
suggests great stamina, padding about with grace and ease of 
movement

A striped, reddish-brown chipmunk crouches here.~
   Only somewhat larger than the size of an average man's fist, 
this small mammal's rapid movements often lead it to be seen as 
little more than a streak of reddish-brown fur, with a lighter 
stripe running down its back. Its thin legs end in tiny paws, 
and a short tail extends from its rear. It has small, rounded 
ears and a pair of beady black eyes.

   A striking example of its kind, this warg has dark black fur 
with some white streaks running through it. It stands nearly as

are controlled by strong muscle. It has dark and intelligent 
eyes situated above a mouth packed with razor-sharp teeth, and 
its general appearance and demeanor are quite vicious.

a strapping, moss-green-eyed man~
A strapping man with moss-green-eyes stands here.~
   Eyes of moss green peer out either side of a somewhat bent, 
previously broken nose, leaving its bridge slightly bumped. His 
complexion is fair and tanned in nature, with few blemishes and a 
short, ragged mop of golden hair sits atop his head. Sinuous 
arms and legs adjoin this man's bulky, strapping carriage that 
seems to widen towards hisupper body and chest.

Drodus old white bearded man~
an old, white bearded man~
A old man with a curly white beard stands before a herbalist's stall here.~
   A full white beard is upon the face of this aged man. It is 
not exceptionally long, but is thick and curly, streaked with 
grey and hints of brown in places. His head is bald and covered 
in several small liver spots. Dark eyes, extremely sunken and 
filled with wrinkles which continue across his hole face, are set 
next to a wide nose. His body is small and seemingly frail, 
though hints of muscles remain upon his arms and broad shoulders. 
He has darkly tanned skin, all of it calloused and extremely 
broken from many years of hard labour.

A scarred, burly orc lurks here.~
   This orc has a battleworn look about him, whether it is from 
the menacing look in his eyes to the numerous scars upon its dark 
flesh, its hulking form gives off an air of confidence and 
experience. Its muscles ripple about its stout body, and its 
fangs sit behind dark lips and a firm jaw. It is tall and has a 
commanding presence, its smell radiates through the air.

   Though more well-kept, this person seems like any normal 
human. With a watchful eye they keep their attention on 
everything around them. Any sudden movements attract the 
attention of this human quickly, as well as the faintest noise. 
Seemingly taught rigorously to be ready for anything.

missing eyetooth becomes apparent.

A Gothakra archer guards the fort here.~
   Bearing themself in what passes as a proud and confident 
manner for a half-breed, this individual is muscular and bears 
many scars, the sign of experience granted from previous battles. 
Possessing a discipline unseen in most of its race, this 
half-orc's enlarged jaw is set straight as they gaze with 
narrowed eyes over their surroundings.

a rope-lashed wooden mangonel~
A rope-lashed wooden mangonel rests here on its wheels.~
   This small catapult, a little longer than a dozen feet in 
length, is nevertheless the result of much painstaking work and 
care, the hardwood construction sanded smooth. The forward end 
of the catapult has a small hutch constructed upon it, housing 
the long throwing arm that runs the length of the frame, the 
leather bucket ending it designed for throwing many small rocks 
as opposed to one larger. Currently, the catapult neither wound 
or loaded, a set of four large wheels attached to it.

A Vanguard commander is here.~
   This soldier of the Gondorian military known as the Eastern
Vanguard looks busy and harassed, tending to the various needs
of the fort in their position as commander of the location,
their hair somewhat greying and features aged. Despite their
weathered appearance, this commander looks more than capable
of holding their own in battle.

A stout man with thick touseled hair stands here.~
   Thick curly hair, brown in colour lies on this mans head,
touseling down to cover his ears, and be sheared just above his
eyes. These are large and brown, set either side of wide nose.
His skin is leathery and well tanned, and in places blistered
or scarred. This look is accentuated by his stout build,
which gives a tough, weather feel to him. Though not old,
age has begun to work its way on this man, as deep lines 
wrinkle around his eyes and lips.

   A curly mop of fair hair covers this youths head thickly, 
sheared just above the eyebrows and hanging a little over his 
ears. His skin is slightly tanned, a golden brown colour, and 
upon his face is a small amount of slightly fluffy facial hair 
showing this youths age as somewhere in his mid-teens. He is of 
lithe build, and of not great height, though he does not look 
overly weak.

An ancient, silver-white hart stands here regally.~
   This stag is old, very old, and yet his coat is a healthy, 
glossy silver-white in color that almost seems to glow with a 
soft light. He has a pair of intensely piercing blue eyes, and a 
magnificent set of antlers sprouting from his head. His legs are 
long and slender, and ripple with hardened muscles. Occasionally 
he flicks his tail and his ears move about, alertly.

a large, umbral-furred wolf with golden eyes~
A large, umbral-furred wolf with golden eyes stands here.~
   Larger than its average bretheren, this wolf shows the signs
of being raised by the hands of men. Its head stands taller than
a man's waist, with mighty shoulders and a long snout. Deep golden
eyes set like coins in their spheres take in all that surrounds
it with a keen intelligence. One of its ears has been torn off,
half of it missing - a gift of tooth and claw. Thick, spiky fur
the color of deepest night clings to its massive form, ending at
the tip of its bushy tail with a brushstroke of white.

A small, tame bird with clipped wings is here.~
   One of Middle-earth's abundant avian fauna, this bird looks 
rather well fed and cared for, despite the evident clipping of 
its wings, preventing it from flying and instead forcing it to 
travel by means of its small feet. Of fairly unremarkable 
stature and graceful, streamlined build, this bird does not 
appear to be a threat to anything larger than a small mouse or 
rat.

a small, trained bird~
A small, trained bird is here.~
   One of Middle-earth's abundant avian fauna, this bird looks 
rather well fed and cared for, the feathers of its wings glossy 
in colour. Of fairly unremarkable stature and graceful, 
streamlined build, this bird does not appear to be a threat to 
anything larger than a small mouse or rat.

a tamed, young wolf~
A tamed, young wolf auto-create stands here.~
   This wolf reaches a little below the height of a man's hip, 
and looks to be rather well fed and groomed, its coat of fur 
sleek, much like its entire apperance. Comprised of compact lean 
muscle, and taunt sinew, it moves with a practiced ease, and 
seems quite easy in the company and presence of larger humanoids. 
This wolf also looks to be somewhat young, far from a pup, but 
not having yet reached full maturity either.

a rabid, frenzied wolf~
A rabid, frenzied wolf stands here.~
   This wolf looks to be on the verge of starvation, and its coat 
is patchy, large hunks of hair having fallen out. A vicious 
snarl constantly drones from its maw, filled with froth and 
spitting flecked blood. In this wolf's eyes are nothing but pure 
madness and hate, and a desire to feast on whatever stands before 
it.

A tall, wiry man with moplike hair stands here.~
This man is taller than most of his peers, with a lanky frame defined
by lean muscles and hard-callused palms. His forearms are consistantly
scraped, and have taken on a tone darker than the rest of his fair
complexion. His eyes are a vibrant blue, and his face is lightly
freckled. He looks to be in his middle years.

forward in a lope, dark skin criss-crossed with scars.

a huge black warg is here, snarling at passerby.~
   A striking example of its kind, this warg has dark black fur 
with some lighter streaks running through it. It stands nearly 
as tall as some men, larger than most of its kind, and its 
movements are controlled by strong muscle. It has dark and 
intelligent eyes situated above a mouth packed with razor-sharp 
teeth, and its general appearance and demeanor are quite vicious.

A stormy-eyed, middle-aged man lingers here.~
   Closely-cropped, velvet black hair lines the head of this 
tall, middle-aged man, framing his hawk-like features. His eyes 
are a stormy grey shade in tone, almost black, and are rimmed by 
careworn creases. His complexion is fair but hard and windblown, 
his lips pale. A pair of long, sturdy legs support his lean 
frame, and he seems swift of movement in spite of his age.

A huorn hides and waits here, for something to eat.~
   This tree is twisted, and blighted, half its bark burned off 
and much of the rest covered in writhing parasites. Foul 
smelling toadstools sprout from between its branches, and a 
scabby white lichen covers the lower half of the tree. Yet, most 
remarkable of all is the sluggish, yet inevitable movements the 
tree makes, stomping by on two legs formed from gnarled, massive 
systems of blackened roots, sweeping at anything before it with 
long, terrible arms of rotted branches. Despite its sickly 
appearance, the tree still measures at least ten feet in height.

systems of blackened roots, sweeping at anything before it with 
long, terrible arms of rotted branches. Despite its sickly 
appearance, the tree still measures at least ten feet in height.

a desiccated, piercing blue-eyed, sooty black-haired man~
A piercing blue-eyed, sooty black-haired man lingers here, its form desiccated with eyes that are glazed in a dark crimson.~
   Long, tangled locks of hair fall from this creature's head, 
pitch black with dirt and mud caked onto it. Its mess of hair 
would hang to just above his shoulders, but it waves unevenly 
about and sticks to its face. Where the shadow of its previous 
prominent feature, its piercing blue-eyes now have a dark crimson 
glaze over it and the veins in its eyes a watery black. A small, 
flat nose is raised above a pair of blue, bloodied lips. An old 
scar from his right eye down to his left shoulder has been 
reopened and dark blood has dried in rivers below the wound. His 
muscles are thick and well-defined due to the seemingly 
paper-thin, and translucent skin that now covers all visible, 
uncovered areas. The empty socket in his right eye wreathed in 
dark shadow, his left staring out blankly with an eerie soulless 
gaze.

a narrow-necked, reedy young man~
A narrow-necked, reedy young man stands here, perpetually wary.~
This man looks to be rather perpetually nervous. He shifts his weight, always in motion, always glancing around as he bustles around the shop. His wrists and neck are thin, the man's frame itself having an undernourished, almost skeletal look to it. His voice is reedy and thin, high-pitched and rather nasally.

   This tortured creature stands its ground, shaking with 
madness. Yellowed eyes are nearly opaque and striated with red 
varicose veins that bulge out of the eye itself. Its fur sags 
free of its frame like unfolded blankets, showing the bones 
beneath. Open sores have split back its fur at places, leaking a 
white ichor that has dried in some spots in a chalky film. Its 
teeth are covered in a black mucous, which leak in globules from 
its hanging jowls. Though emaciated, it moves with great speed 
and strength.

a large, fetid warg with wild eyes paces here, shaking.~
   Trembling from head to toe as if just immersed in frigid 
water, this warg stares back with feral, opaque eyes encrusted 
with chalky white goo. Its fur sags free of its frame as if the 
flesh itself has detached from the muscle and sinew beneath. Its 
entire underbelly is bereft of fur, covered in black and green 
pustules that leak a substance similar to what is found around 
its eyes. Strange bony protuberances stick out of from its brow, 
giving its face a sloped appearance. A pungent, sweet smell 
arises from its open wounds with such odor it threatens to 
overwhelm the senses.

a humungous diseased bear with a partially exposed spine lumbers by drooling and shaking~
   Once a healthy specimen of its kind, this bear has long since 
declined. Its muzzle has become thicker and distended, 
showcasing a powerful jaw whose bone sticks through flesh in many 
places. Its teeth are long and greenish-yellow, spotted with a 
white chalky substance. Its eyes have sunken back into its head, 
remaining as only two tiny black dots between a sloping brow. 
Thick fur still protects the corpus, but it has peeled away 
around the shoulders and back of its head as the bones have 
elongated. Its spinal column has punctured through the skin and 
fur of its back. Twisted a greenish black, it looks as if a 
large infection is eating this creature alive bit by bit.

a terribly sick rabbit with nasty big, pointy teeth is crouched here ready to strike~
   Pure white and covered in open, weeping wounds, this larger 
than normal rabbit is sick and dying. It trembles and shakes, 
causing its ears to twitch back and forth like the antennae of a 
grasshopper. Overly large incisors, grimy with black mucous, 
stick out from both jaws and cock-eyed angles. Once luscious fur 
clings to its angular skeleton, highlighting the physiological 
changes that have taken place since being tainted. Its front 
paws are wider, almost wolf-like, and its back legs have tripled 
in size. It jumps with great speed and accuracy upon muscles 
unnatural for its species. Red eyes glare back at you, striated 
with green varicose veins that have popped in two places beneath 
the onslaught of sores.

   Standing nearly four feet at its monstrous shoulder and eight 
feet long, this diseased specimen outweighs any others of its 
race. Entirely hairless, its skin has burst forth like an over 
cooked sausage, revealing black and green pustules and leak a 
chalky, white substance. This runs down its sides, drying into 
rivers of chalk. Instead of hair down its back, bristly spines 
have emerged who write and move on their own. Two large tusks, 
the size of a buck's antlers, stick out the side of distended 
snout. Tiny beady eyes that are sunken so far into the skull 
they are little more than pinpricks, stare out of this dying 
beast. It stands shaking and shrieking, enraged beyond reason.

a large, red bearded man with missing fingers stands here scowling~
   Standing tall at the shoulder and narrow at the hip, this 
scarred behemoth with red hair looks no stranger to harsh times. 
His brown eyes are cold and show little sign of what lies beneath 
the surface. Tanned skin is spread tight over a tall and 
muscular frame, given an almost coppery tone by the bright red of 
his beard and long hair. His left hand is missing three fingers, 
leaving only the index and thumb to live on. Never does he hide 
or attempt to conceal it, he displays it proudly for all to see.

A monstrous, iridescent black serpent lies coiled here.~
   This reptilian creature is huge, easily thirty feet long, with 
hard, shiny iridescent black scales all along its sinuous body. 
It has a broad, flat head, large dead-looking eyes and a forked 
tongue flicks in and out of its mouth over and over. There is a 
cold, calculating intelligence in its gaze, and when its lipless 
mouth opens, two large curved fangs appear, each more than a 
handspan long. It's muscular coils, a foot or so thick, could 
easily crush a grown man, and it moves with deliberate, fluid

ranger mob generic~
a generic ranger mob~
A generic ranger mob stands here.~
   This professional solider yields a healthy impression with a 
comfortable and practical clothing and a skin that carries a deep 
tan from years of outdoor activity. Of decent physical shape and 
size, and of mixed human blood without any racially 
distinguishing features. Scars and a certain determination in 
the eyes gives the impression that this person is trained for and 
familiar with violence. Dressed in natural and green colors, 
thick leather and wears the mark of Gondor.

Eoleod Stallion Black ill-tempered Horse XBLACKJACK~
a jet-black coated, ill-tempered stallion~
A jet-black coated, ill-tempered stallion stamps a hoof impatiently here.~
   Bred for war, this jet-black stallion has a brawny, strong 
back coupled with heavily-muscled shoulders and hind-quarters, 
with long legs that end with large thick hooves almost the size 
of small plates. The tail and mane are both formed of 
well-groomed fur, moderately short and yet soft to the touch. 
Two dark, clear orbs survey the world around him with impatience 
and disdain. Overall it is an immensely large animal, the 
breeding evident in its huge 19 hands of height.

a squat, piggish orc is here~
   Slightly bent over, but sturdy with a squat frame this orc 
bears a startling resemblence to a pig. His nose is short and 
turned up at the tip, and his flappy, thin ears protrude 
outwards. Despite this, he appears to be a strong individual, 
with a barrel chest and thick arms and legs. His teeth are 
yellowed, and in places cracked, but also appear to have been 
sharpened at some point.

a long, scaled reptile with a giant maw~
a long, scaled reptile with a giant maw lies here hissing~
At about fourteen feet in length, this giant reptile slides just above the ground or through the water on four stumpy legs and with the aid of its giant tail.  The top of its body is covered in armored ridges that stick up like blunted spikes and offer a fair deal of protection from its prey.  Its giant tail consists of over one-third of its length ans it thick and corded with muscle which aids in swimming.  A pair of black-eyes sit atop its head and face forward over its long snout.  A set of impression, jagged teeth protrude from its elongated maw - wide enough to take hold of prety twice its size.

a large, sleek black marsh cat~
a large, sleek black marsh cat prowls here~
Covered in a thick layer of sleek, pitch-black fur this large hunting cat stares back at you with hungry, green eyes.  Thirteen feet from head ot tail, its muscles ripple and bulge with even the slightest movement.  Large paws with retractable claws are slent upon the earth, able to propel it with great speed and its thick haunches hint at its great strength and manueverability in all types of terrain.  A short snout and tufted ears round out its face, with long whiskers that twitch with each sniff.  Four long canines, flecked with bits of its last meal, are flanked by smaller incisors and teeth meant to red and tear chunks of flesh.

feredir pofAngon lanky fluffy coated wuldane pup byIcarus~
a lanky, fluffy-coated wuldane pup~
A lanky, fluffy-coated wuldane pup roams about.~
Clearly fresh from the litter, this wuldane pup is little more than a fluffy mass of white fur. Sporting an oversized head, paddle-like paws, and lanky legs, any movement is likely awkward and uncoordinated at best. A pair of amber eyes look over a blunt snout, capped with an often wet black nose. A pair of triangular ears stand sentinel atop his head, with a thin stripe of black starting between them and running down the back of his neck before fading to the white that makes up the rest of the coat.

sac enormous fuzzy egg xSpiderxEgg xNauriel~
an enormous, fuzzy egg sac~
An enormous, fuzzy egg sac hangs from the ceiling here.~
   This appears to be an enormous mass of spider silk formed into 
a sort of nest. Through the filmy exterior of the thick webbing 
can be seen dozens of sticky, fuzzy-looking eggs, the smallest of 
which is the size of a human head. This sac is suspended from 
even more, thicker silk. Something this weak and frail is surely 
guarded from the shadows by what ever created it.
