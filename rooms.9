Base Room for Mordor~
   This is the base room for the country of Mordor, specifically 
Cirith Ungol, the Ephel Duath, and the territory east of Minas 
Morgul. 

Celedhwen, HaiWolfe, and Orden are currently working on this 
zone.

Narrow Ravine at a Landslide~
   A narrow ravine cuts through the black spires of the Ephel
Duath, the peaks of the mountain range standing against the sky
like the jagged teeth of some horrible flesh-eating animal.  The
ravine seems to travel east to west, but the way west appears
to have been blocked by a large landslide.
   A slights breeze stirs through the area, and whistles through
the boulders blocking the way to the west.

By tracing the path of the breeze, you find that it is escaping
between some boulders in the landslide.  It looks as if it may
be possible to squueze through a crack between the boulders and
continue east.

breeze landslide boulders~
   The landslide seems to have completely filled in the ravine,
but by following the stirring of the breeze you notice a crack
leading to the waste that it may be possible to squeeze through.

A Deep, Slanted Ravine~
   Cutting through the sheer pinnacles and peaks of the Ephel
Duath, this ravine runs from east to west, and seems to begin
climbing to the east.  The floor of the ravine is littered with
gravel and scree, which shifts underfoot and slows travel.  The
route to the west seems to be blocked, perhaps by some sort of
rockfall or landslide.

A Deep, Slanted Ravine~
   The sheer peaks of the Ephel Duath, the vast mountain range 
which guards the long west flank of Mordor, rise above in a 
vertical wall of basaltic cliffs. The ravine is sloped, rising 
as one travels further east. The floor of the ravine is very 
dry, and covered with loose stone and shifting gravel.

A Deep, Slanted Ravine~
   The jagged peaks of the wide, vast range of the Mountains of
Shadow rise all about this narrow ravine.  Also called the Ephel
Duath, the wide range makes a nearly impenetrable border defending
the western flank of Mordor.  This ravine, however, seems to be
slowly winding its way through it.  The ravine slopes, rising as
it travels further east.

A Deep Ravine at a Steep Stair~
   A ravine, deep and sloping downward to the west, winds its way 
through the steep peaks and pinnacles of the Ephel Duath. The 
mountains block all travel, and even all views beyond the floor 
and walls of the ravine itself. A curious stair carved from the 
black basalt rises from this point. It looks very steep, and 
quite exhausting to climb. It is impossible to see the end of 
the stair, despite the fact that it seems to be fairly straight.

The stair is almost impossibly steep, and one is often forced to

very narrow and uneven, making it even more treacherous.

   A steep, narrow set of stairs travels through the black spires 
and cliff-faces of the Ephel Duath. The steps are very narrow, 
and require careful foot placement to avoid a fall. The steps 
are also very steep, almost requiring one to use hands as well as 
feet to climb. The stair is straight, but so high as to be 
unable to see the top, although the bottom of the stair is 
visible some distance below. The steps are covered with a light 
layer of gravel and shifting stones.

Midway on a Steep Mountain Stair~
   The top and bottom of this treacherously steep stair can 
barely be discerned from here. Each individual step was carved 
from the native black-basalt unknown centuries ago, and the edges 
of each narrow step are worn and slick. Vertical walls of stone 
rise on either side of the stair, making a fall in those 
directions unlikely, but the stair is so steep that a fall to the 
distant bottom seems a real possibility.

High Pass at Top of a Steep Stair~
   Wandering among the tops of peaks and spires, this thin trail 
travels east and west. The trail is extremely exposed, with a 
steep drop to the south down into remote and desolate valleys and 
ravines. A city, black and ugly, with a tall central tower, can 
barely be seen squatting in the middle of a large valley below 
and to the south-west. 
   The trail travels to the east, winding along the flank of a 
black and barren mountain. To the west, the trail pass descends 
via a long and straight stair carved into the black rock.

Along a High Pass~
   Meandering along the flank of a mighty black, basalt peak, 
this trail climbs steadily to the east, its ultimate destination 
lost around the vast bulk of the mountain. A near vertical drop 
greets the careless with a mis-step to the south. Far to the 
south and west, an ugly city can be seen nestled down in a dark 
mountain valley. It would appear to be far below, and many 
leagues away. 
   The ledge is very narrow here, and a single misplaced step
could send the unwary tumbling down many hundreds of feet.

and sharp flakes of obsidian. The trail seems to rise at it

Mordor known as the Ephel Duath. The trail is very narrow, with 
the steep wall of the mountain on one side, and a near vertical 
cliff on the other. The trail rises as it goes north and south, 
further into the heart of the mountains. 
   The path here follows a very narrow ledge, and one must be 
careful not to misstep, and take a nasty tumble down the 
mountain.

   The wind at this elevation is cold and steady, whistling

Duath. A trail, narrow and treacherous, curves north and east 
along the flank of one of the higher peaks. The trail is barely 
visible, and tends to rise as it travels east, towards the center 
of the range. A cliff and sheer drop to the west restrict travel 
to the trail.

flakes cover the trail, making it shift easily underfoot. To the

to be a long and winding stair cut from the black basalt. A

with a chilly gale.

level, and seems to make directly towards a large buttress of 
stone which intersects the steep slope of the mountain. There 
would seem to be no way around this massive stone bulwark, which 
looms above as an even higher peak of black volcanic stone. 
   A stair, long and winding, descends to the west. Its steps, 
although worn, seem to have been carved by hand centuries ago.

and smooth, suggesting that it is not a natural feature, but
carved by some long forgotten hand.  The tunnel is perhaps fifteen
feet high, and around twenty feet wide.
   The darkness in the tunnel is looming and oppressive, made worse
by the rank and foul quality of the air.  The air, which has little
movement, carries a scent of ancient rot and mildew.  The air is
also surprisingly warm.

A Black Tunnel~
   Fetid, rank air smelling of ancient decay is carried by 
curious random breezes in this dank tunnel. The air is strangely 
warm, and seems to deaden all sound. The tunnel itself is some 
fifteen feet wide at the base, and arches to around twelve feet 
high. It surprisingly straight and relatively smooth, apparently 
carved unknown centuries ago through the black rock of the Ephel 
Duath.

   The air in this black tunnel is dank and fetid, so thick that 
one can almost feel it upon their skin. Many odors are carried 
on the strangely warm and random breezes that fill the air, but 
none of them are wholesome. The tunnel is slightly rounded, and 
climbs to around twelve feet high, and is some fifteen feet

Intersection in a Black Tunnel~
   This black, dank tunnel travels nearly due east to west 
through dark volcanic stone. The tunnel has a rounded cealing 
nearly twelve feet high, and is some fifteen feet across at floor 
level. The air in the tunnel is damp, somewhat warm, and carries 
on it a strange scent of mustiness and decay. 
   A void, in the form of a smaller side-tunnel, opens to the 
south. The stray breezes from that direction seem less corrupt 
and stagnant.

Over the Edge~
   Just overhead is the crumbling edge to a narrow trail nestled 
against the mountain. This is a very steep precipice, with only 
a few protruding bits of rock available as footholds. Succumbing 
to a life-threatening plunge is a simple matter of losing one's 
grip here.

A Sheer Mountain Face~
   The barren, unforgiving black rock of the Ephel Duath is 
none-the-less pitted and pocked in many places, allowing for a 
number of handholds to allow one up and down the sheer surface, 
the wind howling about the area here.

A Narrow Ledge~
   Protruding from the face of this massive, black mountain is a 
small ledge no more than a dozen handspans across. Both above 
and below is nothing but mist-shrouded air and sheer, unscaleable 
rock. Barely visible to the distant south are the craggy edges 
of a dark valley, surrounded by countless peaks and spires of the 
same color. Exposed to the elements, this shelf is windswept and 
shows signs of erosion at its edges. 
   The ledge continues a short distance to the east, clinging to 
the mountainside.

Along a Narrow Ledge~
   The ledge tapers down as it heads eastward until it disappears 
entirely, leaving only a long drop to the east and south. Strewn 
across the ground are shards of broken rock that appear to have 
fallen from above. A large slab of smooth, black rock leans 
against the mountain face. The air here is cold, as blasts of 
chill wind continually howl past.

A Cramped Tunnel~

faintly damp, musty smell hangs in the air, but does not 
overwhelm the senses. The ground, walls, and ceiling are all 
slightly curved. To the south, the tunnel comes to an abrupt end

Through a Cramped, Sloping Tunnel~
   This narrow tunnel is cramped and slops to the east, while to 
the west, it turns sharply. Its walls are quite damp, with the 
moisture possessed of an unwholesome, acrid scent; beads of 
liquid drip down the rough walls slowly. A musty smell blows in 
from the east, soothing the acridness somewhat.

Through a Winding Tunnel~
   This narrow passageway bends and twists at crazy angles through
the rock and dirt, heading vaguely north and east in a somewhat level,
if rough and crude, fashion. Moisture seeps down from the tunnel walls
to pool here and there in sickly, slick puddles that make footing
precarious for most, and everything smells acrid and rotted. A breeze
carries in from the east, but it doesn't improve the smell at all.

Turn in a Cramped Tunnel~
   A dank, narrow tunnel bends sharply here, heading east and 
south around a hairpin curve. It is a thoroughly unpleasant 
space, cramped and confining, with barely enough room to walk 
comfortably. Adding to the unpleasantness, the tunnel is quite 
wet and dank, with a thick, pervasive stench of acrid decay 
flooding through the air. Here and there, slick pools of liquid 
make footing difficult. Moisture drips and seeps through small 
cracks in the rough walls, dripping down into the puddles, though 
to the south, the noise is more definite.

before it dead-ends in all directions save to the south, where a 
faint breeze can be detected bringing a slight scent here. The 
walls and floor of the cave are rounded slightly, but even these 
are rough and organic-looking, with no evidence of being worked. 
A musty smell, as of years of neglect and disuse, pervade the

A Black Tunnel~
   Traveling east and west, this black tunnel, although fairly 
wide, has a stifling, oppressive feel. The darkness seems to 
crowd close about, and the air is moist, sticky, and filled with 
a rich and potent smell of decay, as well as a strange acrid 
scent. The sound of dripping water echos through the tunnel, and 
occasionally a strange skittering sound can be heard some 
unkowable place in the distance. The tunnel keeps its dimensions 
at around twelve feet high, and fifteen feet across at the base.

A Black Tunnel~
   Burrowing east to west, this tunnel is surprisingly straight
and smooth, suggesting that it is not a natural feature, but
carved by some long forgotten hand.  The tunnel is perhaps fifteen
feet high, and around twenty feet wide.
   The darkness in the tunnel is looming and oppresive, made worse
by the rank and foul quality of the air.  The air, which has little
movement, carries a scent of ancient rot and mildew.  The air is
also surprisingly warm.

A Black Tunnel with a Wide Tunnel North~
   A large void opens in the north wall of this arched passage 
which runs east to west. A stench is carried on the warm, wet 
air which emerges from the black, northern tunnel, a stench so 
noisome and foul that it is nearly overwhelming. The gap to the 
north appears to be a very wide passage, wider, perhaps, than the 
east-west passage. A constant drip can be heard from the north, 
which is echoed and amplified by the hard stone walls.

A Ruined Tunnel~
   Where once the black rock was carefully mined and the tunnel a 
proud piece of craftsmanship, now it is a series of collapsed 
sections of rock amongst rotting meat, old bones and the 
occasional animal nest. Seemingly a haunt for predators, large 
piles of droppings are heaped around.

A Low-Ceilinged, Sloping Tunnel~
   Steeply sloping, this tunnel is large enough to walk in, but
not much more. It runs downward to the west, but becomes more level
the further it runs. Not far to the west, it rounds a sharp bend.
An acrid, unpleasant smell pervades the dank, wet tunnel, carried
on a faint breeze coming from the west. Also perceptible on that
breath of wind is the soft sound of dripping water.

A Rough-Walled Tunnel~
   The black, volcanic stone has been roughly carved to form a 
poorly worked tunnel which runs north and south. The walls are 
especially rough, with jagged pieces of rock jutting out at odd 
angles. The floor is slightly better worked, and remains 
relatively even. The stench which fills the surrounding tunnels 
remains the same here. 
   The tunnel seems to intersect another, larger tunnel to the 
south.

A Rough-Walled Tunnel~
   The walls of this tunnel are only roughly hewn from the native 
black, volcanic stone, and are jagged and sharp. The floor is 
only slightly uneven, and seems to have been carved with somewhat 
more care than the walls. The tunnel is perhaps twelve feet 
wide, and nearly that many feet tall. It is uniformly filled 
with the stench of decay.

Turn in a Rough-Walled Tunnel~
   The tunnel turns here, heading to the west and south. The 
turn is not at all gradual or artful. It is sudden, making an 
almost acute angle and leaving a very jagged corner at the inside 
of the turn. The ceiling actually seems to lower a bit at the 
turn, comoing some ten feet from the uneven floor.

A Rough-Walled Tunnel~
   Maybe measuring some twelve feet across, this tunnel travels

of the Ephel Duath. The tunnel has only been roughly hewn from 
the dense black stone, and the walls and ceiling are jagged and 
poorly finished. The floor, while uneven, is slightly better.

A Rough-Walled Tunnel~
   Jagged black stone juts from the walls of this rough-hewn 
tunnel which travels through the bowels of the Ephel Duath. The 
ceiling and walls are especially poorly worked, where the floor, 
while uneven, is more or less smooth. The entire tunnel measures 
some twelve feet across, and only ten or so feet high. 
   The tunnel travels east and west, although the dim outlines of 
some sort of intersection can be seen to the west. A strong, 
putrid stench wafts through the air from that direction.

but the floor, while uneven, is more or less smooth. A rotting, 
putrid stench fills the air, so strong it seems almost tangible.

A Short, Rough-Walled Tunnel~
   The stink of decay, rot, and refuse fills the air, so strong 
that it's a taste on the tongue and an assault to the senses. 
Fine, silky webbing is snagged from the occasional outcropping of 
jagged, black rock that composes the roughly hewn tunnel, and 
brittle, yellowed bones are scattered here and there across the 
floor. The tunnel goes only a short way before widening to the 
south, where the stench is even stronger.

Chamber Filled with Rot and Decay~
   The stench of rot and decomposition pulses from this chamber 
like a physical thing, pushing forward in warm wave after warm 
wave. The floor is littered with the bones and shriveled corpses 
of thousands of creatures. Almost all of these corpses are 
wrapped in a fine, silk-like webbing, some of which looks almost 
brittle with age. The walls and floors are smeared with a 
strange, black-red substance that looks sticky. One can imagine 
that this is some sort of vile, bloody excreta. 
   Bones and corpses litter the floor.

bones corpses~
   Hundreds of shriveled corpses are strewn across the floor

is crumbling away to dust, leaving old bones and dessicated
flesh behind.

Branch in a Sloping Tunnel~
   Sloping sharply down to the south, the passage is round, and 
while not completely regular in shape, has a roughly round

which is completely devoid of any natural light. However, a 
pungent, almost acidic odor comes from a more level tunnel which 
branches off to the east.

   Just as wide as the main tunnel which this passageway leaves,

come from the east.
   A strange, off-white silk begins to line the passage to the
east.

   Silk threads cover the walls, ceiling and floor of the rounded 
chamber, which measures some forty or fifty feet across. The 
threads, which are a dirty, light-grey color, muffle sound, and 
give the chamber a quiet, almost dead feeling. Objects are 
embedded, or stuck to the threads at all locations: some stuck to 
the ceiling, others on the floor, and some awkwardly pressed to 
the walls. These rounded objects are also covered with the same 
grey-white silk. The chamber has a strong, almost acidic odor, 
which burns the nose.

stench imaginable, and is heavy with the scent of vomit, blood,
and the sickeningly sweet smell of decaying meat.  The air is
almost moist with the scent, and the ground near the lip of the
great pit is slick with foul pools of viscous fluids.  The great
pit is too wide to see across, and its far rim, if any exists,
is lost in darkness.

On the Walls of a Stinking Pit~
   A warm, fetid wind rises from the depths below, carrying on
it the unimaginably foul stench of decay and bloody excreta.  The
air is damp and heavy, and seems to cling to the lungs and suffocate.
The walls of the pit are tilted just outward from vertical, but are
still quite challenging to climb, with very few holds for hand or
foot.
   The top of the pit seems near at hand, while the bottom, if it
exists, is lost in blackness.

On the Walls of a Stinking Pit~
   The walls of this black, deep pit are near vertical, but angle 
slightly to the south as the pit widens near the top. Despite 
this slight incline, the walls are still very steep and difficult 
to climb, with very few places for a toe or hand to find 
purchase. The rough stone walls are smeared with a black, 
sticky, foul smelling subtsance. 
   The bottom of the pit, if there is one, is far below. A dank 
stench, strangely warm, wafts up from the depths. The top of the 
pit seems somewhat near at hand. It seems possible to traverse 
to the east from this point.

On the Walls of a Stinking Pit~
   Black, foul smelling, sticky filth clings to the rough walls
of this deep void in the earth.  The walls angle slightly outward
of vertical, indicating the the pit widens as one nears the top.
A stench of corruption fills the air so thick that it almost seems
to be a solid thing.
   The bottom of the pit seems near at hand, the floor thick with
a black ooze.  Above, the wall stretches on into darkness.

Bottom of a Filth Filled Pit~
   The bottom of this pit is some thirty yards across, and is
filled with a dark, viscous fluid which rises to perhaps ankle
height.  The fluid is nearly black and very sticky, and reeks
beyond all measure of waste, blood and rot.  The air here is
damp, warm, and heavy: so much so that it is difficult to breathe.
Scattered among the black filth are the bones of hundreds of
creatures, perhaps thousands, and what belongings they had which
have survived the passage of time.
   There is no exit from this chamber save for climbing the walls,
which angle slightly, but remain near vertical.  It is impossible
to see how high up the walls go from this point.

a few feet wide, which travels south into the very walls of the

western face of the mountain as it winds this way and that. To 
the west, and a couple hundred feet below, stand the gates of 
Minas Morgul set in a deep archway of stone. Strewn about the 
ground are shards of dark-hued rock varying in size, though most 
have been kicked to the sides of the trail.

by a blast of wind through the peaks of the surrounding Ephel 
Duath. Wide enough for only two persons to walk side by side, 
this trail cut into the face of the mountain curves along to the 
south and east. The view from here is dominated by the sharp, 
black mountain peaks of volcanic rock that are present in every

   The flat surface of this sizeable ledge has been cleared of 
stones and rubble, some of which has been piled up along the 
edges to prevent the unwary from falling off. To the north, set 
in the face of the mountain, is a jagged cave entrance that looks 
akin to a yawning maw opening into darkness beyond. The faint 
sound of voices and metallic clinking can be heard from within.

ceiling presses down oppressively as though the weight of the 
mountain is trying to crush those within. The cavern's entrance 
lies to the south, where glimpses of the sky and nearby mountain-
tops can be seen from the ledge. At the northern end of the cave,
a wide tunnel slopes downward into the mining shafts.

ordinary man, and it is uneven and jagged, sometimes jutting down
in sudden spikes. However, the cave is reasonably large, stretching
out in all directions in the gloom. At the far eastern end a small,
even darker passage leads off at a downward slope.

   This dark passage has been hewn from the red-black rock of the
Ephel Duath, leaving the walls uneven and rough. The tunnel burrows
ever downward at an uneven rate; mostly the incline is shallow, but
at times it goes shaper, or several roughly hewn steps seemingly
appear from nowhere. The ceiling here is low, adding to the humid
and oppressive feel of the tunnel. The still air has a foul, musky
odor to it, that of decay from years past.

motionless between the dark, jagged walls. To the touch, these
walls are slightly damp, covered in places by a moist algae. The
tunnel slopes at an ever uneven rate, and the ceiling changes
height just as often, sometimes forcing taller men to duck down
as they move. However, the tunnel remains silent and dark, all
sounds stifled swiftly by the air.

take a sudden twist, or a few crudely carved steps will head upwards,
but the general path continues east and downward. The walls are
jagged, and in places sharp - cut straight from the rock with basic
tools. The floor is much like this, making progress down the tunnel

   At both sides of the narrow tunnel are occasional small coves
burrowed into the rock. These are little more than a few feet deep
and are each filled with moisture, providing a breeding place for
mould and algae. As the tunnel delves deeper into the Ephel Duath,
the smell begins to increase - a foul odor emanating from within.
   The tunnel twists round sharply to the east and north before
continuing at a uneven slope.

trickles of water flow between the cracks down the slope.

off to the east through a small hole in the wall. A little further
north the tunnel suddenly widens, revealing an extremely foul
smelling chamber, little more than 20 meters across each way and
with a low, mould ridden ceiling.
   To the east a very thin passage has been cut from the rocks
and in the opposite wall, a small alcove has been dug.

feet but is quite a wide alcove. The ground is wet, and in places
puddles have gathered amidst the stones and rocks which litter the
floor.

boulders which cover up the back wall loosely.

   This tunnel leads from a small, low cave to the west, and it
twists quickly southwards, sloping downward in that direction. The
walls are very narrow and rugged, barely wide enough for one man
to walk down. At time the slope is sudden, with drops of a few
feet or one or two crudely carved steps. Heading southward,
deeper into the mountainside, the air is ever more stifling
and the putrid smell grows ever stronger.

   This passage slopes down to the east at irregular intervals,
sometimes dropping a foot vertically, other times remaining flat.
However, the floor is littered constantly with rubble, and as the
tunnel slopes deeper into the mountain, the bones of some creatures
are visible, the flesh rotted from the bones, leaving a foul stench
in the air.

A Widening Passage Twists to the South Before Forking East and West~
   This passage leads from the north, sloping upward to the south
as it continues in a straight line for several hundred yards. The
air in this tunnel is slightly cooler than the rest of the cave,
with odd cool breezes drafting from the heights of the tunnel. The
ceiling is not visible, obscured by the gloom, though it is clear
that it rises quite a height. Roughly cut from the rock, the walls
of this tunnel are quite wide, and the floor smooth. At the 
southern end of the tunnel, it sharply forks east and west - the
eastern route much narrower than the western.

   Seemingly a wide and airy passage, this tunnel slopes swiftly
upward as it twists southward. Blowing down the tunnel is a light
breeze which wafts away the foul, oppressive stench which lingers
to the east, where the passage slopes down. The floor of this

about from odd directions. At the western side of the cave a
tunnel leads, heading downward quickly. In this cave the floor is
wet and slippery, covered in a mould of sorts which becomes thicker
towards the murky pool in the east of the cave. The walls of this

A Breezy Passage Cut from the Rock Twists South and West.~
   A narrow tunnel twists and turns through the dark red basalt
rock of the Ephel Duath, taking the general direction of west one
way, and south the other. The tunnel remains mainly flat, though 
being hewn from the rock of the mountainside, it is not a perfect
floor - piles of dirt and rocks litter the sides, and the walls
are jagged and uneven. The air here is hot, but from the south
blows a slight breeze of cool air that fights with the foul
pungent stench of the rest of the caves.

A Cool Passage Continues Southward as a Stream Trickles Across.~
    At this point in the tunnel, it suddenly straightens out, 
leaving the twists and turns found previously to the north. However,
the same rough floor and uneven walls close in on this narrow and
dark passage. In the cracks and potholes of the floor, the beginnings
of a small trickling stream have begun with dark water dripping from
the ceiling and wall and forming little lines of water heading across
the passage.

The Passage Ends in a Low Cave with A Still Pool.~
   This cave is dank and smelly, with a low ceiling. It is quite
spacious however, stretching out close to a hundred yards in each
direction. On the western side of the cave, the uneven floor is 
lower, and has been flooded with a foul smelling, pungent pool
which remains unmoving. To the south, the roof of the cave slowly
rises, until in the corner a small crack is visible from which a
shaft of light shines, offering a tiny amount of light into the
otherwise dark cavern.

In the Slimy Water of a Pungent Pool~
   This foul smelling pool stretches at least thirty yards to the
north and south, while it is about half that distance east and west.
The water is still and putrid, covered in a thick layer of some 
kind of fungus. The pool is neither cold, nor exceedingly warm,
though beneath the surface the temperature seems to increase slightly,
and the occasional soft, slimy tentacle can be felt reaching from
the cave walls.

Under the Putrid Water of a Pool~
    Under the surface of this stagnant pool is revealed a murky
and oppressive world. The water is thick and dark, seeming to 
enter any orifice of a swimmer and plague them with constant
smell of mould and decay. The pool is not exceedingly deep, no
more than four yards, though the bottom is covered in a thick
layer of algae and mould which waves slowly in the water. To the
south and east the pool leads into an underwater cave, hemmed in
at the top and bottom, while above is an escape to the murky
and fetid swamp like pool.

its thick, mouldy nature. All around, on the walls and floor and 
ceiling grow all types of fetid wildlife, with long tentacle like
strands reaching about and waving in the water. The cave extends in

   This underwater tunnel is oppressive and cramped, with rough,
jagged edges to the wall which are covered in mould and algae. 
It is roughly circular, and only a few feet across, hewn from the
red-black rock of the Ephel-Duath in some ancient day. The water 
which has flooded this tunnel is thick and pungent, muffling
sound and sight alike. The tunnel leads north to a small opening, 
and continues further to the south.

looking little more inviting than beneath it. This pool stretches
only a few meters in each direction, making it roughly circular.
It is a similar depth, and in the western end of the pool, near to
the bottom of it, a narrow tunnel has been hewn into the rock,
leading to a dark, oppressive underwater passage.

the gloom. To the east the pool becomes shallower, leading to a land
point and a small dark cave.

the whole thing has been hewn from the red-black rock of the Ephel
Duath. All along the walls, ceiling and floor as long, deep gouge
marks. The floor is littered with bones, foul smelling corpses of
long dead creatures that ventured here. The smell is disgusting.
A long, slimy trail is visible about the cave, sticky to the 
feet of any who tread in the vile substance.

   Clearly the lair of an age old, foul creature, this tunnel is 
at least forty yards long, though only about five wide. It stretches
into the gloom, foul smelling air wafting from all directions. The
rough floor of this lair is filled with bones, cracked and crushed,
from age old meals. There is also piles of dry, white skin, long and
tough, left behind by some massive ancient creature.
   To the west the tunnel opens up slightly to reveal a wider cave.
While at the end of the tunnel to the east and foul smell comes,
despite no obvious exit being visible.

   Hacked out by some unknown agent ages past, this roughly 
circular tunnel cuts a path through the black mountains of the 
Ephel Duath, this section of the passageway high enough to 
accommodate the tallest of creatures, and is equally broad. 
Dank, humid air hangs heavy here, a foul, musty odour rising up 
to assail the nostrils, the pervasive stench amplified by the 
lack of wind or breeze this deep underground. Distant echos 
bounce across the jagged rock walls of the tunnel, faint 
near-sounds with no shape or texture.

bunch up at certain sharp twists of the path. An aroma of slow 
rot and decay, tinged with sweetness, drifts amongst the black 
rock of the tunnel, punctuated by the occasional waft of fresh 
air drifting in from some other section of the warrens. An 
earthy silence looms here within the walls, ceiling and floor, 
yet any sounds created from those passing through here echo 
loudly amongst the rock.

tight holes that require much scrabbling for those of a larger 
build to move through. Hairline cracks that spread through the

broken blades and ancient pommels, lurk upon the ground.

   Hacked out by some unknown agent ages past, this roughly 
circular tunnel cuts a path through the black mountains of the 
Ephel Duath, this section of the passageway high enough to 
accommodate the tallest of creatures, and is equally broad. 
Thick clouds of dust swirl in the air here, only the faintest of 
currents leaking into this portion of the catacombs, yet even 
this meager whispers of wind send the near-fog into occasional 
spins and spirals. Large, purple-black eggs cluster to the high 
segments of the tunnel here, covered in mucus and thousands of 
bumps and marks.

   Tight kinks and bends plague this subterranean shaft as it 
leads back dull, igneous rock. Many turns are pressed close 
together, both the ceiling and the walls compressing to form 
tight holes that require much scrabbling for those of a larger 
build to move through. An earthy silence looms here within the 
walls, ceiling and floor, yet any sounds created from those 
passing through here echo loudly amongst the rock. Dank, humid 
air hangs heavy here, a foul, musty odour rising up to assail the 
nostrils, the pervasive stench amplified by the lack of wind or 
breeze this deep underground.

   The confines of the dark, strong rock of this tunnel are 
hardly confining at all, this space like a bloated belly of space 
in the underwarrens of the Ephel Duath. Long stalagmites and 
stalactites force some navigation to avoid, yet in general there 
is area enough for even the largest creatures here. Distant 
echos bounce across the jagged rock walls of the tunnel, faint 
near-sounds with no shape or texture. Thousands of tiny, faintly

   The walls of this dark pit bend and twist and turn with every 
other footstep, the floor beneath and the ceiling above likewise 
rising and falling randomly as the tunnel progresses. Progress 
through this section of the warren is near-always conducted 
either up or down hill, flat ground not in sight. Hairline 
cracks that spread through the ceiling of the rock tunnel allow 
faint breaths of chill air to seep down into the warrens here, 
the cold zephyrs gentle to the extreme. Fist-sized spiders move 
slowly across the roof of the cave, the occasional one dangling

   Tight kinks and bends plague this subterranean shaft as it 
leads back dull, igneous rock. Many turns are pressed close 
together, both the ceiling and the walls compressing to form 
tight holes that require much scrabbling for those of a larger 
build to move through. The floor of the tunnel here is littered 
with loose shale and small rocks, making the footing beneath 
treacherous. Scraps of rusted iron, identifiable after a moment 
as broken blades and ancient pommels, lurk upon the ground.

   The rough, jagged walls of this burrow are set close together 
in places as hunk of sharp, black rock lurch out from the sides, 
ceiling and roof, forcing those who would travel through here to 
bunch up at certain sharp twists of the path. A thick patch of 
fungus grows here, dull toadstools rising up from numerous cracks 
and splinters in the stones that litter the floor of the tunnel. 
Thick webbing covers everything, the silky grey strands clutching 
desperately at everything they touch.

   Hacked out by some unknown agent ages past, this roughly 
circular tunnel cuts a path through the black mountains of the 
Ephel Duath, this section of the passageway high enough to 
accommodate the tallest of creatures, and is equally broad. A 
low, steady sound, like a distant thump, drifts down from 
somewhere in the darkness to roll amongst this portion of the 
subterranean shaft. A light layer of webbing has been spun 
across the rocks, the silvery-grey patterns of intricate, 
geometric designs.

   The walls of this dark pit bend and twist and turn with every 
other footstep, the floor beneath and the ceiling above likewise 
rising and falling randomly as the tunnel progresses. Progress 
through this section of the warren is near-always conducted 
either up or down hill, flat ground not in sight. An earthy 
silence looms here within the walls, ceiling and floor, yet any 
sounds created from those passing through here echo loudly 
amongst the rock. Sheets of heavy webbing stretch from the roof 
to the ground, forcing one to hack them aside to progress along 
the tunnel.

   The confines of the dark, strong rock of this tunnel are 
hardly confining at all, this space like a bloated belly of space 
in the underwarrens of the Ephel Duath. Long stalagmites and 
stalactites force some navigation to avoid, yet in general there 
is area enough for even the largest creatures here. Hairline 
cracks that spread through the ceiling of the rock tunnel allow 
faint breaths of chill air to seep down into the warrens here, 
the cold zephyrs gentle to the extreme. Large lumps covered in 
the silvery-grey webbing that is draped about the cavern hang on 
the ceiling and walls, the occasional skeletal hand poking 
through the cobweb prisons.

Distant echos bounce across the jagged rock walls of the tunnel,

webbing has been spun across the rocks, the silvery-grey patterns 
of intricate, geometric designs.

   The rough, jagged walls of this burrow are set close together 
in places as hunk of sharp, black rock lurch out from the sides, 
ceiling and roof, forcing those who would travel through here to 
bunch up at certain sharp twists of the path. This deep beneath 
the ground, the air here is most humid and warm, the stillness of 
the air that lurks amongst the black rock adding to the shallow 
breaths one is forced to take here. Scraps of rusted iron, 
identifiable after a moment as broken blades and ancient pommels, 
lurk upon the ground.

   Tight kinks and bends plague this subterranean shaft as it 
leads back dull, igneous rock. Many turns are pressed close 
together, both the ceiling and the walls compressing to form 
tight holes that require much scrabbling for those of a larger 
build to move through. Thick clouds of dust swirl in the air 
here, only the faintest of currents leaking into this portion of 
the catacombs, yet even this meager whispers of wind send the 
near-fog into occasional spins and spirals. Dark stains are 
splashed randomly across the rocks of the underwarrens, and 
whatever the substance was it is now dried and flaking.

   The confines of the dark, strong rock of this tunnel are 
hardly confining at all, this space like a bloated belly of space 
in the underwarrens of the Ephel Duath. Long stalagmites and 
stalactites force some navigation to avoid, yet in general there 
is area enough for even the largest creatures here. An aroma of 
slow rot and decay, tinged with sweetness, drifts amongst the 
black rock of the tunnel, punctuated by the occasional waft of 
fresh air drifting in from some other section of the warrens. A 
swarm of infinitesimal gnats flit about, the whisper-whine buzz 
of their tiny wings audible as they lazily swarm towards all that 
moves.

   The walls of this dark pit bend and twist and turn with every 
other footstep, the floor beneath and the ceiling above likewise 
rising and falling randomly as the tunnel progresses. Progress 
through this section of the warren is near-always conducted 
either up or down hill, flat ground not in sight. Dank, humid 
air hangs heavy here, a foul, musty odour rising up to assail the 
nostrils, the pervasive stench amplified by the lack of wind or 
breeze this deep underground. Underfoot, a sprawl of thin, 
yellowed bones lies, crunching with a quiet snicker as one moves 
through the area.

   The stench of rot and decomposition pulses from this chamber 
like a physical thing, pushing forward in warm wave after warm 
wave. The floor is littered with the bones and shriveled corpses 
of thousands of creatures. Almost all of these corpses are 
wrapped in a fine, silk-like webbing, some of which looks almost 
brittle with age. The walls and floors are smeared with a 
strange, black-red substance that looks sticky. One can imagine 
that this is some sort of vile, bloody excreta.

   The confines of the dark, strong rock of this tunnel are 
hardly confining at all, this space like a bloated belly of space 
in the underwarrens of the Ephel Duath. Long stalagmites and 
stalactites force some navigation to avoid, yet in general there 
is area enough for even the largest creatures here. Dank, humid 
air hangs heavy here, a foul, musty odour rising up to assail the 
nostrils, the pervasive stench amplified by the lack of wind or 
breeze this deep underground. Underfoot, a sprawl of thin, 
yellowed bones lies, crunching with a quiet snicker as one moves 
through the area.

   Tight kinks and bends plague this subterranean shaft as it 
leads back dull, igneous rock. Many turns are pressed close 
together, both the ceiling and the walls compressing to form 
tight holes that require much scrabbling for those of a larger 
build to move through. A low, steady sound, like a distant 
thump, drifts down from somewhere in the darkness to roll amongst 
this portion of the subterranean shaft. Small puddles of warm, 
black and foul waters pool amongst the lumps and bumps of the 
tunnel, the occasional drop falling from cracked ceiling.

   The rough, jagged walls of this burrow are set close together 
in places as hunk of sharp, black rock lurch out from the sides, 
ceiling and roof, forcing those who would travel through here to 
bunch up at certain sharp twists of the path. An earthy silence 
looms here within the walls, ceiling and floor, yet any sounds 
created from those passing through here echo loudly amongst the 
rock. The floor of the tunnel here is littered with loose shale 
and small rocks, making the footing beneath treacherous.

   The walls of this dark pit bend and twist and turn with every 
other footstep, the floor beneath and the ceiling above likewise 
rising and falling randomly as the tunnel progresses. Progress 
through this section of the warren is near-always conducted 
either up or down hill, flat ground not in sight. Hairline 
cracks that spread through the ceiling of the rock tunnel allow 
faint breaths of chill air to seep down into the warrens here, 
the cold zephyrs gentle to the extreme. Fist-sized spiders move 
slowly across the roof of the cave, the occasional one dangling 
down on a long strand of web.

   Hacked out by some unknown agent ages past, this roughly 
circular tunnel cuts a path through the black mountains of the 
Ephel Duath, this section of the passageway high enough to 
accommodate the tallest of creatures, and is equally broad. This 
deep beneath the ground, the air here is most humid and warm, the 
stillness of the air that lurks amongst the black rock adding to 
the shallow breaths one is forced to take here. Crawling madly 
over the walls and roof are any number of tiny spiders, all 
either a black, grey or sickly purple in colour.

Ephel Duath, this section of the passageway high enough to 
accommodate the tallest of creatures, and is equally broad. This 
deep beneath the ground, the air here is most humid and warm, the 
stillness of the air that lurks amongst the black rock adding to 
the shallow breaths one is forced to take here. Fist-sized 
spiders move slowly across the roof of the cave, the occasional 
one dangling down on a long strand of web.

   The rough, jagged walls of this burrow are set close together 
in places as hunk of sharp, black rock lurch out from the sides, 
ceiling and roof, forcing those who would travel through here to 
bunch up at certain sharp twists of the path. Thick clouds of 
dust swirl in the air here, only the faintest of currents leaking 
into this portion of the catacombs, yet even this meager whispers 
of wind send the near-fog into occasional spins and spirals. 
Crawling madly over the walls and roof are any number of tiny 
spiders, all either a black, grey or sickly purple in colour.

   Tight kinks and bends plague this subterranean shaft as it 
leads back dull, igneous rock. Many turns are pressed close 
together, both the ceiling and the walls compressing to form 
tight holes that require much scrabbling for those of a larger 
build to move through. Thick clouds of dust swirl in the air 
here, only the faintest of currents leaking into this portion of

mucus and thousands of bumps and marks.

   The confines of the dark, strong rock of this tunnel are 
hardly confining at all, this space like a bloated belly of space 
in the underwarrens of the Ephel Duath. Long stalagmites and 
stalactites force some navigation to avoid, yet in general there 
is area enough for even the largest creatures here. An earthy 
silence looms here within the walls, ceiling and floor, yet any 
sounds created from those passing through here echo loudly 
amongst the rock. Sheets of heavy webbing stretch from the roof 
to the ground, forcing one to hack them aside to progress along 
the tunnel.

   Silk threads cover the walls, ceiling and floor of the rounded 
chamber, which measures some forty or fifty feet across. The 
threads, which are a dirty, light-grey color, muffle sound, and 
give the chamber a quiet, almost dead feeling. Objects are 
embedded, or stuck to the threads at all locations: some stuck to 
the ceiling, others on the floor, and some awkwardly pressed to 
the walls. These rounded objects are also covered with the same 
grey-white silk. The chamber has a strong, almost acidic odor, 
which burns the nose.

fresh air drifting in from some other section of the warrens. 
Crawling madly over the walls and roof are any number of tiny 
spiders, all either a black, grey or sickly purple in colour.

   Hacked out by some unknown agent ages past, this roughly 
circular tunnel cuts a path through the black mountains of the 
Ephel Duath, this section of the passageway high enough to 
accommodate the tallest of creatures, and is equally broad. 
Dank, humid air hangs heavy here, a foul, musty odour rising up 
to assail the nostrils, the pervasive stench amplified by the 
lack of wind or breeze this deep underground. Large, 
purple-black eggs cluster to the high segments of the tunnel 
here, covered in mucus and thousands of bumps and marks.

   The rough, jagged walls of this burrow are set close together 
in places as hunk of sharp, black rock lurch out from the sides, 
ceiling and roof, forcing those who would travel through here to 
bunch up at certain sharp twists of the path. A low, steady 
sound, like a distant thump, drifts down from somewhere in the 
darkness to roll amongst this portion of the subterranean shaft. 
Large lumps covered in the silvery-grey webbing that is draped 
about the cavern hang on the ceiling and walls, the occasional 
skeletal hand poking through the cobweb prisons.

   Tight kinks and bends plague this subterranean shaft as it 
leads back dull, igneous rock. Many turns are pressed close 
together, both the ceiling and the walls compressing to form 
tight holes that require much scrabbling for those of a larger 
build to move through. An earthy silence looms here within the 
walls, ceiling and floor, yet any sounds created from those 
passing through here echo loudly amongst the rock. Mummified 
carcasses of all manner of small creatures are bound up in the 
immense sheets of webbing that covers the walls of the passage.

   The confines of the dark, strong rock of this tunnel are 
hardly confining at all, this space like a bloated belly of space 
in the underwarrens of the Ephel Duath. Long stalagmites and 
stalactites force some navigation to avoid, yet in general there 
is area enough for even the largest creatures here. Hairline 
cracks that spread through the ceiling of the rock tunnel allow 
faint breaths of chill air to seep down into the warrens here, 
the cold zephyrs gentle to the extreme. A low, steady sound, 
like a distant thump, drifts down from somewhere in the darkness

   The walls of this dark pit bend and twist and turn with every 
other footstep, the floor beneath and the ceiling above likewise 
rising and falling randomly as the tunnel progresses. Progress 
through this section of the warren is near-always conducted 
either up or down hill, flat ground not in sight. Scraps of 
rusted iron, identifiable after a moment as broken blades and 
ancient pommels, lurk upon the ground. Fist-sized spiders move 
slowly across the roof of the cave, the occasional one dangling 
down on a long strand of web.

air hangs heavy here, a foul, musty odour rising up to assail the 
nostrils, the pervasive stench amplified by the lack of wind or 
breeze this deep underground. A swarm of infinitesimal gnats 
flit about, the whisper-whine buzz of their tiny wings audible as 
they lazily swarm towards all that moves.

Through The Black Caves~
   The walls of this dark pit bend and twist and turn with every 
other footstep, the floor beneath and the ceiling above likewise 
rising and falling randomly as the tunnel progresses. Progress 
through this section of the warren is near-always conducted 
either up or down hill, flat ground not in sight. A thick patch 
of fungus grows here, dull toadstools rising up from numerous 
cracks and splinters in the stones that litter the floor of the 
tunnel. Thick clouds of dust swirl in the air here, only the 
faintest of currents leaking into this portion of the catacombs, 
yet even this meager whispers of wind send the near-fog into 
occasional spins and spirals.

Through The Black Caves~
   Tight kinks and bends plague this subterranean shaft as it 
leads back dull, igneous rock. Many turns are pressed close 
together, both the ceiling and the walls compressing to form 
tight holes that require much scrabbling for those of a larger 
build to move through. Dank, humid air hangs heavy here, a foul, 
musty odour rising up to assail the nostrils, the pervasive 
stench amplified by the lack of wind or breeze this deep 
underground. A thick patch of fungus grows here, dull toadstools 
rising up from numerous cracks and splinters in the stones that 
litter the floor of the tunnel.

rising and falling randomly as the tunnel progresses. Progress 
through this section of the warren is near-always conducted 
either up or down hill, flat ground not in sight. Hairline 
cracks that spread through the ceiling of the rock tunnel allow 
faint breaths of chill air to seep down into the warrens here, 
the cold zephyrs gentle to the extreme. Thousands of tiny, 
faintly pulsing eggs cling to the roof, occasionally dripping 
down a thick wad of pus.

   The rough, jagged walls of this burrow are set close together 
in places as hunk of sharp, black rock lurch out from the sides, 
ceiling and roof, forcing those who would travel through here to 
bunch up at certain sharp twists of the path. Dank, humid air 
hangs heavy here, a foul, musty odour rising up to assail the 
nostrils, the pervasive stench amplified by the lack of wind or 
breeze this deep underground. Distant echos bounce across the 
jagged rock walls of the tunnel, faint near-sounds with no shape 
or texture.

rising and falling randomly as the tunnel progresses. Progress 
through this section of the warren is near-always conducted 
either up or down hill, flat ground not in sight. Sheets of

hack them aside to progress along the tunnel. Large, 
purple-black eggs cluster to the high segments of the tunnel 
here, covered in mucus and thousands of bumps and marks.

Through The Black Caves~
   The confines of the dark, strong rock of this tunnel are 
hardly confining at all, this space like a bloated belly of space 
in the underwarrens of the Ephel Duath. Long stalagmites and 
stalactites force some navigation to avoid, yet in general there 
is area enough for even the largest creatures here. A low, 
steady sound, like a distant thump, drifts down from somewhere in 
the darkness to roll amongst this portion of the subterranean 
shaft. Small puddles of warm, black and foul waters pool amongst 
the lumps and bumps of the tunnel, the occasional drop falling 
from cracked ceiling.

A Sheer Mountain Face~
   The barren, unforgiving black rock of the Ephel Duath is 
none-the-less pitted and pocked in many places, allowing for a 
number of handholds to allow one up and down the sheer surface, 
the wind howling about the area here.

A Deep Ravine~
   A narrow, V-shaped ravine scrambles northeast into the 
heartless mountains which border the Morgul Vale. The ground is 
littered with sharp shards of obsidian, and black basaltic 
rubble. The ravine spills out into the broader valley of the 
Morgul Vale to the south.

Fork in a Deep Ravine~
   Blocks of red-black basalt, and shards of obsidian litter the 
bottom of this west-east running ravine. The ravine cuts through 
the black, volcanic mountains which form the impenetrable western 
bordor of Mordor. The many jagged peaks of the range tower 
overhead thousands of feet. A smaller ravine splinters off to 
the north. 
   A massive collapse of the mountainside completely obscures the 
way westwards, a trail stopping directly in front of huge 
boulders. The entire area seems unstable as if more rocks could 
topple soon.

Small Side Ravine~
   Perhaps this narrow but deep ravine drained water which fell 
upon the mountains of Ephel Duath in ages past. The gash through 
the red-brown and black rock rises and narrows to the north until 
the point that it becomes impassable, except for a small entrance 
into a dark cave.

A Deep Ravine~
   An ugly gash of basalt and obsidian slices through the 
heartless mountains which make up the Ephel Duath, the border 
mountains which defend the west flank of Mordor. Rising up like 
the sharp, black teeth of some horrible carnivorous beast, the 
many peaks which make up the range tower thousands of feet 
overhead.

   The dizzying pinnacles of volcanic stone which make up the 
Ephel Duath tower overhead, casting this deep, steep-walled 
ravine in almost constant shadow. A nearly constant wind funnels 
through the ravine to the west. The bottom of the ravine is an 
ugly jumble of basalt talus and obsidian shards.

Landslide in a Deep Ravine~
   A large landslide has filled in the east part of this deeply 
cut ravine, which slashes through the lofty and jagged peaks of 
the Ephel Duath. The slide is a large heap of huge blocks and 
boulders of blackred basalt. The ravine would seem to continue 
to the east but for the slide but that seems all but impossible 
now. 
   A slight breeze, which seems to originate from the east, stirs 
through the area. A slight whistle can be heard as the wind 
passes through the boulders.
