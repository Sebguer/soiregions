over-sized sized shaggy orange pelt fur horns rough mat rug LEATHER~
an oversized, shaggy, orange pelt with horns attached to the front~
A rough rug made out of orange, matted fur lies here, horns protruding from the end.~
   Shaggy layers of orange matted fur line this unusual pelt. It 
is quite thick and heavy, the bottom of the rough and leathery 
skin still attached to it. Nearly eight feet in length it leaves 
the question as to what sort of creature this could have come 
from. A pair of jagged horns stand out from the top of the 
beasts extending to the length of about six inches. It is easily 
imagine this animal was of comparable size with a bear at one 
time or another.

A worn-out, leather shoulder strap lies here.~
   This battered strap fits over the shoulder, and encircles the 
torso once. The leather is cracked and brittle, and shows signs 
of heavy use. A sheath, the stitching frayed, has been sewn onto 
the strap, allowing a weapon to be carried over the shoulder.

a short, but baggy black robe with an oversized cowl~
A baggy, cowled robe has been crumpled up here and lies forgotten.~
   These baggy robes were obviously intended for someone of a 
shorter stature and are punctured in many place with various 
holes. Dirt stains the coarse fabric in places and it is clear 
these robes are very lived in and used. An oversized pointy hood 
hangs from the top, it appears better designed to hide the 
occupants face then to protect the occupant from the elements.

a massive stone swordblade~
Long forgotten, a massive stone swordblade stands vertical here, partially buried.~
   Hewn of a dark-hued stone, this massive construct seems to 
have been, at one point, the swordblade of a statue. It still 
retains its general shape, though it bears the time-worn 
destruction that most of its real counterparts would only bear 
after decades of use and abuse. At least part of it remains 
buried beneath the earth; no amount of pushing, pulling, or 
digging will allow one to budge the four-foot tall, two-inch-wide 
stone creation.

Many shards of bone are scattered over the ground.~
   Scattered across the floor are shards of broken bone. They 
seem to be fairly old; there is no trace of the flesh that once 
clung to them. Most are stark white, but many are stained yellow 
and brown. The shapes of some of the more intact pieces indicate 
that the bones may have come from a human.

   The upper half of this old, yellowed skull has been smashed, 
and tiny bone fragments are lying around it. The jaw is severely 
mangled, with each end twisted in opposite directions. The flesh 
has long since rotted away, and most of the teeth are missing. A 
large crack runs through the center of what remains of the face, 
nearly splitting the skull in two.

a map-covered table of stained pine~
A stained pine table, covered in maps, dominates the center of the room.~
   Built sturdily out of old planks of pine, this functional 
table has apparently seen better days. Covered in stains of 
long-cleaned spills of beer, wine, various other drinks, and the 
occasional crimson-hued stain of questionable nature, the table 
does indeed seem to have seen more than its share of use. 
Stretching long and slightly narrow, the table seems to be more 
designed for function than for decor, as sprawled over it at any 
given time are numerous maps. Blue pins, red pins, the 
occasional black or yellow pin and all sorts of routes have been 
lain across the maps, each obviously bearing some purpose or 
another. At the head of the table rests one chair, and along 
each side rests another seven.

a crumbling, muck-encrusted stone fountain~
A muck-encrusted stone fountain, long crumbling, stands in the street.~
   Long sent into the downward spiral of decay, this stone 
fountain bears many signs of aging, and is not taking the process 
well. What could have been, at one time, a beautiful spear 
centerpiece, rising majestically from the center, is now merely a 
cracked, chipped, and worn stone shaft, the head halfway broken 
off. The rim of the foot-deep fountain is similarly cloven in 
places, and though the rim is a foot high, it only bears water 
halfway to it, as on one end, a crack nearly six inches long 
winds down from the edge of the rim. The fountain bears a thick 
layer of muck on one side, polluting the water for all but the 
most desperate. Tendrils of wet moss snake outward into the road 
from the fountain.

   Upon closer inspection, this sheath bears no weapon, and in 
fact, is not a sheath at all. It is a small pouch of well-tanned 
leather, a bladeless dagger hilt attatched just before it. Thin 
ties of material have been affixed to the pouch, allowing one to 
bind it to their wrist or arm. The pouch is very small, with 
only enough room to carry a couple small objects within.

a sharply-curved, deep-black tower shield~
A large hunk of sharply-curved black glass lies here.~
   Made of hard, thick plates of deep ebony glass, this tall 
shield curves sharply outward to both sides, forming a sharp 
outward wedge in the middle. The thick, surprisingly sturdy inky 
glass is lined with a silvery-grey metal, binding the plates 
together. Made of a similar silver metal, the center of each 
side of the wedge is etched with the White Tree of Gondor. 
Surprisingly enough, considering this shield's size and the 
materials with which it is made, it is very light. Even more 
surprising is that, from the bearer's side of the wedge, the 
glass is transparent, allowing the user to see straight through 
the shield.

an iron full-helm imbued with a roaring lion~
An iron full-helm imbued with a roaring lion lies here~
   This helm, made of high-quality iron, has been beaten and 
tempered into a fine, obviously high-class, piece of armor. The 
metal itself is thick and smooth, yet not the foremost feature of 
this particular helm. The front of the helm, when the visor is 
down, has been masterfully crafted to bear the effigy of a 
roaring, enraged lion. The creature's mouth is open as if to 
release a roar of promised combat, exquisite detail having been 
taken to render the image of broad teeth, hungry maw, and harsh 
snarl. The traditional visor has been merged brilliantly into 
the image, creating the top half of the ferocious spectacle. The 
eyes are slightly recessed, deepening into holes to provide the 
wearer with adequate sight an adeptly crafted to lend an air of 
vehemence to the helm's personality. Overall, the image of the 
lion captured mid-roar and shaped into a helm has had a fearsome 
effect on this piece of armor.

A snug leather vest, black as night, lies here.~
   This snug, quarter-sleeved leather vest is the color of 
blackest night, its surface treated with a finish that prevents 
it from reflecting light. Although it fits the wearer tightly, 
it is soft and cut so as to allow for freer movement than a 
typical piece of light armor. Straps and buckles under the arms 
allow for the adjustment of fit as well as complete removal of 
the vest. An oval-shaped, articulated patch of boiled leather, 
dyed and finished to match the rest, provides added protection 
from blows.
