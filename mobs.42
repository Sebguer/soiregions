a flirtatious, well-rounded woman~
A painted woman with dark hair and a well-rounded body is here.~
   A woman with long dark hair and a fairly light complexion, her 
body well-rounded with an ample bosom and shapely buttocks - all 
her charms normally presented in a way by her movements and poses 
that indicates that they are available, or at least that such a 
thing is negotiable. Her dark eyebrows are plucked thin, and 
enhanced to a ink-black hue. Her eyes are pale blue, and appears 
bigger and brighter from her painted eyelashes and the dark tone 
of blue on her lower eyelids. The lips are full, carrying a 
healthy red tone. Aside from some slight marks on her face, left 
by time and wear, her age is very hard to determine.

a pale-skinned hunched man~
A pale-skinned hunched man remains here.~
   The brown hair atop this man's head begins to gave way to 
large patches of grey, his wild and scraggly beard following suit 
with the same split-hue appearance. Very deep set eyebrows sit 
above his very sunken, indigo-colored eyes that peer out at the 
world wide as is trying to examine everything as much as 
possible. A slightly jaundiced tint haunts his pale, rough and 
worn skin, his small, roughly calloused hands a darker shade of 
yellow, with many small scars otherwise marring them. His arms 
are well muscled, especially in the region of his forearms, a 
feature offset from the rest of his, thin and plank-like body. 
An odd, off-putting smile often glances this man's features.

A broad man with a reddish-hued face stands here.~
   A broad reddish-hued face that is cleanly shaved and displays 
groves and lines from a hard life are flanked by small and 
pouting ears. Sand colored hair falls from the head, reaching 
down to his shoulders and sharp blue eyes peer from under bushy 
eyes and heavy eyelids. Broad and tall of shape, with 
sausage-like fingers and wide hips. While not being fat, his 
stout appearance is enhanced by a small pot-belly that extends 
above his belt.

a thin, caramel-haired young woman~
A thin, caramel-haired young woman stands here, looking about.~
   This young woman has shoulder length hair, a mix of caramel 
blonde with some light ashy brown streaks. Though her form is 
very waif-like and thin, she has faint curves and shapely limbs, 
giving her a feminine and fragile appearance. Her round face is 
dominated by oft-bitten lips, a slightly unruly set of light 
brown brows, and large clear green eyes that watches others with 
a careful curiousness. A faint, yet identifiable scent of sweet 
honey seems to permanently follows her movements.

a stout, wavy-haired man~
A stout man with wavy hair and a tanned complexion stands here.~
   This man, likely in his late twenties or early thirties has 
thick, brown and wavy hair that falls below his shoulders, held 
back from his face with a leather strap. He has chestnut eyes 
and a somewhat tanned and leathered complexion. A broad nose is 
matched by broad shoulders and a wide chest, that makes him look 
somewhat stout. His hands and arms carry frequent callouses and 
are marked with scars and missing patches of hair, long singed by 
fire. All things in combination no doubt marking him as a long 
working blacksmith. Below his throat, when visible, centered on 
his chest is an old burn-mark in the shape of a cage.

a generic miner~
A generic miner from the Moria outpost stands here.~
   A miner, and most likely either part-owner or related to a 
part-owner of the iron mine - this individual has a strong and 
independent look and as such is both marked by the wilderness and 
a hard life. Dirty and worn by hard work in the mine, this miner 
has a straight back when room allows it and a proud stance. 
These men and women are not likely to either give up, or accept 
anyone's advice over their own.

A tall and weather-worn woman stands here selling her farm produce.~
   Standing quite tall, this hardened middle-aged woman have a 
tanned and weather-worn face that is plainly shaped with few 
distinguishing features aside from the scars between her eyebrows 
just where the nose-ridge meet her forehead. The scars are very 
regular and makes her wear the similarity to an eternally frowned 
brow - they are showing very visibly in paled white against the 
tanned skin. Her brown hair is set in a braid on her back 
reaching down to her middle back, and the eyes are a cloud-grey 
hue. The body is sturdy with few feminine attributes.

An aged man with short-cropped white hair stands here with a strict posture.~
   Sharp features marked by lines cut by a life-time of carrying 
a stern outlook is prominent on the face of this thin man. Small 
scars and a nose that been broken several times give credence to 
the hard nut-brown eyes beneath a white-grey brow. The hair is 
completely white as fallen snow, and cut very short close to the 
scalp. He is of quite ordinary length for a grown man, and with 
a slightly tanned complexion.

A wild mountain lion crouches here.~
   Sleek and powerfully built, this tawny-furred beast gives an 
imposing sight. Its piercing golden eyes are large and alert, 
set above a faintly scarred nose. Sharp predator claws and 
teeths hide beneath a bewitching beauty. A sabled ruff extends 
from the back of its protruding ears, channeled down its forearms 
and briefly along its spine. Muscular limbs coil and bunch at 
even the small movement, while its tufted tail constantly 
twitches around.

with a big and sturdy physique. Dressed and acting practically, 
with simple language and habits - used to the wilderness and 
marked by sun and the elements.

   A hardy and simple breed of man with an tendency towards fair 
hair and eyes combined with a big and sturdy physique. It is 
clear that this individual come from villages and hamlets, and is 
equipped by family and their own purse rather then an organised 
army. These warriors from the northern lands have their hair 
braided and tucked inside their clothing and armour, always a 
weapon close at hand.

Readmanu Giarnath enormous kingly red furred king monarch bear~
a kingly red furred bear~
A kingly red furred bear stands here, a silent and enormous monarch.~
   Age has bleached the snout and ear tips of this massive bear 
to a reddish blond contrasting the thick shaggy fur that hangs 
from its mammoth head. Intelligent brown-black eyes peer from 
under a flat brow. A few scars, trophies of age forgotten 
battles, cannot be concealed by the thinner fur of the snout and 
crisscross around a wet black nose. Broad shoulders, covered in 
red fur, are massively muscled and stand higher and broader than 
the height of a man. Four feet capped in claws the thickness of 
three fingers each grip the earth with surprising dexterity. An 
unmistakable majesty and awareness radiate from this creature's 
gaze contrasting almost completely with the sense of elemental 
strength that permeates its body.

Alastor wight bySongweaver enigmatic figure barrow burning eyes~
an enigmatic figure with burning eyes~
An enigmatic figure given form by unnatural grey-white mist rises here, its eyes burning with a cold fire.~
   The ambiguously-shaped figure is without flesh, and yet is 
given some form by wisps of eerie grey-white mist. The figure's 
form shifts and contorts, as if blown about by some unseen wind. 
The otherwordly apparition is dreadful to behold, with eyes that 
burn with blue fire and an aura which devours any warmth around 
it. Still, there is still something faintly humanoid about its 
haunting disposition and movements.

a graceful elven male~
A graceful elven male with green-grey eyes stands here calmly.~
   Smooth blemish free skin accentuates the aquiline features of 
this tall patient being. Black hair is short cropped, falling 
just shy of the shoulders and swept behind a pair of pointed 
ears. A slight frame and long limbs lend a exaggerated unearthly 
grace and height to them. His eyes are an ageless green-grey 
under arched black eyebrows.

a stern ageless male~
A stern ageless male with powerful features stands here vigilant.~
   Slim shoulders are capped by a long neck which supports a 
strongly jawed visage. High cheekbones and a thin nose lend a 
pinched air to a face unmarked by time and maned by long silken 
black hair. This male maintains an aloof air with spartan, 
deliberate gestures. Alabaster skin accentuates grey eyes which 
look out at the world as if seeing deeply into all things.

A stern-featured old man with blonde braids stands here grimly.~
   A stern browed and strong jawed old man looks out at the world 
with a fierceness that time seems to have been unable to dim. 
His skin is pasty and looks to have been roughened by exposure to 
the elements. Two blond braids corral his hair away from his 
face and hang down his slightly bowed back. His hands are 
scarred by many small white lines and appear quite nimble.

a battle-scarred old man~
A battle-scarred old man stands here with eyes as blue as a summer sky.~
   His left arm ending at a leather cap at the wrist this blond, 
blue eyed, old man bears the marks of many battles. A perpetual 
scowl is carved out of his face by a livid white line that starts 
at the corner of his right eye and trails off to the jaw line. 
He moves about his shop with an obvious limp. Little dimmed by 
these handicaps his movements are sure, his gaze steady.

a large bull moose with gigantic antlers~
A large bull moose with gigantic antlers stands here pawing at the ground.~
   This gigantic specimen of a male moose is covered in a thick 
matte of closely grown brown hair. It's eyes are a beady-black, 
wide of its long snout and bulbous mouth. It moves with power 
and surety, its hooves leaving a clear path beneath it. Though 
the beast monstrously large, its antlers are truly impressive. 
Spanning nearly six feet wide, they look like large hands of bone 
whose fingers were frozen as they began to curl closed. Though 
each protrusion is blunted, they can still rend flesh and bone 
with ease. Its nostrils flare warily as if just itching for a 
fight.

   Standing at over seven feet at the top of her head, this shy

than a few moments before she alert to her surroundings once 
more. Her coat of hair is glossy and smooth, brown as loam and 
good earth. Strong legs and sharp hooves make for powerful 
weapons should she be cornered.

   Standing a height above most of his race, and well above 
nearly all men, this Elven male bears an air of regality. Fair, 
unmarred skin bearing a light glow stretches over his lean 
compactly-muscled form. His face is composed of subtle features 
and deep, penetrating eyes peer out like a pool of wisdom, their 
age betraying his youthful visage. Long, silky flaxen hair 
spills down the back of this Elf, reaching nearly to his waist. 
His limbs are lanky, though clearly a reserve of vigorous 
strength.

a granite-eyed, jet-black-haired man~
A tall, granite-eyed man with jet-black hair looms here.~
   Looming imperiously over most lesser men, this man bears the 
clear marks of his Dunedain heritage. Stern granite eyes peer 
out from his chiseled features, with a wisdom and age betraying 
his middle-aged appearance. He is quite stout, hardened sinew 
composing his large frame. Straight jet-black hair cascades over 
his shoulders and back, a sheen of light catching in the strands. 
His hands are broad and calloused and his composure grim.

a feral pig with circular tusks and dirt matted fur~
A feral pig with circular tusks and dirt matted fur paws at the ground here.~
   Thick of shoulder and flank, this feral pig weighs some thirty 
to forty stone. Thick brown hair is matted back against strong 
muscle by a layer of dirt and mud, which causes tufts to sticks 
out at odd angles. Its tiny beady eyes are vigilant, mirroring 
the intense snuffing noises coming from its snout. Sharp teeth 
stick out of the corner of its mouth, while its tusks have grown 
in a complete circle to reattach themselves further up the jaw. 
This creature is large and rather ill-tempered.

An enormous pebbly grey skinned lizard lolls its head around here.~
   This lizard is enormous, probably weighing over four hundred 
pounds. It has plated grey skin covering its more than ample 
muscles that is pebbly in texture near its joints. Its head is a 
wedge of uncaring grey with small black beady lifeless eyes and a 
mouth festooned with rows of razor sharp teeth at least an inch 
in length. Two miniscule nostrils delineate its nose near the 
front. It has thick legs that end in obsidian claws that grip 
the ground around it. A thick tail, at least half the length of 
the body long, swishes back and forth lazily, rarely making 
contact with the ground.

A pot-bellied man with dirty-blonde hair is here, displaying his wares.~
   This man stands at a usual height for one of his people and 
seems otherwise unremarkable. A crop of scraggly, blond hair 
falls about his pudgy and worn face. He has cloudy blue eyes 
beneath a furry, straw-colored and wrinkled brow. His thin lips 
sit above a chin diminished by the rolls of fat beneath it. 
Despite the man's healthy and bloated gut, his thinning limbs 
seem able and appear used to work.

A short skeletal figure remains here, its thick bones set broadly.~
At first sight, one would likely assume this to be just a
standing dwarven skeleton, however one would soon realize
it is animate. Thick yellowed bones form the complete skeletal
figure which creaks with each movement, some covered in traces of 
tattered, leathery skin. The eye sockets are hollow, though
the pale flicker of a glow is visible within.

a weatherbeaten man~
A weatherbeaten man offers food to the workers gathered about.~
   Treated unkindly by the toils of life, this man has reached 
middle-aged, but his features bear a rugged look as a result of 
the harshnesses experienced over his years. Unkempt and burly, 
this man is covered in hair of a brownish hue, giving him a 
somewhat unclean look.

a formless Moria warg prototype~
a formless Moria warg prototype skulks through the area.~
   An intimidating sight to behold, this warg is a ferocious foe 
as it stalks about, seeking prey. Fur matted and often caked in 
blood covers this beast. Long, jagged fangs protrude from the 
creature's mouth which often oozes a thick, foul saliva. The 
eyes of this creature are dark and beady; they take a constant 
survey of the surroundings. Underneath all of the fur, taut 
muscles lie, bulging any time their owner puts them to use.

a heavy-set, grim-looking guard~
A heavy-set, grim-looking guard appears quite irate as he stands guard over the boarding ramp to the nearby ship.~
   Of heavy-build, this guard appears quite capable and strong. 
His arms and legs are thickly muscled, his hands and fingers 
thick with years of toil. He lingers here, looking 
none-too-happy about his charge of guarding the ship nearby. Of 
sour countenance he barks gruffly at any who dare question him.

A thinly-built man with long blonde hair lingers here.~
   Thin in frame, this man makes up for his lanky appearance with 
a hidden layer of muscle that ripples beneath his skin as he 
moves. Covered in a layer of soot and almost always bearing a 
cheerful grin, he speaks loudly no matter the situation. Blonde 
hair hangs down almost over his eyes, chopped harshly but to a 
relatively even length.

a lanky, ebon-haired young man~
A lanky, ebon-haired young man stands here, his skin dusted with flour.~
   This young man seems to have just grown into his height and is 
taking the transition poorly. His movements are awkward and 
clumsy and his voice cracks occasionally when he speaks. Black 
hair brushes the back of his neck, often cascading into his eyes. 
His skin is covered with what seems a perpetual dusting of flour, 
and he leaves behind a cloud of white when he moves.

A freckled, blonde-haired woman stands here stoically.~
   This woman is rather tall and most obvious about her are her 
freckles. They cover her face, neck and shoulders and in certain 
light give her face a subtle glow. She has long blonde hair that 
hangs straight down her back. Her frame is neither skinny or 
fat, and she has semi-generous curves. Her other facial features 
are unremarkable and she carries herself with quiet confidence.

of the northmen from the far reaches beyond this place. His face 
is criss-crossed with deep scars, including one that passes from 
eyebrow to eyebrow, lending him a permanent frown. His voice is 
deep and his words carefully chosen. To those who ask, he will 
tell them his name is Bernil.

A short man, with a round-face stands here.~
   Waddling whenever he moves, this short man carries himself 
busily and with pomp. Black heavy hair is tied back off his 
round face and a slightly pug nose does nothing to improve his 
appearance. His cheeks hang from aging skin yet his dark eyes 
stare out of his puffed lids with alert alacrity. When he 
speaks, his voice is, perhaps surprisingly, deep and rich and 
filled with mirth. This man calls himself Carrick of 
Calenardhon.

a lanky-bodied fur-footed hobbit~
A lanky-bodied fur-footed hobbit hawks his wares loudly.~
   Rather tall and lanky, this Stoor halfling shows an unusual 
structure compared to the squat and rotund nature of his more 
usual kin. A wild crop of blonde-hued hair, knotted in several 
spots tops his head, similiar colored hair perched on his 
oversized, constantly bare feet. The distinct smell of fish and 
brackish water clings to him, a testament to his work as a 
fishmonger. Though is appearance is otherwise kempt, a deep 
layer of unknown grime sits under his fingernails.

Geir stocky bow-legged man HEREN_CARNATALION_STABLER OSTLER~
a stocky, bow-legged man~
A stocky, bow-legged man works with the horses here.~
   This short, stocky man has heavy sloping shoulders and a back 
bent by years of hard work. His thick brown rough-cut hair is 
threaded with silver strands, and it flops over his forehead. 
Intense blue eyes are surround by nut-brown skin, etched with 
lines which deepen when he smiles. His large square hands are 
calloused, especially across the palms, and his nails are usually 
blackened with some manner of grime. The outward bow in each of 
his legs lends him a rolling gait when he moves.

A powerful, white-speckled grey stallion stomps its hooves here.~
   This equine stands proudly on four thick, muscular legs which 
end in massive, pink-white hooves. Almost eighteen hands at the 
shoulder and heavily muscular, he is obviously bred for endurance 
and strength. His neck arches up from a powerful back and 
displays a thick mane of snowy white. Out from his face, grey 
streaked with a white-blazed snout, look a pair of liquid brown 
eyes. The stallion's coat is a dove grey in color, speckled with 
white, and his long, swishing tail is as pale as his mane.

   This man stands rather tall with visibly, sun-roughened skin 
though his hair is a very, pale flaxen in color. His eyes peer 
out from beneath bushy brows, a dark green but the rest of his 
face is grim. His body is meaty but beneath the layer of fat is 
hardened muscle.

a rope-bearded, leathery-skinned man~
#6List Thorin#5 to ask a rope-bearded, leathery-skinned man about his wares.~
   This man's hair and beard are the most prominent thing about 
him, the hair nearly furry in nature as it grows wild and unkempt 
about his head in golden strands. Only his beard is 
well-maintained, braided into a rope and tied off with a leather 
thong. What can be seen of his face is heavily-wrinkled and 
sun-tanned skin, almost leathery in texture. The rest of him is 
plain and he stands at about average height.

   This man is rather brawny in build, the whole is his body

greasy, pulled back in a myriad of braids and ties.

a massive, bristle-furred wolf~
A massive, bristle-furred wolf looks around alertly.~
   Standing even above the height of an average man's hip, this 
canine creature looks to be a fully-matured adult wolf with 
hardened, but limber muscles roiling visibly beneath his fur. 
Pale, grey eyes and a black nose make up his muzzle, the short, 
wolfish snout bearing sharp, ivory colored teeth. He is covered 
in bristly fur, black and grey in color, which covers the beast 
from head to toe. He watches his surroundings alertly and stalks 
around on well-muscled legs and wide paws tipped with 
black-flecked claws on each padded foot. Rounding out his 
appearance are a pair of short fur-coveed ears that stick 
straight up.

A peg-legged, bent old man stands here.~
   Time has not been kind to this man. His left leg is a little 
more than a stump at the knee, with a solid shaft of wood keeping 
him level. His back is bent crooked, making him hunch over 
slightly forward. His body is marred many long healed scars, all 
the more noticable by the aging of his skin. Despite his age, he 
still bares a full head of white-blond hair that lays over his 
face partially obscuring sullen blue eyes.

a burly, middle-aged man with a bent nose~
A burly, middle-aged man with a bent nose stands here.~
   Thickly-built this fair-colored man shows signs of reaching 
middle age, his shoulder length straw-colored hair silvering at 
his temples, and mixing with some streaks edging towards platinum 
blonde. A testament to some great past injury, this man's nose 
is permanently bent towards the left side of his face. His face 
is more often than not stubbled with the patchy efforts of a 
beard in a sandy hue, giving him a world-weary look next to the 
crowsfeet and furrow lines that mark his sun-leathered features. 
He stands tall and capable, his regular expression subdued.

a thin young woman with curly golden hair~
A thin young woman with curly golden hair stands here.~
   This young woman appears thin and tall, her limbs long if not 
awkward or gangly. Her often smiling face shows her wide 
pale-blue eyes, that give her the appearance of a happy yet 
fragile and easily skittered deer. The golden yellow hair that 
frames her face is very thick and wavy, the strands ending in 
spiral curls. She greats the Hall's employees with a nod.

Grit large dappled-grey mare UNIQUE_POLRIC~
a large, dappled-grey mare~
A large, dappled-grey mare stomps its hooves here.~
   To those that know horseflesh, this mare is undoubtedly of 
Graehim stock. She is a little short for her breed, standing 
perhaps a hand shorter than most. She is however, very broad and 
muscular. She has a dappled-grey coat and her eyes are an earthy 
tone. She looks like a young horse, though with at least a few 
years behind her.

a one-legged, blue-eyed man~
A one-legged, blue-eyed man leans on his crutch.~
   Once a tall man and very bow-legged, he only has one leg now, 
and it still shows signs of being bowed. He has a wide, pale red 
scar across their upper right arm, and he wears his towheaded 
hair in a pony-tail. His sky blue eyes are above a knoblike nose 
and this skin is bronze toned and is weathered. At the end of 
thin shoulders are stringily muscled arms with bony hands. His 
brawny framed body has a saggy chest and and he has put on some 
excess pounds in the past few years.

A robust, earless man stands here, ready to spar.~
   Most noticeable about this man is his lack of ears. On each 
side of his head are two scarred stumps of healed flesh. Despite 
that, his body is otherwise fit and sturdy, with soft blue eyes 
and dirty blond hair that is cut in a way to cover his missing 
ears. He stands very tall, his arms and legs giving him a far 
reach.

a variable weak moria warg~
A variable weak moria warg prowls here.~
   This warg is somewhat smaller than normal for one of its kind, 
its body lithe and fur sleek, and accordingly seems to move with 
a almost silent grace, slipping past with barely a sound. A pair 
of red-tinted eyes look out from beyond its long, narrow snout, 
and over all that it observes, its maw pulled in to a silent 
snarl of hunger more often than not.

warhorse UNIQUE_PEOTHEN Mearsilfalth black-flecked white~
a black-flecked, white warhorse~
A black-flecked, white warhorse stands here.~
   This large stallion stands at about 18 hands. He is almost 
all white, save for his head, tail and three small splotches on 
his sides. One of the splotches is directly over his chest. He 
is solidly built, and despite his height, he almost looks stocky. 
Thick tufts of soft hairs completely cover each hoof. Overall 
the horses coat is very soft, and shines heavily in the light. 
His coat does little to hide the large muscles beneath. Upon his 
silky black head, only the nose bears any white. His large brown 
eyes give a tender stare and stands in sharp contrast to his 
overall appearance.

A hefty bearded man with dark-flaxen hair watches shop here.~
   With broad shoulders and a strong jaw, this Northman seems to 
have seen his share of hard labor in his life. His wavy hair 
hangs loose down to his shoulders and is flaxen in color, though 
a darker shade. His beard seems to be well kept and is rather 
full with flecks of grey beginning to creep in to it. His eyes 
are a clear, sky blue and his hands are visibly calloused.

Tauroch stallion UNIQUE_PGALTHAND light-grey coat~
a stallion with a light-grey coat~
A stallion with a light-grey coat stands here rigidly.~
   Standing around seventeen hands tall, this massive beast of a 
stallion stands firm. A fine, wispy mane of light blond hair 
flows atop this beast's head, ending near the start of the 
creature's back. Dark black eyes are set at the side of it's 
head, giving it decent peripheral vision. Various battle scars 
mar the large barreled body of this horse, giving it a well worn 
look. Firmly muscled, this hearty creature's body sports four 
thickly built legs, where four thick, well cared for hooves ends. 
Set at the end of its body, a long brilliant tail of light blond 
hair flits to and fro.

a red-faced man with dark brown eyes~
A red-faced man with dark brown eyes is about here.~
   This relatively broad man has pale, untanned skin, which is 
usually flushed red from the blood flowing underneath. Of 
average height compared to a common man, and possessing a 
grizzled face and a head of coarse-stranded hair, this person has 
broad lips and almond-shaped brown eyes within a heavyset face. 
His arms and legs are beefy and hairy, with delicate long 
fingers. The man has one of his prominent upper teeth missing 
when he smiles, and his right ear has been pierced.

a faintly luminescent worm~
A faintly luminescent worm leaves a glowing trail of slime behind it here.~
   Faintly slick interlocking plates cover this human foot sized 
worm. Its entire body casts off a meager light that is bright 
enough to be seen, though not enough to light the surrounding 
area. There do not seem to be any eyes or appendages other than 
the slimy plates on its torso. Its underbelly has no protection 
of any sort, and is little more than a mass of jellied flesh 
coated in glowing sludge.

A regal man with impeccable grooming stands behind the counter.~
   This young man has clearly had a more sheltered life. His 
skin is nearly unblemished, his hair well-groomed, and his 
posture rigid. Deep slate-green eyes peer out from under 
short-cut locks of oiled, obsidian-black hair. His lips are thin 
and sharply angled, with a cleft chin and upturned nose. His 
hands appear well-manicured, hanging from long arms. Overall his 
body is lithe, with stout legs holding up a sinewy torso.

Vanyon wight bySongweaver UNIQUE_MORIA_TOMB_PLOT dead man towering~
a towering dead man with crimson eyes~
A towering man looms here, the dead innards of his ribcage exposed.~
   Towering in height and stature, this long dead man is donning 
ancient platemail. In truth, nearly his entire hulking form is 
covered in the rusty iron platemail, and his tattered black cape 
still bears the heraldry of the White Tree, though the image has 
long since faded into a ghostly rememberance of what it once was. 
However, the central piece in his mail suite is missing; where a 
hauberk or breastplate should be, there is only black, rotten 
flesh. Where skin should cover the placement of a heart, the 
flesh is entirely gone, leaving only a brittle ribcage exposing 
the lack of a beating heart in the dead man's chest. Beneath his 
rusty iron winged-helm, shadows seem to swirl and conceal the 
wight's face. Yet within those shadows, still do two crimson 
orbs glow bright red with an otherwordly cunning.

framing a youthful, oval face. Though she is young she stands 
tall, with long, slender arms and thin legs.

   This old man has short, neatly-trimmed hair that has been dyed 
platinum with the course of time. His back is rigidly straight, 
and he holds himself with a air of confidence befitting a man of 
power. Still, age has thinned him and marked the corners of his 
eyes with crow's feet, despite his cold features. His cheeks are 
sunken in, giving away sharp cheekbones that rest beneath the 
gentleman's clear, green eyes.

A wide-blue-eyed man with a shaggy brown goatee slouches here.~
   This middle-aged man has wide, blue eyes that seem to bulge 
out attentively from their sockets. His shoulder length hair is 
shaggy and relatively unkempt, and its brown hue can only do so 
much to hide its greasiness. Likewise, his bushy eyebrows and 
rough goatee are equally ragged in appearance. He is tall, 
though, and his body looks in peak form. However, his back and 
shoulders slouch somewhat lazily, and there is not much life left 
in the blue of his eyes.

a deep-browed, white-haired man~
A very tall, deep-browed, white-haired man is here, at the ready.~
   The man looks to be in the latter part of middle-age. He has 
long, fine white hair that settles half-way down his back, and 
his deepset eyebrows are beginning to show the fade to gray and 
white as well. He is tall for a man, though not towering. 
However, he still appears to be very hale and muscularly toned. 
His facial features are not obtrusive, with a small nose coming 
to a rounded end, fair skin that shows resistance to the wrinkles 
of age, and kind, light brown eyes encircled on their perimeter 
by a ring of golden specks of color. He holds himself with a 
noble rigidity. The only noticeable marring of his skin is an 
old, fading scar that runs diagonally from his left cheek to the 
bottom of his strong-set jawline.

a sharp-snouted, large-pawed puppy~
A sharp-snouted, large-pawed puppy is here.~
   This dog is rather big for a puppy with features equally 
large. His snout is sharply-curved at the tip, almost wolf-like 
in appearance while it's paws are splayed and wide, giving the 
puppy uncommon grace and stability when he walks for a creature 
so young. Already, his teeth are quite sharp and very white, 
contrasting sharply with the jet black fur that he bears, the 
hairs short and bristly. He looks around with alert curiousity 
and his playfulness has an almost fierce quality to it.

   Bearing themself in what passes as a proud and confident 
manner for an Orc, this individual is muscular and bears many 
scars, the sign of experience granted from previous battles. 
Possessing a discipline unseen in most of its race, this Orc's 
enlarged jaw is set straight as they gaze with narrowed eyes over 
their surroundings.

Rontag barrel-chested coarse-bearded horrifically-scarred Azumaen~
a barrel-chested, horrifically-scarred dwarf~
A barrel-chested, horrifically-scarred dwarf is here.~
   Broad through the shoulders, even for one of his race, this 
dwarf seems as though carved from a dark stone by someone with 
only a vague idea of what a dwarf should look like. His skin is 
sun-darkened and weathered, and a coal-black beard covers 
portions of his face. The beard, so wholesome over most of his 
face, is entirely missing in several patches, as though something 
had ripped it completely out. Likely due to the thick layer of 
scar tissue visible in those locations, it has never grown back. 
His eyes are a murky brown, and there is a scar that runs down 
his nose, splitting his left nostril. This scar is almost 
unnoticeable when one takes in the long, concentric slashes 
running down both sides of his face and across his forehead, as 
though pieces of his skin have been literally peeled away. Hair 
coats his chest and arms, and the backs of his stubby-fingered 
hands, but it cannot conceal more evidence of similar injuries. 
His left eye has been completely removed, its socket lying in the 
center of one of the disfiguring marks on his face. His 
musculature is thick, giving him almost the appearance of a squat 
rectangle.

A brown-haired man with a rat-like face tends to the shop.~
   With features that somewhat give the idea of a rodent, with 
beady, deep-black eyes and a sharpened nose, this man is somewhat 
fidgety, moving constantly. Thin from his built, rather than 
malnourishment, the limbs of this man are still able to exert 
strenght if required. A spark of his eyes and a somewhat sly 
appearance indicate one able to haggle and barter with joy and 
skill.

a tall, hardy, very pale young man~
A tall, hardy, very pale young man with piercing blue eyes stands here.~
   This tall, muscular young man's most predominant feature is 
his piercing, soulful, pale blue eyes. They rest lightly beneath 
a set of thick, dark crimson eyebrows. His bouncy, curly 
blood-red hair rests easily at his shoulders. His jawline is 
strong and well defined, and his other facial features are sharp 
and quite symmetrical. His broad chest hints at a powerful 
build, to be complemented by the youthful vigor of his energetic, 
big, blue eyes. The calluses on his hands suggest that he has 
spent a lot of time outdoors, or part of extensive physical 
labor. His thighs are thick, solid muscle. His face and visible 
skin are very pale. Still, within his eyes is the sort of 
thoughtfulness, youth, and life found in the sort of man who is 
both reflective and passionate.

a hawk-faced, stalwart man~
A hawk-faced, stalwart man tends the stall here.~
   This man stands tall and broad-shouldered, a shock of 
platinum-blond hair growing to medium-length, often tied by a 
simple, leather cord at the base of his neck. His eyes are a 
pale green in color framed by lashes as light as the locks upon 
his head. His jawline is strong and chiseled, a small amount of 
stubble perpetually covering the lower half of his hawk-like 
face. The rest of his body is thickly-corded with muscle beneath 
skin stretched taut and amply-tanned from obvious countless hours 
under the sun and his movements are smooth and sure.

Aeranrie mottled-brown-coated young stallion pofMeeriya~
a mottled-brown-coated young stallion~
A stallion with a splash of mottled brown on his quarters is here.~
   Measuring roughly sixteen hands to the withers, this 
thick-necked young stallion is crowned with a thick mane of ebon. 
His hindquarters are dappled with a sprinkle of mixture of light 
and dark brown, while the rest of his groomed, although slightly 
fluffy coat is in its majority a dark bay. Reaching well past 
his strong muzzle, his forelock is shaggy and soft, its wisps 
often curtaining a pair of dark brown eyes. His sleek ears are 
expressive in their movements - perking and twitching rather 
often. Long-legged and a bit lanky, the stature of this steed 
suggests he still has a bit to grow in girth.

Meldirthalion grey white charger noble bearing heren_carnatalion~
a grey-and-white charger of noble bearing~
A grey-and-white charger of noble bearing stands here.~
   A coat of sooty-grey and snow-white covers the stalwart form 
of this thickly-muscled stallion, which boasts a height of 
eighteen hands. The great stature of the steed is made only more 
imposing by the bulk of his body, riddled with thickly-corded 
musculature. Robust legs are flanked by a dusting of white 
fetlocks which barely conceal immense hooves, almost twice the 
size of that found upon smaller horses. His coat is fine-haired 
and glossy, denoting a well groomed lifestyle despite the array 
of scars which criss-cross over his powerful chest and neck, 
which is often shadowed by the draping of a lengthy, misty-grey 
mane. His muzzle is pitch black, which fades into softer tones 
higher along his head. His dark brown eyes are deep in the 
sockets, which lends them an almost expressive air.

a midnight-black-coated pure-bred stallion~
A midnight-black-coated stallion of pure breed stands here.~
   Dark as midnight, not a speck of white disrupts the shadowy 
flow of this staunch stallion's sleek coat. With his obsidian 
mane cropped to an inch in length, the high-arch of his neck is 
left to display the ripple of fine muscle on movement. He yields 
a height of seventeen and a half hands, the power that his form 
might possess visible in the shape of his well-defined quarters 
and long legs. Despite his mane being shorn down, his tail is 
left untouched and free to grow, with the tips coming quite close 
to touching the earth. A slight inwards slope of his chiseled 
muzzle leads to a pair of flaring nostrils, with the dark of his 
eyes almost lost over the colour of the coat surrounding it.

A powerful, black-coated destrier stands here.~
   This powerful horse stands high above a crowd, though his 
limbs are comparatively short and strong. He has a long, arched 
neck and is well-chiseled, and short-eared. His sloping 
shoulders look quite powerful. The compact, muscular body has 
strong sloping hindquarters and a low-set tail. His tail, his 
long, thick mane, the silky hair, called feathers around his 
legs, and the rest of his coat are of a pitch-black hue.

a fleshy, hawk-nosed man~
A fleshy, hawk-nosed man stands here alertly.~
   This man stands quite tall with broad shoulders and a rather 
fleshy musculature. His body is covered with powerfully-corded 
muscle beneath a meaty layer of fat and despite his thick-girthed 
appearance, he moves with a predatory grace. His jet-black hair 
has been left long, hanging shaggily to brush past the rounding 
of the tops of his ears and often falling into his line of vision 
into his grey, green-flecked eyes. He seems to be of mixed 
heritage, bearing the grand stature of someone with purer blood, 
even his hawk-shaped nose noble in shape though the rest of his 
facial features are more common. Heavy calluses cover the palms 
of his hands and he is obviously one accustomed to hard labor or 
battle.

a compact, sanguine-haired young man~
A compact, sanguine-haired young man stands here alertly.~
   This young man stands at average height with a softly-rounded, 
kind face. His right sea green eye peer out from beneath 
perfectly-sculpted brows matching in color as the deep sanguine 
of the hair that has been neatly-groomed and cut short. Where 
the left eye would have been an empty eyesocket stand out in his 
otherwise so handsome features, an obvious tribute to war. His 
musculature is even and well-toned throughout his whole body but 
not overly taut. Despite his obviously young age, he seems 
comfortable in his own body and his steps are agile, almost cat- 
like in nature.

a sleek, black-furred hound with a ragged ear~
A sleek, black-furred hound with a ragged ear lingers here.~
   The shoulders of this young, wolf-like hound reaches the 
height of a grown man's knee. Lean and muscled, the thick, black 
coat of fur that covers its sleek form ripple with each step the 
dog takes. Its maw looks wide, filled with large canines and 
almost always hanging open. With light blue, attentive eyes 
peering out at the world, the hound looks well fed and full of 
energy. Its left ear is ragged and scarred pink, void of any 
fur. Clearly this is a young hound, young and ferocious as it 
bares ivory teeth at any getting to close.

a proud-featured, brawny man with a gray beard~
A proud-featured, brawny man with a gray beard stands here.~
   Standing a span above the average height for a human, this 
adult man carries himself in a firm, dignified manner. His frame 
is large and strong, suggesting a brawny toughness. His skin is 
fair and drawn taut over his flesh, not overly marred by scars or 
blemishes. Short-cropped hair of a pale-blond. almost greying 
crowns his scalp, cut above his ears and hinting at an early 
retreat by his receding hairline and temples. His facial 
features are angular, sharply defined and distinguished, almost 
regal in the contour of his bones. A cleanly-trimmed beard of 
gray hair clings to his pointed chin. Honed blue eyes flank his 
plain, slender nose and his eye-sockets and cheeks are somewhat 
sunken, giving him an appearance somewhat older than what his 
physique would otherwise suggest.

A strapping young man with a blond beard stands here.~
   Before you, is a phyisically imposing man, with wide shoulders 
and a clean, well-presented visage. He sports a groomed blond 
beard, which is neatly trimmed, and it covers his jaw to his 
mouth. Statuesqe and young, his body bears all the fruit of 
youth. Strong, clean-limbed and tall, with long arms ending in 
strong, yet un-scarred hands. He is pale, and has a pair of fair 
blue eyes, which sit deeply under a prominent, sandy brow. Above 
that, his thick looking forehead is shaded by a curtain of blond, 
straight hair, which falls to his collar.

A plump, round-featured man with a large bald patch is here.~
   Nothing impressive in height, this plump man stands with a 
unique, but proud posture. The crown of his head is bald, the 
effects of a receding hairline long in the process. His face is 
softly rounded, the skin of his cheeks having taken on a rosy 
blemish. A keen pair of sky blue eyes are set on either side of 
his aquiline nose, perceiving the world around him with all 
curiousness. His build is perhaps a little excessive for his 
height - his belly overhangs.

A short, wild-haired older man with curious brown eyes hunches here.~
   This slightly hunched old man possess a wild mop of unruly, 
grey-white hair. Below it is an expansive forehead, lined with 
wrinkles. His eyes are very wide, and a pleasant shade of brown. 
At the corners are crow's feet, and also around his expressive 
mouth. A thin, pencil-like neck supports his skull, and leads 
down to thin, almost always bent shoulders. His hands are brown 
and strong, and appear hardened from some sort of work, although 
they do appear to be quite nimble.

A slender-framed woman with flaxen hair stands here demurely.~
   This woman is past her younger years but it is obvious that 
time has only matured her beauty. Locks of flaxen hair fall in 
waves to the middle of her back while softer tendrils caress her 
face, framing its heart-like shape. Her eyes are an enigmatic 
shade of green, golden colour flecked around the iris and her 
skin is unnaturally creamy and pale. Despite her slender frame, 
she has a layer of toned muscle beneath feminine padding that 
accentuates the curves of her hips as well as her shapely thighs 
and calves that suggest that she once lived a life of labor 
though now, her hands are smooth and groomed.

Minstrel Lukas lanky strawberry blond~

a lanky, strawberry-blond man with horrific scarring is here~
   Young, and vibrant, this man is the picture of youth. His 
skin is smooth and healthy, his body appearing toned and firm. 
Cascading from his head and to his shoulders is a finely-groomed 
swathe of strawberry-blond hair. His eyes are slightly oval 
shaped, expressive and a deep blue. Facial hair, matching the 
color of his hair, is thin but quite noticable, due to his pale, 
milky-complexion. Wide, rigid shoulders taper down to a thin 
waist, and his legs are long and well-toned. Across his face, 
from his left earlobe up to the bridge of his nose, and then down 
to his right earlobe, are jagged, cruel looking scars. It 
appears as if some five-bladed, or clawed weapon has been dragged 
down both sides of his face, causing terrible damage.

CaedmonsonNPC rangy top-knotted man tall blond caedmon caed~
a rangy, top-knotted man~
A tall man with a blond top-knot stands here.~
   A fairly tall man stands before you, tall for his people. 
Dirty-blond hair, with many streaks of grey, sprouts from the top 
of his head, falling down to a little past his shoulders in 
length. Some of his thick hair is most often tied up into a 
large topknot while some of the bangs that fall across his face 
have been turned into thin braids. His eyes are the deepest blue 
and beneath them rest a solid, although crooked nose. With a 
high forehead, strong jawline and broad chin the man looks almost 
as if chiseled out of rock. His lips are thin and his cheekbones 
high, his head resting on a thick neck which in turn becomes 
strong shoulders and long arms. He looks physically fit, strong 
legs, broad chest, powerful hands and with the rough, tanned skin 
of an outdoorsman.

a large, black raven~
A large raven with glossy, black feathers is perched here.~
   A mass of glossy, black feathers cover this large raven. His 
beak is impressive to say the least, strong and as black as his 
beady eyes. Several puffy feathers stand up around his head as 
if to create a thick mane. Black claws are gripping at whatever 
surface this regal bird is perched upon. There's a glimmer in 
his black eyes which somehow makes it seem as if this bird is 
finding something, amusing.

A fluffy, tortoiseshell kitten frolics nearby~
   Seeming more a puff of long, black and orange fur than 
anything this kitten sports misty green eyes, a pinkish nose and 
very long whiskers. His fur is largely black though it has 
splatters of orange upon it's face and paws and it has a long 
tail that curls around behind him. He looks rather well fed, 
with a slight bulge to its belly and a small roll of baby fat 
here and there.

A bristly-bearded, hefty man stands here selling leather goods and furs.~
   A thick, bristly beard of dark brown hair frames this mans 
face, covering all but weathered lips from the nose down. His 
softly-hued blue eyes are set with crows feet and his skin is 
windburnt. Overall his frame is heavy, though he doesn't look 
entirely unfit, with thick arms and legs. An strong, pungent 
smell lingers on his person at all times.

a fat, grey-bearded man~
A fat, grey-bearded man stands here calling out prices for wood.~
   A thick, great big bushy, grey beard covers this man's chubby 
face. His head is bald and judging by the many wrinkles around 
his blue eyes, it would seem as if he's lived a long life. He 
has broad shoulders and quite the girth around both chest and 
belly. Thick arms extend into enormous hands, with which he 
directs people stacking logs of lumber.

an alert, bright-eyed female elf~
An alert, bright-eyed female elf keeps attentive watch here.~
   Possessed of a quietly inquisitive air, this female elf's 
mahogany eyes are bright and observant, drinking in all that they 
see. Her hair, a darker shade of ebony, falls in ringlets but is 
cut in a short fashion, falling just below her jawline. Bowed 
lips, with a pronounced tear drop upon the top lip, soften the 
boldness of her slightly curved nose, giving her face a disarming 
sense of strength and gentleness both. Athletically built, her 
carriage speaks of grace and a readiness for motion, her limbs 
long and supple, well proportioned to the rest of her body.

A very tall, thin man stands here with shaggy hair.~
   This man stands quite tall, at least a head or two above the 
average man. His hair is nearly platinum blond in color, 
lightened from many hours in the sun that have also left his skin 
rather deeply-tanned. His hair is rather unkempt and shaggy, 
often falling forward into his eyes and there are weathered 
calluses upon his palms and fingers, evidence of a life of labor.

An elderly woman with long, braided hair shows off her wares.~
   This woman is quite past her prime, her back stooped with age 
and her features a mask of fine wrinkles. Her blonde and white 
hair is quite long, having been braided down into a long tail 
down her back though brittle strands pull free at odd places 
along her face, sometimes making her look rather haggard. 
Despite her obvious age, she calls out market prices with vigor.

Munansarig wyrm dreadful black scales ruby~
a dreadful wyrm with black scales and ruby eyes~
A very, very long black-scaled wyrm with ruby eyes slithers here.~
   This terrible wyrm resembles a giant snake in shape and 
posture. Its skin is covered in plates of ebon scales that give 
it a sleek, but tough armor. Its coiling body is long - perhaps 
as long as thirty feet in length, if only three feet in diameter 
for much of its form. The foul creature's head is akin to a 
large reptile's, and its nostrils are oversized and flare 
rhythmically. Unlike a serpent, the wyrm's back is ridged, the 
peaks of those ridges sharp - though not nearly as sharp as its 
fangs. Only partially hidden behind scarred lips, its teeth are 
stained a yellowish-brown, and scraps of some sort of flesh are 
caught between a few of them. Its underbelly is thick and 
scaled, though smoother and perhaps a little softer than the rest 
of the beast's natural armor. Two ruby slits for eyes seem to 
glow faintly while they pierce their surroundings with a 
malicious purpose. It carries a rotten, ancient odor into the 
air surrounding it, though the most foul stench rolls out of its 
dreadful maw with its uncomfortably hot breath.

Unrik short bald-headed man green eyes ARANIN_SERGEANT~
a short, bald-headed man~
A short, bald-headed man with green eyes lingers here.~
   This man is short and stout, head completely shaven. Piercing 
green eyes peer out from beneath a pair of thin, black eyebrows. 
A strong, round nose sits in the middle of his face and beneath a 
pair of thin lips. The right part of his upper lip is raised 
slightly in a constant snarl due to a rather ugly scar that goes 
from his scalp all the way down to his lip. Due to the lack of 
hair, the many scars on his face and his weathered face it is 
hard to appreciate this mans age but he must have passed thirty 
some years ago. He walks with a wide gait, almost rolling, as if 
he's more used to sitting in the saddle then being on hard 
ground.

a gangly, black-haired man~
A gangly man with long, black hair stands here.~
   Tall and gangly, this man looms over most of his peers. He 
has long, raven-black hair hanging far past his shoulders. Dusky 
brown eyes look out at the world from beneath a pair of thick, 
black eyebrows. Above a pair of full lips rest a solid, 
protruding nose. A few small scars dot his neck and weathered 
face, indicating he is far more used to the rough outdoors then 
the comfortable shelter of the city. His long legs are wide 
apart, causing him to walk with a rolling gait as if the man is 
more used to a saddle then ground.

a large, pitch-black warg~
A large warg with pitch-black fur slips through the wilderness.~
   This warg looks to be a bit larger then many of its brethren. 
With thick, black fur and an agile, sleek form there is little 
doubt it is a formidable foe. Intelligence shines through its 
crimson-red eyes, froth and saliva seems to be constantly 
dripping from its massive jaws. It moves with the predatory step 
of a beast on hunt, silent and precise, ready to spring at any 
moment.

a variable weak moria warg~
A variable weak moria warg prowls here.~
   This warg is somewhat smaller than normal for one of its kind, 
its body lithe and fur sleek, and accordingly seems to move with 
a almost silent grace, slipping past with barely a sound. A pair 
of red-tinted eyes look out from beyond its long, narrow snout, 
and over all that it observes, its maw pulled in to a silent 
snarl of hunger more often than not.

A blonde, strapping lad stands here with a rogue's twinkle in his eyes.~
   This lad still has the round cheeks that make his youth 
evident. With long and unruly, straw-coloured hair, he stands 
shorter than most men. Yet, his form is lithe and his muscles 
seem well developed for his age. His deep blue eyes twinkle 
rogueishly, and there is a certain amount of street savvy to his 
appearance. His fair skin is unmarked by scar or blemish, and he 
caries the boyish posture of carefree energy without worry.

a shaggy-haired mountain pony~
A shaggy-haired mountain pony stands here patiently.~
   This sturdy little stallion pony stands at about thirteen 
hands in height. A medium length neck leads to his lean head 
which is refined and expressive. Large, black noble eyes are 
positioned to look forwards, echoing the large nostrils that 
adorn the end of his muzzle. A white blaze comes from the back 
of his head to end at his nose. His dark brown coat is long and 
shaggy, mixing with his short-cropped black mane into a lion-like 
appearance. He has a well shaped mid-section and croup, not too 
short or too steep. He is well muscled with unmistakable 
masculine features. Clean limbs and well formed, clearly defined 
joints lead down to his furry forlocks and sturdy hooves.

Meridol towheaded blue green shaggy boy UNIQUE_AEOLA byFrigga~
a shaggy towheaded blue-green eyed boy~
A shaggy towheaded blue-green eyed boy stands here.~
   Of average size for a male Eotheod child, this towheaded young 
boy's head is covered in shaggy, pale blonde hair, uneven and 
slightly unkempt. His eye color sits comfortably somewhere 
between blue and green, its hue favoring one or the other 
depending on the light. His slightly tanned sinewy arms and legs 
show several scrapes and small scars typical of a boy his age. A 
handful of freckles dot his face, and when he smiles his 
partially gapped front teeth show.

a haggard, but wisened old chap~
A haggard, but wisened old chap fondly tends to his duties here.~
   Twinkling almond eyes greet those who look upon this haggard 
looking man. He appears old, perhaps in his late forties. The 
mark of a life spent outdoors lays heavily upon him, as his skin 
is leathery and tanned a ruddy brown. Work-worn, gnarled hands 
peform work skillfully, oft shaking due to some illness.

A hook-nosed, pony-tailed caravan master shouts out orders to various merchants, trying to maintain some organization in the center of the busy yard.~
Tall, and gangly, this man stands slouched, with his head normally tilted back slightly. His face is long, and he has a hook-shaped nose on his face. His skin is browned by the elements, and appears somewhat greasy. His hair is worn in a long pony tail, which hangs down his back.

a grotesque, giant black bat with glowing blue eyes~
A ghoulish bat-like monster with glowing blue eyes flies above the ground.~
   This black, leathery-winged bat is unusually large in size for 
one of its species and its appearance is especially hideous. Its 
body is covered in short, coarse black fur. Its nose is squashed 
in, resembling an orc's, and large, balefully glowing red eyes 
peer out from beneath overlarge, tufted ears atop its head. Its 
mouth is filled with many sharp teeth, particularly two prominent 
canines either side of its jaw. It's wing-span is great, and its 
wing-tips are all barbed. On its feet are long, wickedly sharp 
talons.

An obsidian-colored, black-maned young stallion shifts his tail here.~
   Standing around eighteen hands high, this well-bred horse 
maintains a proud and dignified bearing, its muscled form with 
feathered-forelock and thick hooves obviously designed for 
warfare not the plow. Shiny, black intelligent eyes look about 
its surroundings, though loud noise of sudden movement of rider 
does little to displace the attention of this well-trained beast. 
A shiny, full mane and tail, and a soft coat of well-brushed skin 
give the powerful form of this animal a graceful air.

A floppy-eared, golden-haired hound is here, wagging its tail.~
   This golden-furred hound is just about as high as to a man's 
knee. Floppy ears sit on either side of his head, and waking 
eyes look out over a fairly short muzzle. Thick, curly golden 
hair covers its body, with darker patches scattered here and 
there, denoting its mixed heritage. It is likely a mix between 
Northern Breycoat and some smaller breed.

   Fiery red curls descend down to the center of her back, left 
hanging with the freedom to bounce and sway as her body movements 
dictate. Pale blue eyes stand out, cast in sharp contrast 
against her hair and fair skin, set above thin, wide lips. Her 
chest juts out in busty fashion, standing as a point of notice as 
her body curves in bell-shaped manner, her limbs thin and lithe.

   Narrow, hard, grey eyes peer out from beneath thick eyebrows, 
tufts of sand blonde hair framing the features of this

show upon his cleft-chin. His limbs are stout and thick, 
vascular with muscular tension, several noticeable and jagged 
scars visible upon his hands.

a large, ebbing mass of jet-black crows~
An ever-shifting mass of black crows maneuvers against the backdrop of night.~
   Swinging in sudden drops and steep turns, this mass of black 
avians is set dark against the night sky. Foul, painful shrieks 
emanate from within their ranks like a symphony of death, ominous 
and eerie in their organized melodies as each horrible note seems 
to exact some sort of coordinated movement. Beady, glowing red 
eyes shimmer and cast a luminescent glow about their features, 
the result being an almost dizzying display of ever-maneuvering 
aerial acrobatics caught in the midst of something far more 
sinister.

a grizzled, one-eyed dwarf with a dark umber beard~
A grizzled, umber-bearded, one-eyed dwarf loiters here, a twinkle in his eye.~
   Nearly as wide as he is tall, this brick of a dwarf is carved 
as if from the mountains themselves. Little body fat, if any, 
covers his solid form showing bluish veins in sinuous paths about 
his forearms and throat. His neck, if you can call it one, seems 
to be almost lacking entirely like a bull's. His squarish head 
bears a long, umber beard with a handful of white streaks here 
and there that is most often tucked into his belt or behind his 
head. A large, crooked nose sticks out from the center of his 
face. Despite his monstrously large physique, he bares a kind, 
blue eye that has little hardness to it. His other is missing, a 
deep jagged scar showing evidence of how it could have been lost.

Balidon grizzled stiff backed man ELITE_HEREN_CARNATALION~
a grizzled, stiff-backed man~
A grizzled, stiff-backed man stands rigidly, with a grim look on his face.~
   This grizzled-looking man has broad, square shoulders. His 
close-cropped black hair lies against his tanned scalp, the light 
brown skin rough underneath his short bristly beard. His hands 
are strong and thick, fingers flexing powerfully while he regards 
the world with light chocolate eyes. The man is a barrel-chested 
fighter, with a tall straight-backed frame, and a small gut that 
hangs a bit away from his hips.

Tap dwarf grizzled one-eyed dark umber beard POFKEGREN~
a grizzled, one-eyed dwarf with a dark umber beard~
A grizzled, umber-bearded, one-eyed dwarf loiters here, a twinkle in his eye.~
   Nearly as wide as he is tall, this brick of a dwarf is carved 
as if from the mountains themselves. Little body fat, if any, 
covers his solid form showing bluish veins in sinuous paths about 
his forearms and throat. His neck, if you can call it one, seems 
to be almost lacking entirely like a bull's. His squarish head 
bears a long, umber beard with a handful of white streaks here 
and there that is most often tucked into his belt or behind his 
head. A large, crooked nose sticks out from the center of his 
face. Despite his monstrously large physique, he bares a kind, 
blue eye that has little hardness to it. His other is missing, a 
deep jagged scar showing evidence of how it could have been lost.

A tall, morose-featured man with black hair is here.~
   Streaks of gray intermingle within long, overlapping thick 
strands of inky black hair which part to either side of this 
man's ovular, pale face, a weak chin set back and within 
accompanied by a small dimple. His eyes are a dark shade of 
green, eager red veins spider-webbing their way to the deepest 
corners. His nose is cracked in several places, a thick lump in 
the center speaking of a violent past. Thin limbs hang from his 
lithe form, small nicks and scars visible upon his hands.

A sandy-blonde, blue-eyed boy is here.~
   Bright blue eyes hold themselves centrally upon this boy's 
features, a long, straight nose jutting out beneath and leading 
towards thin lips atop of which are the very faintest beginnings 
of facial hair. His skin is darkly tanned, coupled rightly with 
the thick calluses framing his hands and joints. Gangly and 
without much meat to it, his form is lanky and indicative of the 
first signs of beginning to fill out.

A thin girl with blue-eyes and sandy-blonde hair is here.~
   Thin strands of long, sandy-blonde hair frame this young girls 
emaciated features, her cheekbones high and jutting out as her 
cheeks themselves seem unusually drawn in. Her eyes are a pale 
blue, the lids acting as their barrier carrying the weight of 
heavy, blue'ish grey bags hanging beneath. Overly thin arms and 
limbs extend out from her already extremely thin figure, her 
hands thickly calloused.

A well muscled chestnut-brown and black graehim is here.~
   Standing at eighteen hands in height, this horse is a proud 
specimen of its kind. Well muscled and powerful shoulders lead 
to a sturdy flanks and well muscled hind legs. Its coat is a 
rich chestnut-brown, the hair getting darker and darker turning 
to rich black hair along the horse's stomach. The black hair 
repeats itself along the horse's knees and its mane is flecked 
between the two colors. Its lower legs, especially around its 
hooves, are a dark white, while a stark white patch of hair runs 
down its muzzle in a lightening bolt like fashion.

A sharp-blue eyed, mahogany-haired woman stands here, smelling of spices.~
   This tall, honey skinned woman has a decidedly exotic look to 
her features. Long and sleek, her dark mahogany hair hangs 
towards her lower back, cut blunt across her forehead in bangs 
that more often cover her kohl-rimmed, almond-shaped eyes, the 
left orb a shockingly sharp blue, while the right has faded to 
faint milky-white, with High cheek-bones and a small nose 
completing her appearance. An atmosphere of perfume and spice 
clings to this woman constantly, scenting the air as she moves 
easily with a cat-like grace. When she laughs or smiles, her 
thin lips part showing straight, but faintly stained teeth.

A small brown and white bird sits near the bar on a wooden perch.~
   This small brown bird has beady black eyes, large compared to 
its small head and body. Its short rounded beak inticates it as 
a seed eating bird, its small body, barely more than six inches 
long is covered in brown, woodsy colored feathers tipped in 
white. The soft underbelly of the bird is a lighter, ruffled 
offwhite color in contrast to its spindly dark black legs. This 
bird often chirps and whorbles, its small head turning.

A muddy-haired widow-peaked man stands here, hawking his wares.~
   An unruly crop of muddy brown hair sprout from this man's 
head, little thought given to its cut or care, a prominant 
widows-peak dominating his forehead. Examining him closely, the 
scars of many small nicks and cuts cover his hands, far too small 
to be from war wounds. Hazel eyes stare out from his face from 
behind his spectacles, though they don't seem a total assistance, 
often still squinting to look at customers and wares.

a very tall man with raven hair and sharp features~
A man with raven hair looms here, his smoky eyes beset by sharp features.~
   From behind a face marked by sharp, pronounced features, a set 
of calm and smoky-grey eyes mark the most striking thing about 
this man's appearance: his face. His raven hair is slightly 
untamed, but still short and cropped. His thick, masculine 
eyebrows frame above the intense grey of his seeing orbs, and 
high cheekbones do the same beneath them. His lips are full, 
ears are small and symmetrical, and his nose is sharp and more 
elongated than the average man's; yet none of his features seem 
to be too contrasting with his size or stature. He is very tall 
for a man, and a practiced straightness holds firm his spine. 
His shoulders are level, hands are only slightly calloused, and 
the rest of his form is shelled tightly with wiry muscle and 
quite slender.

a very long, olive-and-brown cave-snake~
Perhaps ten feet long, this olive-and-brown snake rattles and slithers here.~
   This long cave-snake has scales of yellowish-brown to olive 
color. The top of the head and neck are an earthy unicolor. The 
markings on the back consist of two pairs of black rounded spots, 
which join together. From each eye there is a dark stripe, which 
extends to the corners of the mouth. The upper labials are 
yellowish-white. The snake's head is rather large, and its tail 
is perhaps ten feet long uncoiled and as thick in diameter as a 
fist.

cave_snake_3 huge brown rattle~
a huge, brown cave-snake~
With thick scales and very, very long body, this huge snake slithers here.~
   This hulking cave-snake has thick scales of mostly an earthy 
brown color. The top of the head and neck are an even darker 
shade of brown, and are unicolor. The markings on the back 
consist of two pairs of black rounded spots, which join together. 
From each eye there is a black stripe, which extends to the 
corners of the mouth. The upper labials are olive and white. 
The snake's head is very large for its race, and its tail is over 
a dozen feet uncoiled and as thick in diameter as a pair of meaty 
fists.

Denin sharp muzzled hound pofbiggins~
a sharp-muzzled hound~
A sharp-muzzled hound is about, eyes and ears on constant alert.~
   This hound stands about three feet off of the ground, trim and 
sinewy legs holding itself with an almost effortless ease. A dim 
black coat, naturally short clings to soft flesh - the contour of 
it's entire musculature appearing streamlined and sleek. A sharp 
muzzle protrudes from a thin, defined face - alert eyes set on 
either side, imprisoned in sunken sockets.

Janmarmundnpc olive skinned man silvertongue rethben~
an unkempt, olive-skinned man~
An unkempt, olive-skinned man lingers here.~
   Standing at a substantial height this olive skinned individual 
carries himself with an air of causality, his languid swagger 
ever present. An angular, tanned visage bears heavy-lidded eyes 
of a subtle grey and a short, tousled beard that frames his 
narrow chin. A disarranged mane of dark hair hangs down to the 
nape of his neck, unruly and uncared for. This mans body has 
been composed of long, lean limbs and a flat torso, giving him a 
particularly lanky appearance. Along the length of his right 
forearm is an intricate tattoo of a constellation of stars, the 
flesh inked in swirling pitch black and interrupted by 
silvery-grey specks of varying sizes; around his fingers the 
stars change to represent silver coins, winding between the 
appendages.

a beefy, wispy-haired man~
A beefy, wispy-haired man lingers here.~
   This beefy fellow is heavyset with a considerable paunch. Ham 
like fists hang down on the ends of meaty arms. His face is a 
battered affair with pea-green eyes framing his mashed nose. 
Under the bulbous, potato like nose are a pair of puffy, chapped 
lips which reveal buttery colored stumps of teeth when parted. 
Long, tangled wisps of silver hair frame the bald, leathery skin 
of his head's crown, which hangs down past his cauliflowered ears 
and to his mid-back.

A strapping, well-groomed lad stands here, sporting a cheerful grin.~
   Tall and athletic, this young man has a neatly trimmed beard 
and mustache that match the curly, blond hair atop of his head 
which is pulled back into a short ponytail. With a scar cutting 
across his face from his right temple to the corner of his full 
lipped mouth that adds more character than menace, the comely

straight nose and bright blue eyes underneath thick lashes and 
thin brows.

Snow-troll-boss UNIQUE_PLOT immense furred abomination byKodiak~
an immense, black and gray furred abomination~
An immense, black and gray furred abomination stands imposingly here.~
   Streaks of black and gray stripe this beasts fur in curving 
sweeps all along its length, matted and crusted with all manner 
of foulness ranging from bits of rotting meat crawling with small 
insects to hardened mucus catching patches of fur in horrendous 
twisting. Its left eye pulses in a hazy, dark blue while its 
right holds the constant fire of blood-red, both set deep within 
dominantly boned pits. Its frame is supported by limbs which 
give it the appearance of massive proportion, twenty feet skyward 
at the very least, likely seeming more due to its intimidating 
frame which is not undone by its thick layering of fur. It's 
nostrils seem to recede back within its fur, though obviously not 
enough that a sharpened bone could not be shoved through the 
cartilage between as one has been, it's stark white darkened by a 
splattering of aged black blood.

a small, donkey-drawn cart~
A small, wooden, two-wheeled cart is here, hitched to a donkey.~
   This small cart appears barely large enough to hold more than 
a single occupant or two. Obviously designed to carry cargo 
rather than people or livestock, the cart has two wooden wheels, 
each made from the same old and weathered wood as the rest of the 
vehicle. Hitched to the cart is a grey donkey, its coat a bit 
dirty and in need of grooming.

Norgoam jet-black jet white white-streaked charger UNIQUE_POFNISTRODIN byKodiak~
a jet-black, white-streaked charger~
A charger with a jet-black coat and a white streak is here.~
   Thick strands from jet-black fall over the chiseled muzzle of 
this large charger, though the forelock isn't quite lengthy 
enough to mute the sight of pair of deep brown eyes. Strikingly 
cutting through the sheer black of his coat is a jagged streak of 
ivory that rushes over the front of his face to slant over one of 
his nostrils, a stark contrast to the darkness about it. The 
white gradually fades into tones of grey which merely melts into 
black once more. In a similar fashion a slip of silvery-white is 
situated within his thick mane, the hair often tumbling about 
over his muscular, arched neck. Possessing large hooves 
feathered by locks of shaggy black, the steed boasts a formidable 
form and height, reaching to almost nineteen hands to its withers 
he boats powerful muscles along its flank.

Jackekh light grey stallion POFEORAN byKodiak~
a light-grey-coated stallion~
A light-grey-coated stallion is here, ears perked.~
   At fourteen hands, this horse is shorter than some of his 
thoroughbred counterparts, having a stocky, but muscular 
appearance. His unruly grey coat is rough and despite the animal 
not looking very old, his shade is light grey. Big brown eyes 
are placed on either side of his face, over a short muzzle and 
very large, yellowed teeth and gums. Overall, the stallion is 
rather tame and domesticated.

A powerful, silky-chestnut mare stands here.~
   This large horse is of average size for its breed, with a 
powerful, muscular look to it. Its coat is a beautiful shade of

a haughty, dark-skinned man~
A haughty, dark-skinned man stands here.~
   Tall and dark-complexioned, this man carries himself in an 
arrogant manner. His black hair is buzzed short, leading into a 
similarly-maintained beard that wraps around his pointed chin. 
His eyebrows arc upwards slightly at their ends, and his eyes are 
a dark brown. His frame is slim and underly-muscled, giving him 
a slightly emaciated look. He does, however, have a fairly wide 
chest, and his limbs are almost disproportionately long.

A short and stout, wrinkly old fellow with a bushy beard grins toothily.~
   This small, elderly fellow can not be more than two feet tall 
and seems comfortable with his naked and wrinkled form. The 
crown of his head is bald, however the rest of his body seems to 
be enveloped in a mat of furry hair. His eyebrows are bushy, his 
beard is long and his ears are unusually oversized. The long 
fingers that extend from his gnarled hands are accented with 
claw-like nails.

a large, docile looking black bear~
A large, docile looking black bear wanders here.~
   This large black bear is fully grown, and very large: their 
loose, fatty coat of fur and flesh covering its entire body, with 
strong mounds of muscles obvious beneath its skin. Large, black 
placcated looking eyes show this bear to be more docile than its 
angrier kin. It lumbers along on its large paws, often stopping 
to inspect birds' nests, berry bushes, and abandoned carcasses. 
Occassionally, the bear rears up to stand on its thick hind legs, 
rising to its full height where it towers over most Men.

Elswick foreman quarry man soot~
a soot-covered Miners' Foreman~
A soot-covered Miners' Foreman overlooks the Miners hard at work.~
   Of large, gruff build, attesting to his Northern heritage, 
this man is well-built and muscle-bound. He appears to be 
perpetually covered in soot and rock-dust from his work about the 
mines. His long, blond hair and scraggly chest-length beard is 
smeared with the dust and small metallic flecks. This Foreman's 
craggy face revealing a life long hours working in the mines.

Merendir guard tall inky young man POFARELION Arelion_Camp~
a tall, inky-haired young man~
A tall, inky-haired young man stands here, keeping guard.~
   This young man looks just barely into adulthood, but already 
bears the tell-tale signs of hardship. On either side of his 
slender nose are set grey eyes, which peer out keenly from a 
clean-shaven face. High cheekbones, an angular jaw, and slightly 
sunken eyes contribute to the shape of his face. He is tall and 
in good shape, his body comprised of well-defined muscle and 
sinew. He watches his post with clear determination.

A sleek, black-maned young stallion huffs spiritedly here.~
   Standing roughly at the height of a man's shoulder, this horse
maintains a proud and dignified facade. Its head is held high,
intelligent eyes glaring out into the distance, and a thick,
healthy-looking mane runs down the back of its neck. Its coat
appears well-cared-for, and a thick, knotted layer of muscle
ripples gracefully beneath its sleek skin.

Sinsir ginger roan draft furry horse cart CAO_GUILD~
a wooden cart pulled by a ginger-roan draft horse~
A wooden cart pulled by a ginger-roan draft horse stands here.~
   This wooden cart, formed of sanded and plain pine planks still 
maintains its astringent pine scent, a few knots in the wood 
still leaking sap. Built more for durability than luxury - its 
internal space for travelers or cargo has been laid with furs to 
provide some cushioning. The solidly-built ginger-roan colored 
draft horse that pulls this cart is a steady beast, with a thick 
body and strong legs with furry fetlocks. Though obviously 
strong, he appears calm and well-trained often sniffing at the 
ground for abandoned foodstuffs when not actively at work.

a happy nappy-coated mutt~
A happy nappy-coated mutt stands here, tail wagging.~
   This thin dog has no obvious heritage, and is decidedly 
smaller than a greater Wuldane. Though his fur has the clean 
appearance of a domesticated companion, its rough, swirled 
texture is given easily to napping and catching into snags. Of a 
mottled grey-brown color, a plethora of healed scars mar his 
body, though his troubled past has done little for his outlook - 
as more often than not he is found wagging his tail.

A strapping, golden-locked man stands here attentively.~
   This strapping man is a proud specimen of the Eothoed race - 
with shoulder-length golden hair with a single braid reaching 
from his left temple that crosses above his brow and ends below 
his right ear. He watches his post with a straight-backed 
assurance, but nodding respectfully to others that pass by. When 
his armor shifts, a rather grievous old scar can be seen running 
across his neck, though his sky-blue eyed face seems unmarred.

A ruddy, heavy-coated graehim switches her tail.~
   Standing about seventeen hands tall, this ruddy coated graehim 
mare stands firmly with a powerful, compact frame upon four 
thick, black hooves. Her coat is heavier than the norm for her 
breed, and she has a thick black mane and a wispy tuft of hair 
upon her head. Upon her nose is a broad, white stripe leading 
down to a pair of black lips and a dark muzzle. Her eyes are 
deep hazel and regard the world with subtle looking wisdom.

a thin, man-shaped shadow~
A thin, man-shaped shadow chills the air here.~
   This being is little more than a wisp of shadow, with the 
misty, see-through appearance of smoke. Despite its clear lack 
of solid form, it casts dark and forbodding shadows about itself, 
bathing any area it stands in in an unnatural twilight and cold. 
Though little if anything can be seen of this figure's face aside 
from two glowing amber-colored eyes, its form appears more 
masculine than feminine, and decidedly malevolent.

a red-and-white cart pulled by a grey-mottled mare~
A red-and-white cart pulled by a grey-mottled mare is stationed here.~
   This cart as been fashioned from sturdy oak planking. It's 
simple in design, but a lidless box atop two axles of sanded 
wood, each bearing two wooden-spoked wheels banded with iron 
strips. Slightly weathered is the red and white paint work, 
obviously having been exposed to rougher elements on more than 
one occasion. Well groomed is the grey-mottled horse at the 
helm, the equine used for labor rather then riding, her body 
being stout and strong. A small bench has been constructed 
towards the front of the cart, leaving space for a driver and a 
companion to sit beside one another.

Ork pale blue-eyed hulking wuldane hound POFLILUNE~
a pale blue-eyed, hulking wuldane hound~
A pale blue-eyed, hulking wuldane hound is here.~
   This hound is positively massive in size, standing about three 
feet tall at the shoulder. Even with his height, his breadth is 
even more impressive, heavily muscled and possessed of a good 
layer of thick fat that makes him seem even bigger. His wide 
face and long muzzle are white with touches of pale brown, the 
blaze of paler color continuing under his chin and over his 
stomach. The rest of his thick coat is a mottled combination of 
dark and light brown. The tips of his pointed, wolf-like ears 
are perked alertly, touched with slight hints of black that 
matches his large, wet nose in hue. His slanted eyes are a pale, 
striking blue, ringed with ebony that highlights their lightness. 
His limbs are somewhat thinner than the rest of him, and end in 
surprisingly dainty-looking feet, the blaze of white on his 
underside traveling down to color them as well. A long, shaggy 
tail flags out behind him, wagging from side to side at the 
slightest provocation.

a proud, long-tailed roan gelding~
A proud, long-tailed roan gelding stands here.~
   Of a soft roan color, this horse's form is sleek and compact 
compared to a more purebred warhorse, indicating the likelihood 
of some mixed Elaehim and Graehim lineage. Standing at seventeen 
hands, this gelding displays a proud if not haughty temperment, 
his long pale-blonde tail held aloft at the same bearing. A 
light pale-blonde feathering dominates his lower fetlocks, though 
otherwise the horse is uniform in his strawberry coloring.

#2A great cedar tree stands here, overshadowing everything.#0~
   This mammoth tree rises nearly twenty feet in the air and the 
span of it's canopy reaches almost as wide across. The trunk of 
the tree is huge and would take at least four men's arm-spans to 
surround it. Deep roots dig into the ground, drawing sustenance 
for this great tree from deep within the earth. This tree is 
old, almost ancient. It's bark is thick and healthy, capable of 
turning away even a sharp blade for a while.

A large, powerful grey and white wuldane~
A large, powerful grey and white wuldane stands here, tail wagging.~
   This puppy has grown out of his fat now and his muscles have 
developed into those of a powerful adult wuldane. Over his skin 
is a thick coat of bristling grey fur leading down his muzzle 
which contains a set of razor sharp teeth within his powerful 
jaws, while his underside is pure white and his legs are thick 
and end in large paws.

Feril hound wuldane wulfish dog brindled coat xpofCalathen~
a large, wolfish hound with a brindled coat~
A large, wolfish hound with a brindled coat is here.~
   This large dog is rather wolfish in appearance, with a thick, 
bristly coat of grey, black, and orange fur, with white, like 
salt, sprinkled in between. She has a sharp snout with even 
sharper teeth and long, rangy limbs, taut with lean muscle. Her 
eyes are a piercing and deep blue in color. A quartet of keen 
claws extend from each paw and, along with the razor sharp points 
within her maw, give her quite a fierce appearance.

Gwin chocolate brown draft furry horse cart POFCAIHANA~
a wooden cart pulled by a chocolate-brown draft horse~
A wooden cart pulled by a chocolate-brown draft horse stands here.~
   This wooden cart, formed of sanded and plain pine planks still 
maintains its astringent pine scent, a few knots in the wood 
still leaking sap. Built more for durability than luxury - its 
internal space for travelers or cargo has been laid with furs to 
provide some cushioning. The strong-looking chocolate-brown 
draft horse that pulls this cart is a steady beast, with a thick 
body and strong legs with furry fetlocks. Though obviously 
strong, he appears calm and well-trained often sniffing at the 
ground for abandoned foodstuffs when not actively at work.
