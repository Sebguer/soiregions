Baseroom for Osgiliath~
   This is the base room for the city of Osgiliath. 
   Original Room Allotments:' 
   Rooms 2100 - 2350 is the range of the city. Kept small 
because it burns down eventually. 
   The rest of the allotments are way outdated. 
   Regardless, please check all new building with Nix beforehand. 
Osgiliath's mapping is off in many places and she is fixing it. 
Maybe it burns down in three RL years, but that's no reason to 
not have a fixed Osgiliath now; plus, sensible mapping (okay, so 
Nix goes by a somewhat unorthodox mapping system, but it works 
out) will make it easier to replace this Osgiliath with the 
burnt-down, rubble strewn one eventually.

Ramp Leading East Into the Gates of Osgiliath~
   The road of Lond Caras-Mir approaches from the west, sloping 
upwards as it runs to the base of the large wooden gates of the 
city of Osgiliath to the east. Black and white cobblestones form 
an alternating pattern in the road, yet the effect is marred by a 
moderate amount of stones missing. Two towers branching outwards 
from the wall of the city overlook the ramp, bordering it north 
and south. Armoured guardsmen look down at the merchants and 
farmers who pass along the road from above, and a large flag 
hangs from each tower.

Under the Gates of Osgiliath~
   This short passage has been cut through the white limestone 
walls of the city Osgiliath, once the capital of Gondor in 
ancient times. A pair of torches hanging on the north and south 
side on the passage fill the area with flickering yellow light 
and add to its stuffy smell and atmosphere. Arrow slits and 
murder holes line the roof and walls here, ready to pour down 
fire and arrows upon any hostile force attempting to enter the 
city. A heavy iron portcullis is set at the east end of the 
passageway, while a large wooden gate opens out to the west.

Crossing of Roads East of the City Gates~
   An enlarged square of black and white cobblestones has been 
placed here with roads joining from the north, south and east, an 
iron portcullis set in the city wall westwards. Farmers, lower 
class merchants and vagrants all mill about here, heading to and 
from the streets leading off. Dirt can be seen in places where 
paving stones are missing, and this is far from an uncommon 
occurrence. Four cast-iron lamp posts, rusted with old age but 
still able to bear light in the darkness, have been set in each 
of the four corners of this crossroads.

Rath Gil North of a Market~
   Rath Gil, the main street of the ancient city of Osgiliath, 
leads to the east and west here, passing by double story 
buildings of mediocre wooden construction. Twin rows of battered 
street lamps run parallel to the street as it cuts its way 
through the heart of the city, providing yellow lamp light in the 
darkness of night. A light flow of poorly dressed people move 
along Rath Gil, yet the occasional finely attired merchant can be 
seen moving among them.

North of The Coach and Hall Tavern~
   Following the route of Rath Gil here as it heads east and west 
are the common citizens of the western half of the city 
Osgiliath, passing by houses and buildings in poor condition. 
The street was at one point paved with black and white 
cobblestones, but now numerous potholes and a thick layer of dirt 
force a close inspection to reveal them at all. In the distance 
to the east a large, dome-shaped building can be seen, while 
immediately to the south a cedar-wood tavern borders the street.

West of a Large Intersection on Rath Gil~
   White-washed buildings line the street of Rath Gil as it heads 
from the city gates to the Star Dome that lays at the heart of 
the city of Osgiliath. Commoners mill about the area here, 
consisting mostly of farmers bringing in their products to sell 
in the markets as well as citizens of the sparsely populated 
city. Underfoot runs a packed dirt road, the occasional basalt 
or limestone flagstone cropping out from it. An intersection of 
two streets lies to the east, while a blacksmith store sits upon 
the northern edge of Rath Gil here. 

To the south lies a pile of charred timber and refuse.

Intersection of Rath Gil and Rath Earendil~
   Through this area two streets of Osgiliath meet in a slightly 
enlarged area. With routes leading to this small square from the 
north, east, south and west it sees a good flow of traffic, 
mostly ill-dressed citizens of the city but also a number of 
wagons and farmers. Cobblestones and hard-packed dirt vie for 
dominance throughout the square here, the flagstones long past 
any organised attempt at maintenance. The white walls of the city 
can be seen rising over the wooden buildings in all directions 
save to the east, where a large domed structure cut from stone 
can be seen.

Rath Gil Before the Dome of Stars~
   Rising up high above the rooftops of the slightly dilapidated 
housing of Osgiliath to the east is the Star Dome, once the 
palace of the Kings of Gondor, yet such times are no more. Built 
from square blocks of limestone, the weather has taken its toll 
upon the walls and dome of the building, with large holes into 
the stone visible from street level. The remnants of what may 
have once been a balcony out of the dome juts out from a hole in 
the side, and below it lies a set of tall doors made from oak. 
   A small, wooden store lies southwards, while an intersection 
of streets can be seen to the west.

Large Engry Hall of the Dome of Stars~
   Spacious enough to accommodate many dozen guests, the ample 
room provided in this substantial entry hall goes largely unused, 
the only people present the odd commoner or merchant moving east 
to west through the interior. The stone walls of this foyer are 
chipped and damaged, large pieces of the masonry simply gone from 
the sides of the walls. What might have once been fine 
tapestries and ancient banners of war now hang from rusted 
cast-iron hooks in tatters, ravaged by moths over the years. 
   A set of large doors of dark-grained maple wood cover the 
archway that leads out of the entry hall to the west, bearing 
many scratches and cuts along their surfaces, while to the east a 
corridor stretches out, leading further into the Star Dome.

Pillared Corridor Through the Dome of Stars~
   Pillars of fluted stonework raise up to support the high roof 
of this corridor. While they may have once been impressive 
displays of skill and craftsmanship, now the columns show many 
signs of damage, large sections of the masonry smashed out from 
the structures. The floor has been designed with an intricate 
pattern of white, grey and black stones, yet, like the pillars, 
bears the signs of neglect. 
   Eastwards the corridor approaches a large bridge spanning a 
wide river, while to the west a spacious foyer to the building

Before the Bele-Iant Under the Dome of Stars~
   High above overhead, the dome of this stone building rises 
upward; sloping towards its apex located a distance eastwards. 
Running under the dome and towards the centre of the colossal 
roof is the Bele-Iant, the mighty bridge that spans the width of 
the River Anduin and connects the two halves of the city 
Osgiliath. Cool currents run through the air here is this space, 
larger than a bustling city square, before the stalwart bridge, 
the breezes delivered straight from the dark waters that flow 
from north to south. 
   In all other directions save to that the Bele-Iant takes, a 
trio of corridors lead through the Dome of Stars.

Upon the Great Bridge of Osgiliath~
   Wide enough to bear four wagons moving side by side along its 
length, the Great Bridge of Osgiliath rightfully bears its name. 
Solid blocks of limestone, strong enough to easily bear whatever 
weight may pass over it, make up the bridge as it connects the 
eastern and western sections of the Star Dome, as well as the 
city of Osgiliath. 
   The bridge continues far to the east, whilst westwards it 
connects to a plaza set in the Dome of Stars.

Above the Waters of the Anduin River on the Bele-Iant~
   Running east to west, a huge domed roof covers the Great 
Bridge of Osgiliath, as well as the entire area contained within 
it, light provided by a regular set of iron lampposts set above 
the stone guardrail at the edges of the bridge. Looking over the 
northern or southern sides reveals the waters of the River Anduin 
as they flow through what use to be the old palace of the city, 
small river vessels moving with the current downstream under the 
roof of the Dome of Stars. A chill zephyr often passes through 
the area, rising up from the cold waters below.

   An alternating pattern of black and white flagstones runs east

of Osgiliath that spans the length of the River Anduin, joins the 
two sides of the city together. The river flows from the north 
to the south, all under the roof of the Dome of Stars, graceful 
arches cut from the walls of the immense building to allow the 
water, as well as river vessels, to pass through the city. 
Raised some thirty feet from the cold flow, the stalwart stone 
structure of the bridge seems capable of bearing any force put 
upon it.

of the structure made possible through exemplary design and 
architecture. Cool limestone hewn from distant quarries allows 
one to make the passage from one side of the city of Osgiliath to

reaching its domed apex a distance to the west. The limestone 
walls curve down in all directions, huge gaping arches visible to 
the north and south letting through the flow of the River Anduin 
as the current draws its chill waters southwards through the Star 
Dome. Waist height guardrails run along the edges of the bridge 
as its black and white surface spans the width of the Anduin east 
and west, tall lampposts set behind them casting down light. 
   To the east, the bridge begins to slope downward, leading into 
a large plaza at the end of the Bele-Iant, the Grand Bridge of 
Osgiliath.

Spacious Plaza Before the Bele-Iant~
   The corridors of the Star Dome that lead off to the north, 
south and east open up here in this large plaza, reaching the 
size of a city square. Benches lay placed in ideal locations 
about the area to provide respite, and statues of past kings and 
queens of Gondor rise up from the black and white chequered 
floor. Yet, all the marble depictions bear damage ranging from 
mere scratches to entire sections broken off, and the benches 
bear the weight of cobwebs and dust. 
   Corridors branch out in every direction, save to the west, 
where the grand expanse of the Bele-Iant bridges the Anduin.

   Fluted stonework makes up the broad pillars that support the 
stone ceiling enclosing the corridor. A chequered pattern of 
black and white tiles runs underfoot, heading from east to west 
in the broad passageway large enough to allow the progression of 
a trade caravan. Yet the only background sounds here are the 
footsteps of the occasional passer-by or watchman, the splendour 
of the grand architecture of this hallway, and the entire Star 
Dome, seemingly abandoned. Dust and spider webs occupy the upper 
arches where the pillars meet the roof work, and upon closer 
inspection many small nicks and scars can be seen to mar the 
edges of the stone.

Entry Hall to the Dome of Stars~
   Easily wide enough to allow a dozen soldiers abreast to march 
through without great hindrance, the days of such displays seem 
long gone in this entry hall to the Dome of Stars, the building 
that in ancient times served as the palace to the Kings of 
Gondor. Circular in shape, numerous small iron hooks ring around 
the room, perhaps once holding fine tapestries and adornments but 
now they carry no burden. 
   A long, straight-set corridor bordered by stone pillars leads 
off to the west, cutting through the heart of the Star Dome, 
whilst a pair of large oak doors, twice as tall as a man, rest in 
the eastern wall. A wide staircase set on the northern edge of 
the room leads up to another pair of smaller, yet equally stout 
doors.

Rath Gil at the Entrance to the Dome of Stars~
   The broad street of Rath Gil progresses no further to the 
west, the cause of this being the gigantic building hewn from 
limestone that rises up, its domed facade set high over the 
timber rooftops of Eastern Osgiliath. A pair of huge oak doors 
are set into an archway at the base of the Dome of Stars, their 
wood well oiled despite obvious age. Graceful pillars line the 
distance between the housing of Rath Gil and the entrance to the 
Dome. Despite their skillful construction, the stone is pitted 
throughout and many small nicks and scars can be seen throughout 
the structure of not only the pillars but the base of the Dome of 
Stars itself. Eastwards, Rath Gil continues onward through the 
fine houses that border it.

Broad Intersection of Two Streets~
   A wide square has been created here where two broad streets of 
Eastern Osgiliath cross over. Rath Ostoher leads from north to 
south whilst Rath Gil runs east to west, both of them paved in a 
chequered pattern of black and white cobblestones. A huge 
building built from hewn limestone can be spotted to the west, a 
short distance down along Rath Gil. As large as this 
intersection is, the flow of traffic that should be present here 
is disturbingly lacking.

Rath Gil Runs East and West~
   As the age old street of Rath Gil leads from east to west here 
through the city of Osgiliath, a hushed silence falls about it 
during most times of the day. Constructed from both stone and 
wood, those buildings are of fine architecture, yet many bear 
signs of neglect, with flaking paint and splintered shutters.

   Named in a similar fashion to Osgiliath itself, the Fortress 
of Stars, Rath Gil leads through the entirety of the city, from 
west gate to east gate. Past the rooftops of the well built, yet 
dilapidated buildings of the city the gigantic Dome of Stars can 
be seen to the west, its magnificent structure once housing the 
Kings of Gondor. 
   A short flight of stone steps to the south lead up to an 
ornate front door, providing access to an impressive stone 
building.

On Rath Gil, Passing Closed Shops~
   Square flagstones made of basalt and limestone have been set 
together with little space between them to make up the street of 
Rath Gil. Despite the odd pothole in the road, it has been kept 
in good condition considering the sparse population of Osgiliath 
that treads upon it. Bordering the street to the north and 
south, past the lines of rusting iron lampposts, are twin rows of 
houses in which the residences of Eastern Osgiliath reside. 
Possessing architecture of an old Gondorian style, the stone and 
wood constructions have been well designed yet not received the 
proper maintenance over the years. To the north, what used to 
be an armaments shop has been closed, secured with a chain and
a thick iron padlock. Rath Gil continues to the east and west.

Intersection Before the City Gates~
   Two streets meet here before the towering form of the city 
wall and gates, Rath Romendacil entering from the north and south 
whilst Rath Gil runs in from the west. In the early hours of the 
morning a shadow falls across the junction, the twenty-foot high 
stone structure to the east that encloses the city of Osgiliath. 
Four lampposts set in the corners of the junction do their best 
to ward off this shade, as well as provide illumination during 
the hours of night. A heavy portcullis is set in the base of the 
wall to the east, a constant presence of guards visible 
throughout the area to ensure nothing with harmful intent enters 
the city.

Below the Eastern Gates~
   This passage leads between the interior and exterior of the 
city of Osgiliath, and is perhaps wide enough for four horsemen 
to ride through abreast. Cut from the off-white stones that make 
up the walls of the city, a pair of torch sconces set on the 
north and south walls casts a flickering, orange light over the 
tunnel. A small iron portcullis has been placed at the western 
entrance, the distance between ceiling and iron bars bridges as 
the stone roof slopes downward. The ceiling lies high overhead, 
giving the gatehouse an airy feel. Heavy iron-reinforced oaken 
gates seal the city from the dangers to the east, its thick doors 
resting upon stout hinges. The stone directly next to the gates 
looks newer than the surrounding masonry, likely recently cut 
from a quarry.

Northern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The bank of the river here is mostly barren with only the 
occasional bush or shrub brightening it up. The water of the 
river laps over pebbles and rocks immediately by the waters edge 
and as the bank leaves the water it slopes upward quite quickly. 
Few animals can be heard and even fewer can be seen, travellers 
here are basically nonexistent.

Rath Earnil North of an Intersection~
   Winding north and south alongside the limestone city wall that 
lies to the west, Rath Earnil takes its name after one of the 
many ancient Kings of Gondor, that line now passed and the 
Stewards ruling in their place. This section of the city of 
Osgiliath has fallen into a rather derelict state, with many of 
the buildings bordering the eastern side of the street in near 
ruin, or nothing more then an ancient heap of rock, some so old 
that vines have begun to snake through the rubble. A guard tower 
lies to the west, while progress south leads to a crossing of 
streets.

Rath Earnil Leads North and South by the City Wall~
   The gloom of dusk comes early to the street of Rath Earnil, 
brought upon by the twenty-foot high white stone wall that rises 
up from the packed dirt of the road to the west. The occasional 
odd cobblestone, varying in make from limestone to basalt, pokes 
out underfoot in the street, for the most part hard, brown dirt 
leading the way north and south. Bordering the street on the 
east is a row of ramshackle buildings built from scrap wood, 
climbing upward from age-old stone remains scattered around 
before them.

A Turn East to South on Rath Earnil~
   The normal straight progression of Rath Earnil is forced to 
shift here as the Osgiliath city wall turns from the east to the 
south here. Set in perpetual twilight during the day due to the 
passage of the wall, and near pitch blackness at night, the 
street here is not made of cobblestones, instead composed of 
hard-packed dirt that quickly turns to mud in wet weather. Few 
people move by here, those that do raggedly clothed and attired.

Rath Earnil Leads North and West~
   A corner is created in the walls of Osgiliath as the northern 
and western walls meet, indenting slightly before continuing 
their straight set path marking the perimeter of the city. Rath 
Earnil leads by at the base of the battlements, following the 
path dictated by them. Ramshackle shanties built from scavenged 
material border the packed dirt street, the occasional old ruin 
of stone nestled between the closely packed residences. 
Northwards Rath Earnil ends, becoming Rath Cemendur as the dirt 
road leads east to west by the wall.

   The unpaved dirt road of Rath Cemendur ends here to the south 
as it meets with another street at a corner in the city walls of 
Osgiliath. Eastwards it continues on, running past a row of 
houses in poor condition, many looking to be scant inches away 
from collapsing. Large, squared blocks of limestone sit heavily 
to the north and west of Rath Cemendur, a constant patrol of 
guardsmen moving past along them. Down on the street few people 
can be seen moving by, those that do dressed in little more then 
rags.

North of a Rundown Shop on Rath Cemendur~
   Rath Cemendur, like many streets in the semi-deserted city of 
Osgiliath, is named after one of the ancient Gonodorian kings, 
that line now sadly passed from the face of Arda. Despite its 
royal name, the buildings that lie on the southern edge of packed 
earth road are in ruinous conditions, many of the makeshift 
wooden and daub-and-wattle structures built up from a carpet of 
limestone rubble. Opposite them is the towering city wall, 
though it to is in far from a pristine condition. A small shop, 
a battered wooden sign without any markings hanging above it, 
lies to the south.

Rath Cemendur Passes Dilapidated Buildings~
   From east to west the street of Rath Cemendur runs here, no 
cobblestones marking its way, instead dirt packed by the tread of 
feet guiding the course of the road as it runs parallel to the 
city wall that borders to the north. Only the occasional vagrant 
or lower class citizen of the west side of Osgiliath travels down 
this way, all intent on their own business and keeping a distance 
from the irregular patrol of guardsmen passing through. Climbing 
up from the ruins of age-old buildings to the south, much like a 
growth of mushrooms, are the dinghy shanties and shacks that 
house many of the population of Osgiliath.

Junction of Three Roads~
   Three of West Osgiliath's winding dirt roads meet here at a 
brief junction. Rath Cemendur and Rath Earnedil lead west and 
south respectively, while a narrow street seeming more like a 
path through the overhanging derelict buildings leads east. A 
number of cast iron street lamps, long ago succumbed to rust, 
rise up higher then the head of a man here, but no wicks nor 
fresh oil is delivered to them anymore, and as such they cast no 
light out onto the light trickle of ill-attired commoners that

Dirt Path to the East of a Junction~
   Large, derelict double-story buildings loom up meanceingly 
over this thin dirt path as it leads east and west. Perhaps once 
bustling warehouses full of goods and laborers, now they stand 
abandoned, their dark wooden walls contrasting bleakly against 
the limestone city wall that rises up to the north behind them. 
A still silence holds over this area here, the only sounds being 
the pattering footsteps of the lone wanderer through this area 
played upon a backdrop of the noises of the near deserted city of 
Osgiliath. A junction lies to the west, while to the east white 
stoned rubble accumulates up to a large mound.

Shanties and Hovels Border Rath Earendil to the East and West~
   Cropping out of the dirt road of Rath Earendil are the 
fragments and remains of the black and white cobblestones once 
used to pave the road. Now encrusted by the dust of the earth, 
they are unheeded by the slight trickle of people that walk from 
north to south, following the progression of the street. On 
either side of Rath Earendil an odd assortment of buildings scale 
up, constructed from daub-and-wattle and wooden timbers, to 
misfitting and scavenged stone. More often then not, they seem 
abandoned, with collapsed roofs and rotting wood.

North and South on Rath Earendil~
   Through day and night, a light movement of human traffic walks 
upon the street of Rath Earendil as it leads north and south 
through West Osgiliath. Named so after a king of Gondor of days 
long gone past, there is little of the splendour traditionally 
associated with royalty upon the street, the packed dirt of the 
road often rising up dust to light coat the clothing of 
passer-by's and in wet weather quickly turning to mud. The 
shanty-like buildings that house the populace of this section of 
the city line the street to the west and a recently replaced, 
pale cedar fence borders the road to the east.

Through the Slums of Osgiliath on Rath Earendil~
   The gentle sounds of the city of Osgiliath float lazily past 
one's ears here, the quiet steps of passerbys upon the dirt road, 
the distant striking of metal, a faint rumbling progress of a 
wagon and other slight noises. Buildings in slum conditions are 
set either side of the unpaved street of Rath Earendil as it 
leads north and south, little noise emerging from those either. 
The white city walls can be seen afar to the north, and the 
curved top of the Dome of Stars is barely visible above the 
rooftops to the east. 
   An intersection of this street and a slightly broader road 
lies to the south, and a ramshackle shop stands just to the east.

Rath Earendil South of a Meeting of Streets~
   Black and white cobblestones have been laid down on the road 
of Rath Earendil as it leads north and south through the west 
side of the city of Osgiliath. Brown dirt potholes are common 
throughout the street, as is a layer of hard packed dirt over the 
cobblestones in some places. A row of tall lampposts run 
parallel to Rath Earendil's progression here, and though many of 
them are damaged and rusted, some are still capable of shining 
out to provide light to the sparse citizens of the city during 
the hours of night.

Between Decrepit Buildings Alongside Rath Earendil~
   Following the irregular paved street as it cuts a path north 
and south through the city are a number of roughly attired and 
ill kept commoners native to Osgiliath. The occasional wagon 
drawn by horse or donkey rattles over the cobblestones of Rath 
Earendil, taking goods to and from the docks of the city that lay 
to the south-east. Buildings of wildly varying quality, from 
scrap shanties to daub and wattle cottages to ancient wooden 
townhouses look down at the light traffic that treks on below 
them, viewed past the row of lamp posts that burn brightly at 
night. To the west a sign hangs out from a shopfront, a hammer 
and chisel painted upon it.

Rath Earendil Meets a Junction to the South~
   A quiet hush has settled into place in the street of Rath 
Earendil, as well as much of the western half of the city of 
Osgiliath. The patter of boots and rumble of wagons on the 
sparse cobblestones of the road, quiet conversations of people 
about their business and the occasional shout of a child is all 
the noise encountered through this quiet section of what was once 
the royal capital of Gondor. Towering above the dilapidated 
houses at the end of the street a distance to the north and 
nearby to the south are the city walls of Osgiliath, constructed 
from large blocks of limestone cut to size and placed atop one 
another with remarkable engineering. A doorway leading into a 
shop lies to the east and southwards Rath Earendil leads into 
another street.

Approaching an Intersection to the North on Rath Earnil~
   Rath Earnil leads to the south from here, following the 
limestone walls of the city as they to dictate a straight path in 
the southwards direction. A rough city square lies to the east 
and north, white and black cobblestones laid down over the area 
as it bears the feet and wheels of farmers and their carts 
entering the city of Osgiliath to trade in the market stalls set 
up throughout the area. The street here however quickly sheds 
its cobbles for packed dirt as it continues to the south. To the 
west a narrow stone staircase leads up to a tower jutting out 
from the city walls.

Rath Earnil Between the Battlements and Market~
   Large blocks of grainy white limestone squared off to near 
perfection are placed atop of each other to form a towering wall 
that lies to the west, more than twice the height of the tallest 
man. Though still mighty in terms of height and width, faint 
cracks and other minor damage to the wall is visible from the 
dirt street of Rath Earnil that runs at the base of it as it 
heads north and south. Few people pass along the road, those 
that do almost to a man dressed in poor quality clothing, yet a 
short distance to the east a crowded market can be seen, the 
shouts and sounds of commerce echoing off the stone wall.

Rath Earnil Turns North and East With the Wall~
   Poorly dressed and ill-kept citizens of the western side of 
Osgiliath funnel through the narrow dirt road of Rath Earnil, 
squeezed between the stalwart city walls that lie to the west and 
south as they turn here and the collection of amateurly made 
dwellings opposite the limestone structure. An oppressive 
silence lingers here, heavy with the history of the once mighty 
capital of the nation of Gondor, broken by the occasional burst 
of sound somewhere from the farmer markets of the city that lay 
to the north.

   As the western and southern sections of the city wall meet 
here, so do the streets of Rath Earnil and Rath Anardil. Both 
are littered with the fragmented remains of black and white 
cobblestones, and they lead to the south and to the west in a 
near perpetual gloom during the day, the shadow cast over them 
project by the towering stone blocks of the city wall. A light 
scattering of garbage and refuse left by even the most ardent of 
scavengers litters the path as it nears the wall, the sign of 
poverty mirrored by the shanties and shacks that border the two 
streets to the north and south. Rath Earnil leads off here west, 
and Rath Anardil south.

Western End of Rath Anardil~
   Rath Anardil, so named in honour of one of the many past kings 
of Gondor, is nothing more then a road of dirt and sometimes mud 
that runs at the base of the southern city wall of Osgiliath. It 
narrows slightly as it heads to the west here before turning off 
to the north where it merges with another street, the edges of 
the street pushed closer together by the row of dilapidated and 
decrepit buildings that scrabble up from the ground on the north 
side of the road. The occasional methodical plod of a patrolling 
guardsmen or slow step of a busy commoner are indications of the 
slight flow of human traffic through the area.

Rath Anardil Runs East and West~
   A very slight upwards climb can be observed here on street of 
Rath Anardil as it heads further eastwards, the reverse being 
true to those who progress to the west. The dirt trail that 
makes up the road is free of any debris or obstacle, more likely 
due to the few people that inhabit this section of the city of 
Osgiliath then any conscious effort on their behalf to keep it 
clean. Calm and quiet rule over this section of western 
Osgiliath, the occasional shout or voice breaking the silence, 
but otherwise the complacent atmosphere hangs heavy in the air.

Rath Anardil Alongside the City Wall~
   This stretch of Rath Anardil runs the east to west in a 
straight course, its road composed of a thick layer of dirt under 
which the occasional odd flagstone can be seen. On the northern 
edge of the road runs a row of double story houses constructed 
from timber of all sorts, pine, cedar and oak being the dominant 
styles. Some of the buildings have been built up from older 
stone structures that from the first half of the bottom floor, 
more often then not covered in vines and other noxious weeds. 
Opposite the houses is the southern wall of the city of 
Osgiliath, rising twenty feet high in the air and constructed 
from squared blocks of white, grainy limestone.

Junction of Rath Earendil and Rath Anardil~
   The two streets of Rath Earendil and Rath Anardil meet here, 
the former continuing at the base of the colossal city walls 
heading east and west while the latter branching out to cut 
through to the north past the decrepit buildings of the city of 
Osgiliath. Hard dirt, packed down by the constant trampling of 
feet, is the medium of the road here, yet a few remaining 
flagstones of basalt or limestone rock can be seen jutting out 
defiantly from the road. A faint murmur of voices and passer-bys 
rings through the area, the increased traffic and noise in the 
city due to the proximity of the docks at the end of Rath 
Earendil to the east.

By Whitewashed Buildings on Rath Anardil~
   On the northern side of the street of Rath Anardil numerous 
dilapidated and decrepit houses lie, providing shelter for 
citizens of the west side of Osgiliath. Many of the aging wooden 
townhouses have been coated with white wash, but a significant 
number bear ancient layers of flaking paint or simply showing 
plain wooden timbers. People walk from east to west here along 
the dirt road of Rath Anardil, weaving in and out of the numerous 
wagons that head up from the docks at the end of the street to 
the east. Opposite the row of shanties, shacks and under 
substandard dwellings is the south city wall, rising twenty feet 
into the air and towering above all below it.

North of a Portcullis in the City Wall~
   The street of Rath Anardil ends here to the east as a solid 
stone railing prevents careless wanderers from plunging into the 
River Anduin that flows some dozen feet below. Across the fast 
flowing water of the river the eastern side of the city of 
Osgiliath can be seen, and bridging the two halves to the 
northeast is the gigantic Star Dome and the mighty bridge that 
runs through it. A portcullis is set in the limestone wall to 
the south, allowing access to the south down to the docks of 
Osgiliath.

   The white, grainy limestone that makes up the stones of 
Osgiliath that lay in all directions, whether in the huge, 
square-cut blocks that hang overhead or the rectangular cobbles 
used to pave this section through the walls. Burning torches 
dispel the darkness to the corners of the low ceiling of the 
passageway there, regularly replaced by the armoured guardsmen 
that move through this area. To the north and south heavy iron 
portcullis' have been placed over the entrances and exits that 
lead out of this space, allowing access to either the inner city 
of Osgiliath or its southern docks.

Before the Sea-Gate to the North~
   A rocky outcrop from the portcullis that leads inside the 
western section of Osgiliath extends out here over the dark River 
Anduin as it flows from north to south. A stone fence ravaged by 
the weather borders around the edge of the rock formation, 
providing some deterrence against the drop into the cold waters 
below. Eastwards a flattened path of dirt descends alongside the 
limestone wall down to the docks of the city. A pair of banners 
of the colors gold upon royal blue hang from iron posts set in 
two turrets jutting out from the limestone wall to the north.

Dirt Path Leading Down to the Docks~
   Leading with a moderate slope to the east and west at the base 
of the Southern Wall of the city of Osgiliath, the path is not so 
difficult that the frequent wagons that travel along it can't 
move at a fair speed. It is wide enough to just allow a wagon to 
squeeze past people walking on the packed dirt of the path. The 
remnants of an ancient stone fence run along the southern side of 
it, designed to stop utterly careless people from walking over 
the edge of the rocky outcrop of the city walls and into the 
waters of the swift river below.

The Osgiliath Docks Near the City Wall~
   Oak planks have been laid down over larger beams to form the 
wooden boardwalk of the Osgiliath Docks built at the base of the 
limestone city walls of the city itself. Held above the waters 
of the River Anduin that flows past to the south and east, 
activity is never far away on the docks, with barges and other 
river craft tying up and casting off, bringing goods to and from 
the city for trade along other cities located along the river. A 
dirt path leads down to the docks from the west, where it quickly 
climbs up a rocky formation. A pier lies to the south, and the 
boardwalk continues to the east.

Wooden Platform of the Osgiliath Docks Spreading West and South~
   The wooden boardwalk of the Osgiliath docks ends to the east 
here, branching off in a number of smaller wharves, jetties and 
piers. Barges, skiffs, dinghies and other river craft engage in 
the continuous activity of mooring up to and casting off from the 
docks here, sailors and porters loading and unloading goods and 
cargo at all hours of the day and night. The waters of the 
Anduin are visible between slight gaps in the planking and over 
the side-rails, and the south wall of Osgiliath rises a slight 
distance away to the northwest. 
   The boardwalk continues to the west and east.

White Wooden Wharf Off the Osgiliath Docks~
   White paint has liberally been applied to this wide wharf as 
it leads off over the dark waters of the River Anduin and off the 
docks of Osgiliath that lie to the north. A slight flow of river 
traffic casts off and ties up to the various beams of its length, 
sailors and merchants clustering about the docks hauling and 
checking away at the cargo the small river craft of the Anduin 
ferry back and forth across its waters. To the north the tall 
city walls can be seen, the various warehouses and buildings of 
the docks cluttered around the base of that limestone structure.

Fishing Pier off the Docks~
   Jutting out from the boardwalk of the docks from the north, 
this pier is in good condition, recieving constant repairs over 
the years. A number of people sit over the edges of its oak 
beams with fishing lines cast into the River Anduin that flows 
below, out seeking whatever luck they can find in the way of 
fish. Small dinghies and other vessels occasionally pull up to 
moor on the pier before heading off down stream. Further 
westwards the western shore of the river can be seen, and the 
lands of Anorien beyond. In the opposite direction the docks 
stretch out a short distance, then the broad expanses of the 
Anduin.

Upon a Rickety Pier, Over Deep Waters~
   The ravages of time and weather have begun to take their toll 
upon the short planks of the boardwalk of this small pier that 
leads out from the main platform of the Osgiliath docks. Moss 
grows abundantly at the base of the large beams of wood set on 
the north and south sides of the pier, and overhead birds soar 
looking out for the discards of the numerous fishermen here. A 
ways to the northwest the great walls of Osgiliath loom into the 
air, bending northward toward a domed building that stretches 
across the river to rejoin with the eastern half of Osgiliath on 
the other side.

Railed Corridor Overlooking the River Anduin~
   Upon the western border of this corridor is lined with a row 
of graceful stone pillars, the product of artisans long passed 
from the face of Arda. Opposite these is a railing of the same 
white limestone as the columns, raising up to about mid-height 
and designed with the some elegance. Their purpose is clear; to 
prevent the careless wanderer from plunging off the edge of the 
passageway and down into the swiftly flowing waters of the River 
Anduin a good dozen feet below. The domed roof of this building 
rises high overhead, whilst above the head to the west a 
structure has been set atop the columns, the arched windows 
holding smashed panes of glass and cobwebs. 
   The corridor continues north, and to the south it runs toward 
a wide intersection.

Passageway Through the Dome of Stars Above the River Anduin~
   A cool draft, chill even in the warmest moments of summer, 
blows off from the surface of the River Anduin that flows a dozen 
feet below the base of this corridor that leads through the Dome 
of Stars. Once the palace to the Kings of Gondor, those time of 
glory and splendour have long faded, with the westward set stone 
columns that support the overhanging stone structure chipped in 
many places, spider webs growing abundantly in the upper corners. 
Few people walk through this passageway now, the occasional 
jiggling sound of an armoured guardsman breaking through the 
oppressive silences settled over the area. 
   To the north, the corridor ends at a white stone wall, whilst 
an archway to the west provides access to a desolate room.

Hallway Looking Down at the River Anduin to the East~
   Leading north to south under the dome of this building set
high above, this corridor is lit by fresh torches burning from
sconces set in the sides of the fluted stone pillars, facing
eastwards. In that direction, a stone barrier runs along the
edge of the passageway, the railings shaped like vines as they
span from post to post, the structure designed to prevent any
from falling down into the swiftly flowing waters of the River
Anduin that stream from the north to south below. Only the
occasional armoured guardsman or dutiful servant moves along
here, intent on their duty as it carries them through the area.
   The corridor continues south, and to the north it runs toward
a wide intersection.

Southern End of the Dome of Stars~
   The fluted pillar corridor that runs between the buildings and 
River Anduin all contained under the Dome of Stars comes to an 
end here as it approached the south, the white stone wall of the 
building rising high up to the roof, which then curved to meet at 
its apex somewhere to the north-east. Much stone rubble, with 
the odd pieces of rotted wood, has been dumped at end of the 
corridor, small vines and leaves shooting through it. Few, if 
any, people travel down here anymore, yet still a lantern set by 
the waist-high guardrail before the drop to the river to the east 
casts yellowish light over the area. 
   The corridor stretches out to the north, and an archway to the 
west leads into a dusty, darkened room.

Pillard Hallway Leading North and South~
   A cool breeze blows softly through this corridor of the Dome 
of Stars, rising up from the cold waters of the River Anduin that 
run from north to south a short distance to the west. A stone 
guardrail prevents those without any sense from tumbling down 
twenty feet into the fast flowing river. From this vantage point 
a number of small river craft, barges and the like can be seen 
moving about, entering and leaving the gigantic Star Dome through 
a series of enormous arches cut from the stonework in the middle 
of the north and south sides. A single row of columns supports 
the structure that juts out over the corridor here, glass windows 
looking out onto the river.

Northern End of the Hallway~
   A row of lanterns rise up from the rail guard set along the 
western edge of this passageway as it leads one path through the 
Dome of Stars. Oil-garnered light is cast down onto the black 
and white stone pattern that makes up the floor, yet few people 
walk past to receive the benefits, those that do being mainly 
heavily armoured guardsmen on patrol. Dust and spider webs have 
claimed much of this area, snaking around the fluted stonework 
pillars heading north and south at the eastern edge of the 
corridor. No further progress can be made to the north along 
this route, the limestone wall of the Star Dome rising up, yet to 
the south the passageway continues, the Great Bridge of Osgiliath 
visible a small distance away.

Above the River Anduin on a Railed Corridor~
   Unlike much of the rest of the Dome of Stars, this broad 
corridor has been swept clean of dust and debris. Bordering the 
passageway to the west is a stone guardrail, patterned in running 
vines snaking about the lampposts that illuminate the area. High 
overhead is the dome of the building, its apex set a distance to 
the north-west over the Bele-Iant, the great bridge that 
stretches between the eastern and western side of the Star Dome. 
Guardsmen can often be seen marching up and down the corridor, 
and occasionally a scruffy commoner can be seen held securely in 
their grip.

   As the corridor that leads through this section of the Dome of

between the fluted stonework pillars that run along the eastern 
edge of the passageway. Two banners have been set before the 
door, the flags each bearing the Tree of Gondor, the symbol of 
the Steward, in golden embroidery. The River Anduin flows by at 
the base of the corridor, some twenty feet below, moving through 
the Star Dome though a great series of arches carved with amazing 
ingenuity and set in the central northern and southern sections 
of the old palace.

Rath Ostoher is Skewered by Another Street to the South~
   Several large buildings line this street. However, even 
though they are large and rather fancy, they have entered a state 
of disrepair. The stones of the buildings in several places have 
been chipped and broken, and much of the paint on the walls has 
peeled off. The broad street is paved with black and white 
cobblestones, and although they may have been perfectly aligned 
at one time, they certainly aren't now. Many have become loose 
and broken, and several are missing. The building on the west 
side of the road appears to be a store. Rath Gil intersects this 
street a small distance to the south.

Upon the Patterned Cobblestones of Rath Ostoher~
   Black and white cobblestones pave this broad street, called 
Rath Ostoher. While they are arranged in a checkered fashion on 
most of the street, in some places they have been arranged to 
form different signs and symbols. Lampposts stand at small 
intervals to give light to the street during the nighttime. A 
few benches have also been set up in the street for people to sit 
and rest. To the east, the door to what seemed to have been
a bakery has been shut and sealed with a thick, iron padlock.
This street looks like it may have looked very nice at 
one time, but now it is in need of some new paint and perhaps 
someone to repair the road.

The End of the Northern Rath Ostoher~
   This street ends a small distance to the north, after which it 
turns into Rath Turambar, which runs in an east-west direction. 
Southward, Rath Ostoher continues for quite a distance. Not much 
happens on this black and white cobblestone street. A few people 
make their way down the street, but for the most part, this broad 
street is a waste of space. Small benches have been set up along 
the sides of the street, and lamps have been hooked on tall posts 
to supply light to the street during the dark hours of the night.

Age-Old Buildings Border Rath Ostoher to the East and West~
   Rath Ostoher, named so after one of the many ancient Kings of 
Gondor, heads north and south here, the street paved with 
well-fitting cobblestones both black and white in hue. Bordering 
the street to the east and west are twin rows of double or triple 
story townhouses, the lower floor being built of solid stone and 
the upper of painted wood. Yet, despite this many of the 
residences bear signs of neglect, with broken shutters or slight 
damage visible on their outer structures. To the west, the 
entrance to a once well-appointed shop has been boarded.

Rath Ostoher Leads North and South Through Osgiliath~
   This street of Osgiliath is empty, disturbingly so; farming
produce lays rotting in the streets, as does uncollected refuse.
Lanterns and lamp posts are untended, the glass smashed. The 
buildings that line the street are either boarded up, looted, or
but a blackened stone shell. A smoky smog of soot and haze
often hangs in the air, drifting in from the east. An eerie
silence, disturbed only by the rare person to walk through, 
pervades the abandoned and ruined buildings of Osgiliath.

Rath Ostoher Changes to Another Street Southwards~
   Perhaps the most noticeable of features along the path of Rath 
Ostoher, and indeed the entire eastern section of Osgiliath, is 
the dead quiet which rules over the area throughout most of the 
day and night. Broken occasionally by the shouts of a child or 
the haggling of a merchant, for the best part the respectful 
noiselessness hangs heavy in the air. The limestone and basalt 
cobblestones of the street run past the slightly run down 
buildings. To the east stands an imposing, circular stone 
building.

Guard Tower in the City Walls of Osgiliath~
   From the vantage point given from this fortified turrent set 
in the western city wall of Osgiliath a panorama view of the 
farmland of Anorien can be observed. The River Anduin flows from 
the north-west to cut down east through the city, a light birch 
woodland nestling against its shores. This tower is lit at night 
by steel braziers that extend all along the wall, mumerous 
guardsmen wearing the royal blue of the Osgiliath garrison 
patroling up and down endlessly along the battlements. A ramp 
leads up to the city gates at the base of the tower to the south, 
while a stairwell eastwards allows progress back onto the 
streets.

Fortified Tower Overlooking the Countryside~
   This fortified tower is roughly ten feet in length and width, 
the crenulated battlements reaching up to the shoulders of a man. 
Set in the direct centre of it is a towering flag post, atop of 
it flying the regal blue and gold banner of the city of 
Osgiliath. At the base of the tower to the north a cobbled ramp 
leads up east to the gates of the city, while a short distance 
further a twin tower to this can be seen. A commanding view of 
the countryside of Anorien can be seen from atop the tower, as 
can the swiftly flowing River Anduin that cuts through the city 
from the north to south. A narrow staircase to the east leads 
down to street level.

Northwest of the City Gate~
   This street of Osgiliath is empty, disturbingly so; farming
produce lays rotting in the streets, as does uncollected refuse.
Lanterns and lamp posts are untended, the glass smashed. The 
buildings that line the street are either boarded up, looted, or
but a blackened stone shell. A smoky smog of soot and haze
often hangs in the air, drifting in from the east. An eerie
silence, disturbed only by the rare person to walk through, 
pervades the abandoned and ruined buildings of Osgiliath.

Upon the Tower Battlements North of the Gates~
   This fortified tower makes up the first of Osgiliath's eastern 
defenses, facing towards the windswept plains of Northern 
Ithilien. Crenellations run about the borders of its stone 
structure, beyond them a view of the sparsely grassed lands 
available as they run up to the base of the tower from the north 
and east. Southwards one can espy on the trail of traffic into 
and out of the city, as well as another watch tower set a short 
distance away, and glancing to the west a view of the city is 
granted, the Dome of Stars rising up in the center of the 
venerable settlement. The battlements run southwards above the 
gate housing, and a stout door is set to the north.

North of a Guard Tower on Rath Romendacil~
   A single row of lampposts runs from north to south here, 
bringing forth light during the hours of night to this section of 
Rath Romendacil. Heading parallel to the lanterns is a row of 
well constructed houses and residences, built in the townhouse 
style. The base floor is constructed from stone, whilst the 
upper levels of painted wood. Despite the elegant construction, 
cracks run through the stonework on some of the buildings and on 
others the paintwork has completely flaked off. Opposite the 
houses to the east is the city wall of Osgiliath, a watch tower 
set a short distance to the south along it. What used to be some 
sort of shop is now permanently closed, the door boarded over and 
securely locked with a thick iron padlock.

Rath Romendacil Turns West and South With the City Wall~
   Rath Romendacil, named so after one of Gondor's many kings, 
turns from south to west here, hugging close to the city wall as 
it forms its protective barrier and marks the edges of the once 
royal city of Osgiliath. Shadows are often cloaked across the 
street here due to the position of the limestone city wall to the 
north and east. A enclosed stone structure sits to the east 
along the city wall. A steep stone staircase climbs to the 
north, leading upward to the top of a crennelated watch tower 
built into the city wall.

structure~
This stone walled enclosure is quite high, almost as high as the walls of the city itself, yet the light lifting from it lets one know that it is open on the inside.  After a quick look around, the only entrance to be seen is that of a sturdy, reinforced wooden door in the front, which is guarded by a large, armour clad soldiers wearing a black cloak with the white tree.  Above the door way is a sign, and for those that inquire the guard says much the same as the sign.  "No Entry!".

Merging of Two Streets~
   Here the hexagonal-and-squared cobblestones of Rath Turambar 
join with the rounded, off-white flagstones that lead in off Rath 
Romendacil, which leads in from the east. Brass lanterns 
suspended from iron poles rise up alongside the row of houses 
that lie to the south-east, dispelling the darkness that comes 
with night by the burning of wicks and oil. The general silence 
that rules over the eastern half of Osgiliath lies heavy in the 
air here, occasional broken by a distant shout or wounded 
citizen, yet otherwise its oppressive presence is well known.

At the Base of the City Wall~
   Rath Turambar takes a sharp turn from the west to south here, 
its otherwise straight path from the west forced into a shift of 
direction by the bending limestone walls of the city boundary. 
Moss grows in abundance in the shaded cracks that run in a 
splintering fashion through the base of the stone structure, and 
a small pile of midden has been gathered in the corner created as 
the wall turns, vermin and other unsavory creatures pawing 
through it.

Rath Turambar Progresses East and West~
   Hexagonal shaped cobblestones a dull black in color make out 
the street of Rath Turambar, interspaced with smaller square 
flagstone to keep the pattern even. The street itself is rather 
narrow, wide enough to perhaps accommodate four people walking 
side by side but nothing more, the close proximity of the 
northern city wall forcing the small space between its base and 
the row of dilapidated housing to the south.

Between the Wall and Damaged Buildings on Rath Turambar~
   The wall of the city of Osgiliath rises out of the ground to 
the north. The wall reaches almost twenty feet into the air, and 
is made of large limestone blocks. The wall has not been cared 
for properly, however, and has thus attained many small cracks 
and crevasses from the wind and rain. Moss has also begun to 
grow in the cracks and across the large blocks. To the west, the 
black cobblestone street makes a bend to the south, turning into 
Rath Ostoher. On the south edge of this street, several 
buildings have been built; however, most of them are beginning to 
fall apart. A window has been broken out of one of the 
buildings, and part of the roof is missing from another. The 
street continues for a distance to the east. 
   A large gate has been set in a stone wall that runs for a 
short distance alongside south of the road, the city graveyard 
visible behind its iron bars.

   Rath Ostoher merges with Rath Turambar here. Rath Ostoher 
leads to the south, while Rath Turambar goes to the east. The 
black and white checkered cobblestones of Rath Ostoher gradually 
blend with the hexagonal shaped black cobblestones of Rath 
Turambar. A nice, well-tended park is to the west. To the north 
the wall of the city looms about twenty feet into the sky. The 
wall has been made of large blocks of sandstone, which must have 
taken ages to construct. Several cracks run through the blocks 
of sandstone, and small patches of moss grow in those cracks and 
between the blocks.

South of an Intersection on Rath Romendacil~
   A wide set of stone steps rise up at the eastern edge of this 
street, leading up to a watch tower set upon the battlements of 
the walls of Osgiliath. Guardsmen are abound in noticeable 
numbers, visible walking along upon the limestone wall or 
patrolling either up and down Rath Romendacil. Few civilians can 
be seen, yet those that do walk along the road are clothed in 
finer dyes and cuts then one would expect to see on an average 
commoner. To the north, the street expands as it approaches an 
intersection before the gates of the city, whilst southward it 
narrows considerably. Westwards lies the remenants of a building,
now collapsed into random fragments of burnt timber.

Cobblestones Alongside the City Wall~
   To the north and the south the street of Rath Romendacil runs 
through the city Osgiliath, once the home of the kings of Gondor 
but now faded in comparison to its past glory. Circular 
cobblestones pave the street, yet a number are missing, with 
thick brown dirt covering the street up against the city wall to 
the east. Townhouses, built with the lower section made from 
stone upper stories of wood, loom over the narrow street to the 
west, many of them dusty and with paint flaking off. 
   Stone steps to the east lead upward onto a crennelated watch 
tower built into the city wall.

   This twisting section of Rath Romendacil faithfully follows 
the southern wall of the city as it turns from the west to the 
north here. White cobblestones that are rounded in shape fill 
the small space between the multiple-story houses to the north 
and the blocks of limestone opposite them, the occasional 
cast-iron lamppost rising out from between two of the flagstones. 
Dirt and grime are found in small qualities here, their presence 
not overly surprising in the poorer section of eastern Osgiliath.

Turn South to East in the Wall~
   Few people move through this somewhat desolate section of the 
eastern section of the city of Osgiliath, their footfalls upon 
the small, rounded paving stones echoing softly against the bulk 
of the southern city wall that lies to the south-east. As Rath 
Romendacil ends to the south, running into Rath Atanatar, the 
tall buildings of the city look down upon the narrow road, 
shading the area from the light of the sun during most parts of 
the day.

Rath Atanatar Meets Another Street Northwards~
   From the north to west the road bends on a sharp angle, its 
passage directed by the city wall which turns to the south-east, 
armoured guardsmen patrolling endlessly along its battlements. 
Rath Atanatar's dull, grey, cobblestones lead out to the west, 
cut into squares and brown dirt wedged into the gaps, whilst as 
the street progresses northwards the flagstones take on an 
off-white, roundish form. Well-built yet poorly maintained 
houses line the street opposite the wall, and only on the rare 
occasion is the oppressive silence of this section of Rath 
Atanatar broken.

Rath Atanatar at a Junction~
   The street of Rath Atanatar is named so after the tenth king 
of Gondor's royal line, which now lies sadly diminished. Much 
the same as the name it bears, the road has a slightly decrepit 
feel to it, the grey cobblestone path narrow as it runs between 
the southern city wall and a row of multiple story houses fallen 
into disrepair. East and west the road leads, yet few move along 
it, those that do being dressed in clothing a cut above the 
average peasant garb. A small pile of midden has gathered 
against the white stoned wall, undisturbed by any save the 
occasional vermin.

Rath Atanatar Between Two Junctions~
   Bordering the northern edge of Rath Atanatar's slate-grey 
flagstones is a row of ancient townhouses, the street being one 
of the poorer sections of eastern Osgiliath. Yet, despite the 
obvious age and lack of maintenance given to the residences, they 
still survive, owing to the fact that they seem to have 
originally been built of firm materials and expert architecture, 
many of them two or more stories and with large, stone 
foundations. Opposing the housing of the city is the southern 
city wall, small cracks caused by time running throughout the 
limestone structure. Directly to the east and west are two 
separate junctions, though Rath Atanatar continues its path along 
the southern city wall.

UNUSED Junction of Rath Ostoher and Rath Atanatar~
   From the north, the quiet street of Rath Ostoher flows into 
this junction with a progression of black and white chequered 
cobblestones, turning to the eastern stretching, slate grey 
flagstones of Rath Atanatar. As the two roads meet, the low 
limestone wall of a tiled courtyard to the south halts any 
further progress in that direction. Rusted yet still functioning 
street lamps are situated every few yards, bringing light to this 
junction once the sun sets on the city of Osgiliath.

UNUSED Rath Atanatar Through Twin Rows of Maple Trees~
   Many maple trees line the sides of this quiet street. The 
long, old limbs of the trees have grown and woven themselves into 
the limbs of the trees on either side of them, forming two long 
green walls of maples. To the east, this street is joined by 
Rath Ostoher, which comes from the north. A fairly large plaza 
is down the street to the west. Old lanterns hanging from wooden 
posts have been placed every so often along the sides of the 
street, although some of the lampposts have been partially hidden 
by the large, overgrown maple trees. 
   A small building stands to the north, its glass-paned windows 
set about with brightly-colored bottles. To the south, a 
fenced-in courtyard lies, with a narrow gap between the fence and 
the next building.

UNUSED Shaded Plaza at the End of Rath Atanatar~
   This fairly large plaza is shaded from the rays of the sun by 
the row of maple trees that encircle it. Despite being a large 
and rather beautiful place, it has not been maintained as well as 
it should have been, and has been somewhat deteriorated. Several 
large potholes have appeared in the plaza. As with the street to 
the east, several lampposts have been set up in the plaza. A 
lamppost has been placed in between each maple tree in the 
circle, as well as several others in a symmetrical fashion. 
   A large, ornate building occupies the northern end of the 
plaza, a row of flags set before its large doors. A large, 
two-story warehouse with windows set high in its walls dominates 
the southern edge of the plaza. A small gap between it and 
another building allows access to the alleyways behind it. A 
small, dirt path snakes between buildings in the northwestern 
corner. 
  A cobbled pathway leads westward, away from the plaza, and
to a two-story wooden building to the northwest.

Lush Parkland~
   This plot of land has been set aside from the usual 
development of an urban level, and instead a lush, tended garden 
has been planted, the tree and bushes of varying species and 
neatly kept throughout the year. The fresh scent of flowers 
hangs sweetly in the air, and the occasional squirrel or other 
small mammals can be spotted scurrying about the grassy ground. 
A thin path made of rough-shod stones leads from east back onto 
the main streets of Osgiliath, to further west in the park.

Crenellated Tower Overlooking Northern Ithilien~
   Set in the eastern walls of Osgiliath, this watchtower 
provides a sweeping view of the barren, wind-blasted terrain of 
Northern Ithilien. Peasant villages and farming homesteads are 
visible in the distance, as well as a long road stretching out to 
a distant range of mountains visible upon the horizon. A solid 
iron pole rises up from the centre of the platform here, a large 
banner hoisted upon it. Displayed upon its dark blue linen in 
thick golden thread is the Tree of Gondor, seven stars placed 
about it.

Lush Parkland Beside a Shrouded Pool~
   Drooping willow trees let loose their slender branches over 
the soft grass of this parkland, the branches of several birches 
intertwining to form a natural canopy over a small, shallow pool 
set in the centre of this area. A small stone path, paved with 
irregular, grey stones leads up from the east to the beginning of 
the pool before ending at its cool waters. Past the flora to the 
north the limestone city wall can be seen, branching vines 
running up its surface and mold growing in the cracks between the 
large blocks. To the west a smaller wall rises up, also bounded 
by branches and vines.

Winding Path Through Tents and Stalls~
   The lively market is bordered in here to a wooden fence and 
cedar tavern wall that lay to the north and east respectively. 
Despite these restrictions, the trade still seems to progress in 
earnest, with hawkers, merchants, stall vendors and more offering 
wares for sale. There is a distinct rural atmosphere to the area 
here, acting little more then a path through the various sellers, 
with most of the products for sale being agricultural in nature, 
farm tools, grain, livestock, poultry, dairy products and more 
being the primary wares for sale.

Farmer's Market~
   Iron lampposts periodically rise up from the basalt and 
limestone cobblestones of this market square, illuminating the 
area of business long after the sun's rays have departed for the 
day. Composed of a vast multitude of noises and smells, a 
fluxing number of merchants with varying wares attempt to make a 
sale here at the numerous citizens of Osgiliath that pass 
through. Tents and stalls signal a few of the more permanent 
traders, many simply holding their goods for sale and advertising 
loudly to the area around them at general.

Lively Market Stalls~
   Citizens of the decrepit city of Osgiliath wander about the 
bustling market situated in this cobbled city square, browsing 
through the goods offered by the various the assorted merchants, 
hawkers and hucksters that have set up stalls and small tents 
here. A gala of colour, sights and smells is presented to those 
that stray in the thick of business, compounded with the cries of 
promotion that echo off against the paving stones. To the west a 
city street runs past the market, few if any people travelling 
across it, the near deserted facet of Osgiliath present only a 
few feet away from this area of concentrated activity. 
   A colorful display of glass bottles is arranged in the shop
window to the south.

Antiques of Osgiliath~
   Regal blue paint has at one stage been applied to the plaster 
walls of this small storefront, now bits and pieces flake off 
everywhere as a large crack is the eastern wall allows one to 
glance at the wooden frame that the paint and plaster are built 
upon. Perhaps half a dozen each of sets of shelves and benches 
display all sorts of second hand goods and scavenged junk, yet 
one or two items of any worth for purchase can be seen about the 
shop. A solid oak door held securely on by a pair of bronze 
hinges opens out to the street, set in the north wall. Another 
door to the south leads to the alleys of Osgiliath.

   Shifting treacherously underfoot here is a loose collection of 
rubble and waste. Composed mostly of broken blocks of limestone 
in all shapes and sizes, fragments of wooden beams, pieces of 
pottery and shards of glass all feature throughout, an edged 
hazard to the bare feet. Soot and ash have fallen in the deeper 
cracks of the mound, rising perhaps half a dozen feet above the 
level of a narrow dirt trail that leads up to it from the west. 
The walls of a whitewashed building border against the mound to

aroma clinging to the white-washed walls of the storefront. Four 
large tables have been placed about the floor, at which a few 
patrons hold lazy, hushed conversations and partake of lit pipes 
and rolls of Westmansweed. Through the western door comes the 
sound of traffic along the Rath Earendil. A second door sits in 
the eastern wall, behind a stained pine counter marred with tiny 
scorch marks and grimy resin.

piles of crates, sacks, chests, bundles and packages, porters 
moving in and out of the wide doors to the south at various 
times. taking and depositing cargo. A number of lanterns hang 
from the rooftop beam, casting light down onto the floor, their 
task aided during the hours of day by a series of wide shutters 
set above the southern door. A narrow staircase rises up along 
the eastern wall, ending at a thin wooden door.

captains can be found here at all times of night and day eager to 
announce their cargo and be on their business. A number of

stone for sale, and the air always smells just a little of stone 
and dust. The walls are of skillfully set masonry, though, and 
though spartan, the place is clean and tidy. A solid wooden door 
set in the west wall provides an exit from the shopfront, while a

move about the stone floor of the room, examining the wine and 
other alcoholic beverages placed within the store, and a counter 
running across the room from north to south.

Madam Lucia's Clothing and Accessories~
   Hangings and embroideries festoon the white plaster walls of 
this expensive, dainty shop. Racks, shelves and even mannequins 
display fine clothing designed for wear and use by men, as well 
as other sewn goods of all sorts and shapes. Dominating the 
centre of the room is a large, oak counter, rather old yet its 
wood polished to a high sheen. Several large windows have been 
set beside the eastern doorway, allowing light to enter the area. 
As well as the natural sunlight provided by the windows, an 
ancient candelabra hangs from the ceiling in order to illuminate 
all areas of the room.

Madam Lucia's Clothing and Accessories~
   Dresses, blouses, skirts and chemises of all shapes, sizes and 
styles can be seen throughout this room, some neatly folded upon 
racks, hanging on mannequins, and set out from the walls. The 
room itself is of a substantial size and a line of fitting rooms 
set at the western, blocked out by a thick, red curtain. A 
single, plain iron candelabra hangs from the ceiling, the blazing 
candles lighting the entire area, whilst a pair of glass windows 
set in the east wall look out onto the street. An archway set in 
the southern wall leads to the entrance of the store.

Stone Landing at the Base of a Stone Stairwell~
   This wide, sparsely furnished room serves as the lower landing 
for a marble-built yet simple staircase, its broad steps 
ascending upward from the northern edge of the area. Despite the 
brief contents that this stone walled chamber contains, it is far 
from derelict, instead appearing neat and spartan. The only 
ornamentation spans most of the east wall in the form of a large 
banner, resplendent regal blue in colour and bearing the Tree of 
Gondor upon it in goldenrod. 
   A pair of richly hued oak doors facilitates exit to the south, 
whilst a broad arch is set in the western wall.

Passageway Through the Second Floor of the Star Dome~
   Spanning a short distance from east to west, the regular stone 
walls and floor of this passageway remain free from any 
tapestries or rugs, save a line of torch scones that run along 
the northern edge of the corridor. Easily wide enough for 
numerous soldiers to march through, a number of armoured men do 
patrol through this area. The sounds of conversation drift in 
from a dark oak door fitted well to the south stone wall, while 
an arch to the east leads out to a landing of a staircase.

Stone Corridors Leading Away From a Set of Doors to the West~
   A junction of three corridors is formed here as the separate 
passages lead in from the north, east and south. The area has 
been enlarged slightly to receive the trio of paths that flow 
into it, and the eastern corners have been filled with a pair of 
nurtured pot plants. Men garbed as guardsmen of Osgiliath pass 
through this room on various tasks, whether patrol or personal, 
and a constant background noise of footsteps and conversation 
echoes throughout the junction. A large pair of ornate doors is 
set in the western wall.

Balcony Overlooking the Lower Floors of the Star Dome~
   Set a storey above the normal walkways of the Dome of Stars, 
the ancient structure that once served as palace to the Kings of 
Gondor, a stirring view of the magnificent architecture is 
viewable from this balcony. The gigantic, curved roof and 
mile-long Bridge of Osgiliath stand testament to the engineering 
ability of the Numenoreans of old. Constructed entirely from 
marble, both platform and rails, a chill breeze often drifts 
through the area, originating from the dark blue stretch of the 
River Anduin as it carves its way through the city. To the west 
the other edge of the Star Dome can be seen, while to the east a 
pair of richly toned oak doors rests.

Stone Passageway~
   Stone walls and floor lead in the directions of north and 
south, the white rock cut into regular blocks and without 
adornment. A slight trickle of people, dressed in both simple 
clothing and guardsmen uniform, make their way to and from the 
exits of this area, conversations carrying on throughout the 
hallway. Being slightly cool during the hours of night, light is 
provided from a pair of sconces set either side of a window cut 
in the western wall. A solid door has been fitted to the east 
wall, allowing entrance into a much noisier and warmer area.

Narrow Passageway West of Cooking Smells~
   This passageway comes to an abrupt halt to the south, ending 
at a solid, stone wall that offers no compromises. Northwards, 
an uncarpeted floor leads its way through the barracks of the 
Osgiliath guard garrison, a few members of the organisation 
making their patrols through the corridor. Vague sounds echo 
throughout the area, the jingle of armour combined with the 
general noises of a place inhabited by a large number of men. To 
the east the smells of cookery filter through an oak door.

   Pale light streams into the room from an arched window carved 
from the beige stone of the western wall, yet this meagre 
brightness is supplemented by a pair of torches set in iron 
brackets that reside either side of the graceful window. The 
flickering torchlight is constantly trodden through by the 
numerous men and women of the Osgiliath guard, making their way 
to and from their barracks behind the door to the east and 
further north along the corridor to other locations situated 
within the garrison.

Northern Wing of Guard Barracks in the Star Dome~
   Simple pieces of square limestone have been used in the 
construction of this passageway, the entirety of the guard 
garrison built in the same manner. Two torches burn brightly 
from their position on the east wall, and when one burns out it 
is quickly replaced by one of the members of the Osgiliath Guard 
that constantly stroll the hallway. The booted footsteps of 
passer-by's echoes throughout the stone chamber, the leather of 
the soles striking against the uncovered floor. To the south the 
corridor leads on, ending a to the north, and a wooden door is 
set in the eastern wall.

Spacious Barracks~
   Despite the stone walls, floor and ceiling, this room is far 
from cold and remote, warmed by the constant presence of human 
bodies. Whether sleeping, waking, conversing softly or dressing 
for duty, these barracks are never truly still and empty, with 
watches of the Osgiliath Guard running both night and day. The 
sleeping quarters of the garrison is furnished only with perhaps 
a score of bunkbeds that run down the rectangular room in a trio 
of rows, all battered yet still serviceable. To the south a 
green curtain covers an arch while to the west a door leads out 
of the barracks.

Bunkbed Lined Barracks~
   This room is rather wide, stretching far enough to accommodate 
the multitude of bunkbeds that have been arranged in three 
straight rows. Each bed consists of a simple straw mattress and 
a rough yet warm woollen blanket, and each bed is kept neat and 
orderely in a military fashion. These quarters are designated 
for unmarried members of the Osgiliath Guard, and a number of 
figures dozing and sleeping are present in these barracks at all 
times of the day. A green curtain covers a passage north, while 
a secure oak door facilitates movement to the west.

Aromatic Kitchen~
   Though this kitchen is small, it is filled with activity at 
all times of night and time. Bread must be baked to feed the 
mouths of the Osgiliath guard garrison, and the oven is tended no 
matter what hour of the day or night by the cook or an assistant 
in the kitchen. The smell of roasting meat occasionally wafts 
through the air, and vegetables can be seen laid about the 
numerous benches that ring around the area. Only the occasional 
guardsman wanders through this area, entering from either of the 
two small oak doors set in the northern and western walls of the 
room.

Large Messhall~
   Crowded yet congenial during the meal times of the day and 
evening, occupied with a light gathering of men and women at 
other times, this messhall is constantly filled with a warm and 
friendly atmosphere. The white walls of stone are not set too 
far apart, thus adding to the close-set nature of the room, and 
the floor space is primarily occupied by four rectangular tables, 
long, simple benches set either side of them. A small hearth set 
in the eastern wall of the room provides warmth during the colder 
months of the year, and three oak doors led off in the other 
directions, the two smaller to the south and west, while the 
large set of doors rests in the north wall.

Landing at the Top of a Stone Stairwell~
   From the south side of this room, a broad, marble staircase 
leads straight down to a lower floor of the garrison. Laid upon 
the smooth stone floor of the landing here is a large blue rug, 
its fibers worn by the constant tread of feet, yet the Tree of 
Gondor, tree and seven stars, still visible in pale-gold. No 
windows rest upon the walls of this area, light instead provided 
by torch scones set in small alcoves. Well-disciplined guardsmen 
march in and out of the area, leaving either via the stairs or 
the arch that leads westwards from the room.

Well Adorned Hallway~
   Even though the worn stone floor of this hallway is bare, the 
walls bear many ancient and pitted weapons of yore, suspended on 
metal hooks, as well as other relics of long gone battles. 
Tattered standards and fragile horns peer down upon the men and 
women of the Osgiliath Guard as they move along the corridor, 
their heavy boots sounding up and down the walls. Bright torches 
illuminate the area, warding off the shadows of darkness, 
casting light upon the two doors set opposite each other to the 
north and south. The other exits from this room lie to the east 
and west.

made from wood, which is starting to decay. Well-oiled but clearly
ancient swords, ranging from unadorned shortswords to elaborately-
inlaid greatswords more than six feet in length, have been set
upon the southern wall, held up by stout iron hooks. A single
polearm, the wooden shaft dyed blue, and the crescent-shaped
blades badly pitted, has been mounted next to the door set in the
southern wall.

   The first thing that one notices in this room is the near 
overpowering smell of oil. Hardened leather suits of armour rest 
on racks bear the aroma, blades of all sorts lay wrapped in oil
soaked rags as do the array of mail suits displayed along the 
rear wall. Spacious and well ordered, the armoury bears enough
arms and armour to outfit an army. Pike and halberds lay leaned
against tall racks that in turn bear axes and maces, everything 
kept in impeccable condition. A small, shielded lantern casts a 
slight light onto the room, whilst a sturdy oak door lies south.

   A slight step down from the dark door set in the northern wall 
is required to enter the wooden floor of the training hall, and 
clean straw has been liberally spread about the area. Contained 
in the room is all manners of devices used by the Osgiliath 
Guards to hone their skills of not only keeping the peace, but to 
wage war. Archery butts, straw dummies, sparring rings, ropes 
and more have been placed about the room, and at all times during 
the day men and women can be seen making use of the facilities. 
The roof is high, a series of lanterns suspended from it that 
brighten the room to easily accomodate for near any eye.

Junction of Hallways~
   From the east, a second corridor leads into the first that 
heads from north to south at this junction here. Clinking with 
the sounds of mail and metal, members of the Osgiliath City Watch 
pass through here on their daily duties and tasks, some stopping 
to converse or salute senior officers. The clangs and thuds of 
training drift in from the east, and an occasional injured 
soldier can be seen making their way from that direction to the 
north. To the west a set of double-doors lie, a series of 
shields decorated with various heralds arranged atop of it.

oak and rather sturdy, block passage to the north and east, while 
to the south a junction can be seen. The northern door is topped 
by a blue shield painted with a golden star.

pallets can be seen stacked in one corner of the room. The light 
provided from the ceiling-hung lanterns here is dim, yet enough 
for the medics to work by. Occasionally guardsmen passes through 
the infirmary to see to small injuries, other times soldiers are 
carried here for more serious treatment.

with a thick woolen blanket, stretch down alongside the length of

Northwestern Bank of the Morgulduin~
   The pale waters of Morgulduin run to the west and north as the 
river rounds a slight bend, lapping against the rocky shore. The 
bank of the river is barren mostly and in places broken with dirt 
and rocks falling into the water. Shrubs and grasses grow but 
only barely and mostly remain far from the waters edge. The 
sounds of the wind, the occasional bird and the water are the 
only ones that intrude upon this place.

UNUSED Desolate Sitting Room~
   Though apparently still in use by the lack of dust between the 
several chipped marble benches and the archway in the eastern 
limestone wall, this room bears a great deal of damage upon its 
walls, floor and ceiling. The wide tiles of alternating black 
and white stone that run underfoot here show a number missing, 
packed dirt set in the gaps, and the pitted walls look far from 
their finest. Circular in shape, stone holdings for flower beds 
and other plants ring around the length of the room, containing 
only dry soil. Empty torch sconces span out at head height from 
the walls, yet some light enters the room from the east. 
   An archway to the east leads out of the room, to a corridor 
that runs along the Anduin's edge.

Barren Hills Below the Ephel Duath~
   The land here is slightly cracked and broken the lack of 
moisture in the ground causing the landscape to crumble slightly. 
Grass grows here and small green and brown shrubs manage to find 
a place to grow. Trees can rarely be seen being few and far 
between, hidden by the rise and fall of the hills, despite this 
the occasionally tree does appear. 
   An odd formation of rocks juts slightly from the ground, 
rising from the hills.

The Common Room~
  The spacious common room is almost always busy, providing a 
comfortable place for the soldiers to rest when they are not on 
duty. People regularly pass through on various errands. Chairs 
and padded benches stand around the room, and plain brown rugs 
cover much of the gray flagstone floor. A fireplace on the 
western wall offers light and warmth when neccessary. 
   Wooden doors lead north, west, and east; the one beside the 
fireplace seems especially worn. A staircase leads up to the 
second floor, while a short wide corridor opens up to the north.

Jailhouse Foyer~
   The foyer of the jailhouse of Osgiliath is circular in shape; 
the roof set a moderate distance overhead large slabs of white 
and black stone run underfoot. Built for the purpose of 
processing the sentences and charges of criminals for minor 
matters, the occasional argument between a guardsman and captured 
lawbreaker can be seen on the floor of the foyer. Lanterns 
placed in the walls cast light throughout the room in both night 
and day, and also set on the walls are a number of banners from 
ancient battles, each bearing the blue and gold of the Osgiliath 
guard. A set of double-doors lies to the west, while a single, 
iron-bound door is set in the eastern wall.

Top of a Stairwell~
   A pair of lanterns cast oil-wrought light over the area before 
the wide stone stairwell as it leads down to the cells of the 
Star Dome's prison. The faint sounds of men and women calling 
out for food, the rattle of keys and the slamming of doors drifts 
up from below, almost background noise in this otherwise 
noiseless chamber. A stout oak door set in the western stone 
wall leads out to the foyer of the jailhouse, but otherwise there 
are no other exits save the staircase.

Among the Cells at the Bottom of a Stairwell~
   This confined chamber has been cut from the stonework of the
structure of the Dome of Stars, with irregular stone walls and
floor. Dank and chill run through the area, moss and mould
gathering in corners and between the cracks of the stone used to
construct the passageway. Numerous doors lead off from here,
each of stout oak and bound with iron bars, a heavy lock set in
each one, and from behind them comes the occasional noise of
movement. Burning lanterns illuminate the room, set about the
wide stairwell set in the centre of the chamber. At the base
of the stairs, to one side, is an iron-banded trapdoor.

all sorts of multicolored jars and long-necked bottles; the only 
exits out of the room are by a descending narrow spiral staircase 
or through a wide door set in the northern wall. Several dozen 
enormous candles are evenly arranged around the room, providing 
even, and very bright lighting for the windowless room.

   The stone bricks of this short hallway seem to have a downward 
slope as they lead deeper into what appears to be a tomb. Old, 
deteriorating statues line either side of the hallway, and a 
number of moldings and murals are etched into the walls. Many of 
the murals have long since faded, but some depict great battles 
outside of Minas Ithil in the days before it became Minas Morgul. 
Bones of unknown origin are scattered across the ground, turned 
dry and brittle over time. The passage continues to the south 
while a large slab of stone can conceal the exit to the north.

carved with hideous faces that stare malignantly upon any who 
enter. A faint smell of acrid decay also lingers here, and an 
endless dripping sound rings out from some dark corner. The only 
way in or out of this crypt is a stone passageway to the north.

polished to a sheen that reflects the light of the lamps set
here and there to augment the windows.

   This narrow strip of land runs along the side of the house,
between it and the fence separating it from the next-door
house's garden. Shrubs and trees obscure most of the fence,
though trees can be seen poking up behind the fence in other
lots. A door leads south into the house itself.

Berendel's Warehouse~
   Stacked full of barrels, crates and boxes this warehouse has a 
rather chaotic appearance. A long wooden counter runs the length 
of the southern wall behind which the staff work. They are 
constantly moving up and down the counter attending to patrons. 
Sometimes climbing the ladders and racking that line the walls to 
get to the stock stored above easy reach. Long lengths of timber 
and whole tree logs have been hoisted up and layed across the 
rafters of the building. In the western wall of the building is 
a large set of double doors behind which the sound of a saw-mill 
can be heard.

Small Shack in a Tree~
   This small shack is shabbily constructed from rough hardwood 
planks and large unfinished pieces of timber. The floor is 
somewhat uneven, with many of the floorboards slightly disjoined, 
and sticking up at irregular angles, but it is very sturdy and 
immobile, having been secured to the thick branches of the oak 
tree with thick, strong hemp rope. The walls and roof aren't 
well constructed, as they barely keep out the weather; the 
various holes, though, allow someone to easily fire missile 
weapons at anyone lingering beneath the tree. A rope ladder 
could be lowered onto the ground below.

to the main part of the house, with plenty of room for furniture and
shelves. The wood-panelled walls are covered with fancy pelts and
old, embroidered and painted hangings, giving the room a picturesque
and rustic appearance. The tile floor is scrupulously clean, and the
furniture is well-tended. Windows let in light here and there, but
they are all barred.
   Doors are set to the east, leading out of the house, and to the south
and north. A staircase leads up to a loft.

Twisted Path~
   Twisting a crooked course through scattered piles of refuse 
and fallen masonry and timber, this path more closely resembles 
an alley than a true street as it leads through the abandoned 
slums of western Osgiliath. The tattered and ramshackle homes 
and warehouses that lay either side of the dirt-street are 
uninhabited, flaking paint and rotting wood a testament to the 
lack of life in this area. A huge building, once constructed of 
stone, now resides only as a mound of rubble to the north, the 
path skirting about it, while the building to the south is being 
refurbished and rebuilt, a number of masons continually working 
on it day in and day out.

'Osgiliath's Golden Cat Tavern'~
   Entrance and exit to this partially restored warehouse is 
granted through a wide, iron-banded door that was built right 
into the now nailed-shut double-doors that take up a sizeable 
portion of the northern wall. The floor is stained and scratched 
but reasonably clear, though a few ale-spills and scattered 
westmansweed ashes could use cleaning up. Rats and cockroaches 
can be seen occasionally, scurrying about beneath the bar and in 
the shadows of the empty, abandoned room.

A Narrow Hallway~
   Movement about the second story of this refurbished warehouse 
brings a gentle creaking of wood, though the recently-replaced 
pale cedar timbers of the floor give credit to the masons who 
rebuilt this building. Doors line the hallway to the west, 
south, and east, and at the end of the hall to the north lies a 
staircase for access to the ground floor of the building. A 
small amount of noise frequently filters in from below, as do the 
smells of food, ale, and especially Westmansweed.

Warehouse Roof~
   Atop the once-prosperous refurbished warehouse, the roof is 
almost entirely new cedar timbers, pale and unstained. The 
rooftop is recently cleaned, though a few small fragments of 
pottery and cloth lie strewn about the area. Though the height 
of the roof is quite great, the one redemption this offers is the 
glorious view granted of the Dome of Stars, the old palace of 
Osgiliath, to the east. Dominating the skyline, its off-white 
structure contrasts with the bleak greys and browns of the poorer 
quarter of the city. A metal ladder in the northeast corner of 
the roof leads down to inside the building, while to the south a 
long drop leads swiftly to the unyeilding ground below.

Upon a Filthy, Stone Warehouse Wall~
   Moss grows abundantly about the southwards facing stone wall 
of the warehouse. The wooden structures added about it suggest 
that the rotted timbers of the building are a more recent 
construction than the original rock. Still, its grainy surface 
has been subject to many a harsh storm, and numerous handholds 
for the brave exist to try to scale the wall. Two stories in 
height, the occasional bird's nest nestled in the cracks and 
crevices of the shifting masonry by those moving up or down the 
surface wall. Downwards lies the hard, flat packed earth of a 
backlot.

Backlot Before a Squat Stone Structure~
   Though it seems to be clean enough, this small, rectangular 
lot between buildings reeks of an utterly foul stench that never 
fails to assail the human nose. The northern and southern sides 
of the backlot are bordered by a variety of buildings, from 
small, wooden homes to three-story stone warehouses, though all 
of them seem to be mere shadows of their former glory. A white 
stone structure cuts off passage to the north, an iron-banded 
door set into its wall. The lot continues westward.

Fence-Bordered Backlot~
   This area was once perhaps the back lot of a thriving 
business, and the stone building to which it once belonged lies 
off to the east. The ground here is dirty and foul-smelling, and 
the occasional piece of fallen stone or broken timber can be seen 
littered around the weedy, vine-choked ground here. Numerous 
rodents and other alley life skitter and scamper along the ground 
at sight of a human presence. A recently crafted pale cedar 
fence borders the lot to the north, south, and west, and from 
these directions, the slight sounds of the city drift in.

Alleyway Entrance~
   There is little difference between the entrance of this alley 
and the street of Western Osgiliath to the east. Perhaps once a 
noble road itself, now this dirt path winds its way through the 
derelict buildings of the city slums, structures long vacated of 
any human residence, now occupied by bats, vermin, spiders and 
dust. No citizens of the once-fair city can be seen passing 
through here, and the alley splits at the stone wall of an 
ancient stone storehouse to run west and south.

Narrow Gap Between Buildings~
   It is a slight squeeze for larger specimens of the human race 
to move through this area, the alley here being little more than 
a gap between two rows of equally abandoned buildings. The dirt 
path, leading east and west, is made even more precarious by the 
debris littered across it, the obstacles made up of fallen 
timbers to refuse and street-animal corpses. Despite the 
neglect, many of the houses have survived, due to the lower floor 
being constructed of stone, a reminder of the lost prosperity of 
the city.

Backlot of Abandoned Buildings~
   To the north, east and west a number of dilapidated buildings 
turn their backs to this section of the alleys that crisscross 
the slums of Western Osgiliath, forming a small back lot. 
Boarded windows and doorframes clearly mark the absence of human 
inhabitation for this area, save one building to the north. 
Ancient garbage litters the area, present in all shapes and 
forms, broken glass and pottery here and there, a large pile of 
wooden remains nestled in a corner. To the south, a wide passage 
leads out of this area, while a narrow gap sits eastwards.

Junction of Two Alleyways~
   Two pathways through the ramshackle and non-maintained housing 
of the city form a junction here, its packed-dirt street trod by 
none save the swarm of rats and other alley life that thrives in 
this area. The directions of north, east and west all lead 
through the dark buildings, the twin stories of the houses 
casting an early shadow over the refuse-cluttered streets early 
and late during the day, at night a pitch darkness falling in its 
place. A decrepit house borders the alleyway to the south.

Alley Before a Stone Building~
   A large, secure building fashioned from grainy, white stone 
borders the northern side of the alleyway here, its small windows 
covered over with planks of wood. Moss grows freely along the 
lower ranges of its stone structure, and fungi extending to make 
parts of the rough-shod path of dirt here slippery to those 
careless of foot. The alley makes a crooked, twisted path to 
both the east and west, past more derelict and abandoned houses.

   The alleyway makes a sharp turn from north to west here, its 
path forced so by a large shipment of now rotted lumber never 
collected by its distant owner. A thick layer of dirt serves as 
the means with which to make progress along this narrow road, but 
still some fragments of the original cobbles stick at odd angles. 
Ramshackle huts built from scrap material and the gutted remains 
of once grand town-houses line the street either side, empty 
shells holding nothing of any value to anyone.

Rubble-Strewn Alleyway Entrance~
   Rubble tangled with the rampant growth of vines clutters the 
western edge of this entrance to the alleys of the city, the 
remnants of a elegant building now ruins in the streets of 
Osgiliath, a sad reminder of the cities hallowed past. With the 
collapse of the stone structure, progress can be made to and from 
the street of Rath Earnil to the west and the dark alley that 
runs eastward, the dirt path trodden by no civilians of 
Osgiliath.

Moist, Mossy Basement~
   Fungi, moss and mould cover much of the floor on the eastern 
half of this basement, a pool of putrid and stagnant water form 
and oozing from cracks in the stone wall. The rest of the room 
is bare, save for the domain of dust and cobwebs formed intricate 
patterns about the other half of the room. The air is cool and 
damp in the basement under the warehouse, still and lifeless, yet 
a slight wind sometimes creeps through the trapdoor at the 
southern end of the area. A large hole has been knocked out in 
the northern most stone wall, the darkness uninviting. A large 
hole has been knocked into the southern wall, as well.

Narrow, Smooth-Walled Tunnel~
   This narrow tunnel that leads downard slightly to the north is 
not formed from the earth, rather, a long, straight stone passage 
of ancient architecture, especially so when compared to the more 
recent stone walls constructed at the south of the tunnel. Old, 
runic writing, slightly similar to the Numenian-Tengwar script 
employed today in Gondor, is barely visible along the eastern 
wall of the tunnel, running a short distance at about waist 
height to a man. To the south, a stone wall has had a hole 
bashed through it, leading out of the tunnel, while to the north 
the passage leads into a larger chamber. There is only enough 
for single-file travel down this passage, and all but the 
smallest of men are forced to bend over somewhat to progress 
through here.

Collapsed Chamber~
   Smooth, stone walls, built with flawless labour, form this 
once circular chamber. Now, however, the northern half of the 
room is blocked by collapsed masonry, looking to have come from 
the ceiling. Smaller pieces of stone chipped and scarred by 
whatever ordeal fell the roof so many years ago. A large, 
circular door constructed from iron and impossibly heavy lies in 
the floor, amidst the rubble. Spiderwebs and dust bunnies 
inhabit this area now, as well as the occasional vermin. A 
tunnel stretches out to the south, leading out from where the 
door's large hinges rest in the wall. Another iron door, this 
one still attached to the wall, lies to the west.

Short, Narrow Tunnel~
   The eastern side of this tunnel is built from expert masonry, 
yet is leads only a short way before succumbing in a heap of 
fallen rubble. Yet someone has taken pains and efforts to move 
stone, and a newly dug earthen tunnel leads on westwards from 
that point. The passage holds room enough for only a few people, 
and the centre of the path is free of cobwebs and dust which is 
more than can be said about the low roof and edges. A colossus 
iron door sits at the eastern end of the tunnel, yet an intricate 
series of hinges and pulleys allows it to be opened easily. To 
the west, the tunnel enters a hole knocked through a stone wall.

Basement Barracks~
   Underneath the stone floor of the building above, this 
basement has been converted into a barracks of sort. A dozen 
bunkbeds of varying quality and stability have been set up on the 
grainy, white stone floor of the large basement. Oil lamps have 
been suspended from the roof, and a small area has been cleared 
for a campfire to warm the room at night. Crates, chests, 
wardrobes and racks have been scavenged to serve as containers 
for personal items, stored haphazardly about the area. The 
eastern wall is marred by a large hole, big enough for a man to 
squeeze through, and a wooden staircase leads upward to a 
trapdoor.

Crowded Storehouse~
   Kept in livable, yet poor conditions, this room encompasses 
nearly all of the first floor of the building. Save for a small 
room set in the northwest corner of the area, it seems that the 
living of numerous people is carried out in this space. A small 
kitchen area has been organized in the southeast corner, the 
smells of simple yet filling cooking occasionally emerging from 
there. Simple, wood-framed windows line the western wall, 
relatively clean, yet in ill-repair. Southwards, a stout, oak 
door reinforced with iron bands covers a doorway, a heavy bar 
resting across it. A trap door located in the northeast corner 
leads down to the basement of this building.

Cramped Office~
   With barely enough space for its furniture, this room is 
rather cramped and chilly, the stone walls providing little 
warmth. A tall pewter candlestick lights the room, wax runnings 
built up about the base of the candle. A secure oak door with a 
small, intricate lock allows access out of the room to the east, 
and from that direction the sounds of people can be heard.

cavernous hall, lit from above by a number of hanging lanterns. 
The walls are plain and mostly bare. Several long tables have 
been arranged in the western half of the room, while the southern 
half has been converted into a kitchen and sitting-room. Doors 
have been set in the western and northern walls of the area, 
while a shadowy arch leads to the east.

building. This room is rather small, only large enough to hold 
within it a few people, the walls unadorned except for a 
lantern-sconce that covers the area in dimly flickering light. 
The scent of Westmansweed drifts in faintly from the south.

is set in the southern wall, while an open archway to the east

recent vintage. The iron frame of a candelabra is mounted on the 
north wall. A series of three arched, green-glazed windows have 
been set in the south wall of the room. Some parts of the floor 
seem to be a slightly different color than the rest, lending the 
floor a patched look. A secure oak door rests in the north wall, 
the only exit from this room.

A Raised Balcony Above a Back Lot~
   Long wooden benches ring about this enclosed balcony, 
constructed from wood, each simply made yet fulfilling their 
purpose of granting view down into the lot accessed through the 
gate to the north. The walls of the room have been fashioned 
from stone, an odd combination with the wooden west wall. This 
section of the building looks to be an older piece of 
architecture crudely incorporated into the large hall that lies 
to the west. Iron torch scones ring about the circular balcony, 
casting their flickering light about this area.

Upon the Dirt Floor of a Back Lot~
   Tall wooden stakes rise up around the square that forms this 
small back lot, unevenly matched as for heights and grains of 
wood, and set against crumbling stone walls in all directions. 
The dark earth of the lot is scuffed and uneven. The lot is 
rather compact, wedged between a maze of whitewashed stone 
buildings, and with little room for more than a handful of 
persons. To the south, a steep path rises to a short gate that 
permits entry into a building in that direction.

odour of Westmansweed grows stronger the deeper one goes into the

barrels by the eastern wall. An archway leads out westwards to a 
landing. A few empty crates placed along the northern wall serve 
as impromptu shelving.

   This small, secure-looking shop has a spartan, yet elegant
feel to it. The floors and walls, possibly of the ever present
stone of Minas Tirith buildings, have been panelled with richly
varnished hardwoods, and the windows that gaze westward into
Rath Sind have panes of expensive, patterned glass, skillfully
sanded to diffuse light into a clear, calm illumintation. A
thick, foreign rug covers the floor and the shop has a rich,
wide counter where the trades for gems and jewels, kept behind
display cases, are conducted with hushed, polite tones between
the Master and the customers.

furniture gathers. A narrow staircase with a dark wood banister

while a narrow staircase climbs to the upper floor above a small

this room a sense of open space that it would not otherwise have. 
The walls and floor are fashioned of wood panels, finely stained

bringing color to the eastern wall. The furniture here has been 
neatly arranged against the northern and southern walls. To the 
west a squat door of rich elm wood leads out into the foyer.

A Small Bedroom~
   Seeming to be slightly smaller than its counterpart across the 
hallway, this bedroom has but one small shuttered window, and its 
walls are mostly bare. A simple painting hangs on the western 
wall where another window might otherwise have been, and a fading 
carpet lies on the center of the wood-planked floor.

Decrepit House~
   A rickety, neglected wooden frame forms half of this house, 
the interior bared to the sky through timber slates once covered 
by thatch. This poor workmanship has been built upon a far more 
secure stone base, remnants from some previous age of the ancient 
city of Osgiliath. A large mound of dirt, scattered with 
miscellaneous refuse, slopes upwards against the southern wall of 
the single-room house, soot and dust decorating the rest of the 
space, but little else remains here. A thin, wooden door leads 
north.

slope to a couple of wooden buildings near the corner where the

partially-roofed buildings, housing a large number of beasts of

structure consisting of three walls and a sloped roof. The 
sounds of snorts, grunts, and occasional whinny drift out

of a townhouse has a section of wall to the south remaining, 
though the entire section sways in high winds. East and 
northwards there are no walls, only empty space into the charred 
and jagged remains of Osgiliath below. A fortification can be 
seen to the north, while eastwards are more ruins, blocking any 
view beyond the first few remaining structures, fire-damaged and

Earth-Stained Cellar~
   Solid walls built of regular blocks of white limestone forms

given the large amount of dirt and mud that cakes the entire area 
of the basement. There is little clue as to what has caused the 
cellar to be stained thus, but occasionally a trickle of dirt 
creeps through the wooden ceiling of this room. The southern 
wall of the basement has had a moderately sized hole knocked in 
it, a dark tunnel large enough to accommodate a human stretching 
out, while a trap door sits in the centre of the ceiling here.

Twisting Hand-Dug Tunnel~
   Being the result of hard labour of hands, spades, shovels and 
any other tool used for digging, this tunnel looks to have been 
dug-out rather recently, or at least been maintained. The cool 
air sits stagnant in the passageway as it makes a series of 
sharp, twisting turns that changes its direction from north to 
east. These numerous modifications seem to have been made in 
mind of existing structures, as pieces of stone masonry can 
sometimes be seen through the dirt walls.

scattering of mushrooms growing rampant at the base of the 
north-east corner of the niche. The westernmost section of this

dirt, while to the south ruined masonry can be seen.

Gloomy Intersection of Passages~
   Three passages lead in from the north, east and south to form 
this dank and lonesome intersection beneath the ground. The trio 
of pathways could not be more varied from one another. From the 
north a short construction of well placed stone extends out, 
covered in dust and cobwebs that tell of countless years gone 
past since the chamber has been in use. Eastwards, the dirt 
ceiling juts down for a brief instant, forcing those passing that 
way to crouch in order to pass through, and looks to be the 
remains of a collapsed street. A rough tunnel has been cut 
directly out of the earth by human muscle to the south.

   Ancient cobblestones of a triangle and hexagonal pattern pave 
this desolate street as it heads east to west under the ground of 
the city above. Stretching only a short distance, and by no 
means straight and orderly, the roof of the street is made up of 
a combination of dirt and building stones, supported by the large 
building of stone that line the street to the north and south. 
The road is rather narrow, being little more than a gap in the 
earth under the more recent constructions that lie overhead.

   The back walls of many a squat, stone house face the paved 
road as it progresses a short distance to the east and west here. 
Movement in the former direction extends only a short distance 
before coming to a forcible halt by a huge mass of fallen slabs 
of masonry, rock and dirt, spilling out into the street beyond. 
Not a soul traverses this long abandoned street as it runs deep 
underground, uninhabited save for the numerous rats and other 
vermin that scour the catacombs freely. A door built from 
rotting wood leads into a small, squat building to the south. 
A large hole has been knocked into the northern wall.

Top of a Marble Stairwell~
   The northern half of this small chamber has been built from 
matching blocks of white limestone, strong and sturdy in 
construction, but with little flair of grace. A wooden door is 
set in a square hole cut out for it in the wall, its panels weak 
but the seemingly out-of-place bolt still functional. The 
southern half, however, is one of opulence and richness fallen 
low. A staircase formed of marble spirals downwards, and a 
shattered mural hangs over the south most wall. The two sides 
look mismatched together, the product of separate ages of 
building, and where they join a slight step up to the north is 
required.

   With enough space to perhaps fit only four to five people in

human hand, sloping downwards slightly to the west. Wooden 
boards, slightly rotted and moderately damp, support the ceiling 
of this small enclave, mud visible through the cracks and 
knotholes of the rather lackluster construction. The air here is 
tight and dry, and the only sounds to be heard are the scampering 
of rodents. An intersection of passages lie to the north, while 
the west is shrouded in darkness.

Cylindrical Sewage Pipe~
   Made from lead, this large pipe is immensely tarnished, its 
walls covered in rust, and where they are not, lichen and moss 
grows wildly. A thick layer of dry, crispy mire, contained of 
things far worse than normal dirt and garbage, covers the floor 
of this pipe, letting off a foul smell when disturbed. Sounds 
echo loudly among the water fare, flowing into the pitch black 
that lies at either end of the tunnel. Great volumes of earth 
have collapsed upon the east end of the tunnel, however, a route 
has been dug on a steep slope through this barrier. Westwards 
the pipe continues on.

Grime-Caked Watercourse~
   To the east and west this large pipe runs, ending in stark 
darkness at either end. Large enough for a man to easily stand 
full height in, this tunnel was perhaps once used to move water 
throughout the ancient city of Osgiliath, back in its days of 
glory as Gondor's capital. Now, however, tarnish and fungus rule 
here, a thick film of grime and muck coating the lower half of 
the rounded, metal pipe. Located in the centre of the roof of 
the pipe is a small metal grating, its bars rusted much the same 
as the damaged ladder forged into the northern wall of the pipe 
which allows one access to it. As the tunnel heads west, is 
quickly descends, the surface becoming slippery and slick.

Gaping Hole in the Sewage Pipe~
   The cold, greasy metal of the pipe continues no more to the 
west here, instead, angling sharply downward to a gaping, wide 
hole. At some stage horrific trauma and strain has been applied 
to the tunnel, forcing its lead walls to tear and lead in its new 
direction. The floor surrounding the pipe is littered with 
fungus and moss, hazardous and slippery to any who move about the 
area, while the ground becoming more secure as one moves to the 
east. Dry, stale air wafts out from the hole, presenting an odd 
smell to the nose, but the bottom is far too away to make out 
with any light from this vantage point.

Vertical Climb on a Slippery Tunnel~
   Running almost sheer vertically, this section of broken 
pipeline is perhaps ten feet in length, constructed from lead 
that is now badly dented and tarnished. Wide enough across to 
accommodate even the tallest of men, pieces of limestone and 
other masonry have broken through the pipe in some places, 
jutting out at odd angles. A slimy, slippery film of mud and 
other refuse coats the eastern side of the pipe. Despite all of 
this, handholds formed from wood and the intruding stone have 
been set alongside the eastern-edge of the pipe, allowing one 
determined enough to scale it. At the top of the pipe is 
darkness, while the bottom opens out to a larger chamber.

Caved-In Building~
   A thick carpet of dust has been laid over the cold stone floor 
by the patient hands of time, the walls and ceiling of this room 
also adorned by a layer of grey grime. The air hangs heavy and 
stagnant, long gone undisturbed by anything fresh from the 
surface. The room is strangely empty, devoid of any furniture, 
trappings, hangings, or features at all, simply four walls, a 
ceiling and a floor, all fashioned from the same well-fitted 
stone. A slender archway has been carved from the northern wall, 
allowing access to and from the next room, while a small hatch of 
splintered wood lies at head height in the wall to the south.

Inside a Partially Demolished Structure~
   Untold tons of large pieces of stone, unshaped rock and dirt 
have laid waste to the northern segment of this room, tearing 
through the stone ceiling and sealing off anything past that 
point. Large streaks of earth and deep scars into the stonework 
of the walls and floor race across this room, but little other 
debris is present in the area. A pair of rusty hinges in all 
that remain of a doorway placed in the eastern wall, no hint as 
to what has happened to the door, while an archway plagued with 
cobwebs grants access to another room southwards.

Tight Chute Through a Collapsed Building~
   With barely enough space for three people to squeeze in this 
narrow niche, this tight-fitting chute extends down through the 
wall of this building for a number more feet. Numerous handholds 
in the forms of cracks in the stonework and a set of wooden 
runners allows one to suspend themselves here in the air, but it 
is a treacherous position at best. Dust and cobwebs hang heavy 
along the walls and roof, continually assaulting the nose. A 
large wooden hatch is set in the northern wall, allowing exit 
from this enclave.

Man-made Underground Passage~
   From the east to the west this passageway leads, carving out a 
space beneath the dark, dank earth under the city of Osgiliath. 
Vermin run underfoot as one passes through here, and neither wind 
nor rain reaches down to these depths. The stone hallway is the 
product of fine masonry countless years ago, the limestone blocks 
that form the walls, ceiling and floor fitting together without 
so much as a knife-blade's space between. Yet, other forces have 
laid waste to this corridor. At the eastern end, it bends and 
turns towards the south, that path blocked by a cave-in from the 
collapsed roof. A hole knocked in the east wall allows access to 
a cellar, while to the west the hallway leads into a partially 
demolished structure.

Stone Cellar With Holes Knocked in its Walls~
   Placed under some building upon the surface of the city, this 
stone cellar is filled with dank, musty air and fast-growing 
lichen. Fashioned from a combination of rough stone and wooden 
planks, a few barrels of food as well as numerous scraps of 
wood and midden litter the cellar, nothing of any value left down 
here. What marks this cellar apart from others is the two large 
holes that reside in its east and west walls. Darkness lies in 
either direction, a few loose stones littering the ground from 
this deliberate act. A trap door in the roof of the cellar also 
provides a means to exit it.

Well Constructed Chamber Below the Surface~
   The upper half of this tidy chamber has been formed through 
carefully laid wooden planks, while the bottom of neatly placed 
blocks of limestone. In whole, the room has been rather well 
kept and is rather tidy, if not barren. No furniture, no crates 
nor barrels nor garbage litters this cellar, and only a few 
cobwebs spread across the ceiling. A hole has been knocked in 
the western side of the room, leading into another cellar, but 
the loose stones from that has been neatly stacked beside the 
hole. A second pile of stack stones lie in the south-east corner 
of the room, from a section of the floor that has been removed to 
reveal a trapdoor leading downwards.

Dank, Stone Cavern~
   The southern half of this chamber is composed of ankle-deep, 
encrusted mire, crunching softly whenever stepped upon and those 
that rest in one place too long experience sinking slightly until 
they reach the hard stone floor. A raised platform forms the 
northern half of the area, inhabited by shrivelled lichen and the 
bones of small creatures, ending in dark-stoned walls to the 
north, east and west. To the south, the dry filth continues into 
a larger area. 
   The water is deeper on the west side of the platform.

Gloomy Nexus of Pipes~
   From all directions pipes run into this dark and foreboding 
hub deep under the pavement of Osgiliath, yet no water emits from 
their leaden mouths. Fashioned from dark, dried-slime encrusted 
stone, a most repugnant and a foul bone-dry stench emerges from 
the knee-deep crusty mire that covers this chamber. Scattered 
brickwork lays about the area, this destruction brought upon by 
the massive lead pipe which has fallen through the roof in the 
centre of the area here, a large section missing allowing one to 
ascend up its slippery surface. The darkness continues to the 
north and east, other areas branching off from here.

Upon a Wide Lead Pipe Leading Upward to the East~
   Darkness too distant to be penetrated by any light lingers 
throughout this area, dripping echoes sounding out against the 
cold metal of this half pipe that leads east and west. Too tall 
and slippery for anyone to scale, the chamber it passes through 
seems gigantic, the odd movements of the stale air and nature of 
any noise made here hinting at the size of the area. The pipe 
descends into a pool of mire to the west, and continues a rather 
steep ascent to the east. Dank but somewhat fresher air wafts 
sporadically from somewhere underfoot, its origins difficult to 
discern, as the pipe and the rusted metal bars covering part of 
the ground are covered in muck.

Inside a Filthy Metal Pipe~
   The confines of this small pipe force any and all inside onto 
their belly, movement only available by crawling tediously 
through the filth encrusted metal walls. Rather long, it leads a 
twisted path, but heads in a general direction from east to west. 
As well as being put onto their belly, those who choose to crawl 
through here invariably end up covered by the dirt, mire and 
grease that coat the ring of the pipe, an equally disturbing and 
unwanted smell emanating throughout the tube. A small grating at 
the western end of the pipe allows one to leave it.

Beneath a Hatch Within an Ancient Water Duct~
   The metal walls here feel smooth to the touch, any impurities 
in the lead worn down by the constant flow of water past it. 
However, now the water lies stagnant, only a thin puddle refilled 
from a slight drip in the side of this tiny tunnel, the size 
compact as to force all those who wish to move through here to do 
so on their belly. Lichen grows freely along the low roof of the 
pipe, a few pale toadstools sprouting out to brush the face of 
those who pass through here. The tunnel continues to the west 
for some distance, and at the eastern end, a large hatch made of 
numerous bars of rusted iron allows an exit out to the surface.

Eastern End of the Large Lead Pipe~
   Broken stone and masonry litters the floor of this large, lead 
half-pipe. yet the source remains unknown, pitch dark residing 
in the distance for any who gaze upwards. Large sections of 
tarnish and moss roam across the high walls, reaching far taller 
than a man's head, and as the pipe proceeds further to the east, 
so does it become steeper. At a far point to the east, once the 
upward climb has become near impossible without the aid of rope 
or other tools, the pipe ends, opening onto a dark abyss, 
uprising currents of air bringing strange sounds to the ear. To 
the west, the tunnel descends.

Small Nook Within the Wall~
   This tiny space allows room for perhaps no more than two grown 
men to reside in. Formed of rough stone blocks stacked on top of 
one another, it continues upwards into darkness, progress 
possible through the use of gaps and holes in the masonry. A 
jumble of waste and wooden remains litters the bottom of this 
chute, none of the scraps large enough to lead it to identify 
what may of been here previously. A hatch, large enough to crawl 
through, lies at the north edge of the base of the shaft.

Abandoned, Forgotten Room~
   Small in size, this abandoned room differs from the rest of 
the building it is contained in. The limestone walls are rough 
and heavily damaged, though the structure is sturdy, and the 
architecture is one of squares. Numerous rat warrens have been 
formed out of unidentifiable piles of midden, granting the 
stagnant air a putrid quality here. The eastward leading archway 
from the room bears two iron hinges, yet the door seems to have 
long rotted away. Located halfway up the southmost wall is a 
small head of fragile wood, opening into a small chamber.

Dust-Lined Intersection Within an Age-Old Building~
   Two passageways that cut straight paths through this ancient 
building meet here at an intersection, continuing towards to the 
north, east and west. Stale air resides throughout the 
surroundings, and distant echoes of rock falls and sliding rubble 
occasionally sound out throughout the stone walls. A few 
footsteps are visible in the heavy layer of dust and grime that 
covers the floor, a testament to the fact that some life passes 
through this abandoned city. In the southern wall, a large 
window frame opens outwards to a drop down to a street below.

Rubble-Littered Marble Hallway~
   The nobles and rulers of Osgiliath may have once graced this 
broad, tall hallway. However, now it lies in ruin, a carpet of 
dust covering the floor and stale, humid air hanging heavily 
between its walls. The marble etching that covers the stone 
walls bears many holes and marks in it, and the eastern side of 
the hallway is covered in debris from the collapsed roof. Rock 
of all size, shape and style has been scattered wildly by this 
disaster over the area, providing a hazard for the feet of the 
unwary. To the north and south the hallway continues.

Base of a Chipped Stairwell~
   From the north, a chipped stairwell of marble descends down in 
a full spiral to end at this badly scarred stone-floored landing. 
Circular in dimensions, the base of the staircase is rather 
large, perhaps once serving as a place to pause and meet others 
before the heavy blanket of cobwebs was laid over everything in 
the room. Rusted, frail torch brackets ring around the 
circumference of the area, save for an archway set in the south 
wall which opens onto a hallway leading through the ancient 
building.

   A complete civilisation of lichen, mould and fungus has 
spanned the entirety of this wall and the stone window-ledge that 
juts out before it, making all the surfaces here slippery and 
treacherous to grasp and hold at, and posing a very real risk to 
falling onto the large pile of masonry that lies below. Above 
lies a ceiling of packed earth, pale roots hanging down into the 
empty space. A slow drip of water from the roof gathers in a 
pool of the window ledge. To the north, a broken metal 
window-frame allows access into a large building, darkness 
clouding what may lie there.

Archaic Passageway~
   Any movement throughout this passageway causes the copious

one's eyesight in the already pitch-dark, archaic building. A 
series of arched windows runs across the southern edge of this 
room, yet viewing past the last remaining fragments of glass held 
in the frame, a combination of rock, stone and earth is the only 
sight visible. The marble-faced corridor continues onwards to 
the east and west, its destination shrouded in darkness. To the 
north, a splintered-wood door opens inwards on rusted hinges.

Sprawling, Empty-Shelved Library~
   The remains of a once-grand library are contained within the 
stone walls of this section of the building. Perhaps a dozen 
bookshelves, fashioned from fine stone, line the western, 
southern and northern, edges of the room, as well as dominate the 
centre, forcing those who wish to travel through the library to 
worm their way past them. However, where books once rested, now 
only yellowed and torn scraps of parchment coated with dust lay. 
The shredded and illegible paper covers the floor as grains of 
sand cover a beach. A second wing of the library opens out to 
the east, while a door lies between the bookshelves to the south.

feet below, the eastern wing of the library is in similar

mercilessly by the march of time, and what has avoided being 
ripped and cast upon the floor is instead yellowed and faded to a 
point of illegibility. Small vermin nest in the rough debris 
that covers the floor, and movement through the library producing 
a faint rustling sound. To the west this section of the building

surface, the blocks of stone fitting together in a manner that 
the entire area gives the appearance of being hewn from one great 
stone. Yet, despite the curious workmanship that has built these 
walls, large cracks run along the domed roof, occasionally 
leaking a trail of earth and pebbles onto the floor where a 
sizeable amount already lies. A few tatters of wood still 
attached to a door frame by rusted iron hinges stands to the 
east, while arches allow progress through the building to the 
south and west.

Oddly Shaped Construction Built Atop an Existing Area~
   Though this entire room has been constructed from stone, the 
differences readily apparent between the upper and lower sections

ceiling and top walls, placed with little artistic flair but in a 
manner to survive the ages, and judging by the amount of cobwebs 
adorned over them, they seem to have done so. The bottom half 
also lays built of limestone, but worn smooth and circular in 
structure, looking to have been built in an age previous. A 
graceful archway leads north out of this room, while a large 
trapdoor placed in the centre of the ceiling allows access 
upwards.

Entry Hall of a Forsaken Building ~
   The stagnant, musty air hangs heavy in this small, circular 
room, drifting slowly by the thick layer of niter and cobwebs 
that covers the walls and ceiling, but for the most part is 
absent from the floor. A series of a dozen small windows rings 
about the circle walls, yet rather than offer a glimpse onto the 
outside world, they have been filled with rubble and earth. A 
pair of large yet weak doors set in the eastern wall allows 
access out onto the abandoned streets of the catacombs of 
Osgiliath, the windows either side of the door granting one a 
view of the forsaken labyrinth. Another door leads west into the 
interior of the building.

earth that has risen up about and over this city street. Over 
head there is a good dozen feet of room between the shattered 
cobblestones and the ceiling of pale-roots and stone, yet every 
once in a while a trickle of dirt falls from there to the ground. 
Sounds made in this area echo oddly off the sheer amount of 
collapsed mason-work here, stretching on and down through the 
pitch black that continues to the north and south.

   A hazard to unprotected feet is presented here by the sharp 
edges of the masonry expelled by the collapse of the buildings 
that line the street as it turns from heading to the north and 
east here. Constructed of a design archaic to the current tastes 
of Gondorian architecture, these large, airy buildings now sit 
destroyed by the unmeasurable mass to stone and dirt deposited on 
them, utterly destroyed by whatever force of natured created 
these catacombs deep under the surface. The street turns here to 
head north and east, and to south lies a single building that has 
survived this cataclysm, though the upper floors have been laid 
to waste.

designed to rise above the street below it. However, at this 
section of the city long ago was consigned to dwell beneath the 
surface, the integrity of the arch has faltered, and now lies 
crumbling, the masonry work shifting as weight is put upon it. 
One slide of stone and mortar has already occurred, allowing one 
to clamber down it to the north and rejoin the street. A short 
distance to the east the archway ends in a wall of rubble and 
dirt, while to the west the street leads past the abandoned 
buildings.

   The air here in this subterranean city is dry and stale, 
sitting stagnant, difficult to breath and acrid to the nose. 
Cobwebs stretch out along the great boulders of limestone, and a 
thick layer of dust coats over everything in the area. The 
underground street makes a turns from the east to south here, yet 
as one approaches the latter way they are confronted with a large 
pile of rubble, scaleable though at a the price of hard work. 
The ceiling of earth hangs low in this section of the catacombs, 
forcing those of tall stature to stoop down in some places when 
traversing through here.

   Beginning and ending in the pitch-black darkness that is ever 
present in this bone-dry tunnel deep underground, the pavements 
that lead both east and west have been placed with a skill most 
extraordinary, the cobbles fitting together so tight to prevent 
even a knife blade from sliding between them. Laid over every

niter, and any quick movements through the area cast up the dust 
into the air, creating near fog conditions in the under-gloom.

Atop a Pile of Long-Fallen Masonry~
   Mismatching pieces of masonry and stonework cover the ground 
here, forming a rough, ever-shifting pile held together largely 
by the spider webs that span across it. The dilapidated and 
abandoned stone buildings to the south, east and north have 
contributed to the heap, the wrath of time and the great 
apocalypse that delivered tonnes of earth and stone onto this 
underground city thrusting the stonework of bordering structures 
into this area. The pile slopes downward to the west, and a few 
cobblestones can be seen, the beginnings of a street that soon 
disappears in the darkness of the catacombs. Above, a 
lichen-inhabited window ledge lies.

   The smooth-stone walls of this building feel as marble to the

this building so long ago. A dozen fluted stone pillars support 
the stone ceiling, each a perfect replica of the next in line as 
they lead north to south, placed at the edges of this wide 
corridor. While the progression of time may have left the 
structure of the archaic architecture in good condition, the 
progression of spiders can clearly be traced, gossamer threats 
spanning the roof and walls. A small chamber leads off the 
hallway to the east.

nothing more than a space in the structure of the Bath House once 
used for storage purposes. Save for the small arch which leads 
out to the main hall to the west, every other wall has had half a 
dozen large sections taken out of it, effectively forming 
numerous shelves, each now containing moulded scraps of 
unidentifiable waste. Cold stone forms the ceiling and walls, 
while the cracked, mosaic-tiled floor continues to the west.

Forlorn Corridor Through the Pillars~
   Set between the twin rows of pillars that support the roof in 
the hall as it leads north and south is the cracked remains of 
the intricate tiled mosaic of the floor, depicting a scene of a 
score of tiny human ships battering against the ocean's might. 
Opposite the meticulous work upon the floor, the ceiling is 
equally ruined, large cracks running throughout the stonework, 
the occasional trickle of dirt falling down to further obscure 
the tiles below. The hall ends to the south here, two large 
chambers leading off to the west and south through archways.

Oppresively-Musty Aired Bath-Room~
   A large bath, with easily enough room to hold half a dozen 
people in it, dominates the centre of the room, set downwards 
into the floor, a small staircase allowing one to climb in and 
out of the marble structure. Yet, whatever waters may have once 
flowed here are long gone, dirt and grime encrusted so thickly 
along the walls of the bath and the room that the original stone 
is hard to see. The air hangs heavy in this room, stale and 
locked away here deep underground for countless years. Shallow 
breathes are a best as one can take, the archway to the east 
providing no escape from this.

Gigantic, Rectangular Bath~
   A small section of white-tiled floor leads down via three sets 
of staircases from the northern entrance to this gigantic bath, 
an archway set to the north taking one to the main hall of this 
ancient bath house. At the base of the three small sets of 
stairs lies the floor of this gigantic bath, easily large enough 
to hold well over a score of people. A number of iron pipes can 
be seen jutting out from the western side of the bath, yet the 
south edge has been partially buried by a collapse in the 
white-stone roof, tonnes of loose rock, stone and dirt covering 
the rest of the area in a brown layer of dirt, long undisturbed. 
   However, a small tunnel, scarcely large enough for a tall man 
to stoop through, has been dug, chunks of masonry making up the 
far southern end of the tunnel.

Before a Derelict Building on a Deserted Street~
   All about the area here huge sections of earth and rock have 
fallen, yet despite the great quantity that now resides here, 
even more rests overhead, not more than a dozen feet above the 
ground. Winding throughout the fallout of this natural 
apocalypse is the remains of what may have once been a thriving 
city street, a few shattered remains of buildings having expelled 
their masonry out over the tight-fitting cobblestones that runs 
from east to west here. The street halts in the latter 
direction, coming to the base of a large building that seems to 
have survived rather intact.

Turn South and West on a Uninhabited City Street~
   The path of this underground city street shifts from the west 
to the south here, moving through the great piles of rubble and 
dirt that shift the course of the street in that direction. 
Darkness, deep and boding, blankets the catacombs, stretching 
endlessly in all directions, even when lantern and torch are 
present it still can be felt, ever present. Lining the road as 
it heads south and west are the ruined shells of countless great 
houses, fashioned from stone or brittle timbers, now collapsed 
and crushed by the great press of the earth upon them.

Masonry-Lined Street Before a Decrepit Building~
   Highly decorative cobblestones pave out the street as it heads 
from north to east here, its course disturbed by large chunks of 
fallen masonry and rubble from the roof of earth and stone that 
lies above. Yet the ceramic pictures of the heavens now lie 
cracked, chunks of stone scattered over them, some strange fate 
placing this street and the archaic architecture that rises up 
around it deep below the surface, the stagnant air sitting 
oppressively in the gloom here. A pair of large, rusted iron 
doors, near immoveable, sit to the east, while the street 
continues to the north.

Marble Enclave Covered in Dark Stains~
   This square shaped room is rather small, designed to serve as 
an entry hall and waiting area to a much larger space. Yet, 
whatever its original purpose may have been, the coating of 
cobwebs and dust that now lies here tells the tale that it has 
been many decades since last used. The walls have been hewn from 
stone, yet a thin layer of marble set over this, the softer stone 
now cracked and missing in some areas, revealing the limestone 
beyond. A small domed roof bears upon it a faded painting, the 
details long erased by the passing of time, and now only 
splotches of green and grey are visible. Dark red stains coat 
the floor and walls increasingly so to the east of this room, 
streaking across the rusted iron doors set in the eastern wall. 
A second pair of metal doors has been lies to the west.

spiders and other vermin. Dark stains spot the stone floor and 
walls of this circulare room, yet the latter bears many chips and 
nicks in it, fallen masonry lying about the room. In the centre 
of the area here the floor is rather damaged, the stonework 
disturbed and torn, many blocks simply removed to reveal cold 
dirt below. A set of iron doors leads out of the room to the

Mire-Encrusted Tunnel~
   With walls coated in thick, rancid-smelling mire, this tunnel 
seems to have been man-made, and recently dug at that. A number 
of footprints, ruts, and trails are visible on the ground, though 
many are of origins one can only guess. The walls are of hewn 
stone and, in some places, dirt, and are craggy at best. 
Freshly-fallen chunks of stone dot the ground in places, making 
this place a rather dangerous one to stumble around in.

Rickety, Raised Gantry~
   All the tunnels end here, at a large opening. A raised 
framework of wood and bronze fittings is set near the edge of the 
cavern, which drops off sharply to the east. To the north, a 
lead pipe, wide enough to walk through, leads away, with a few 
inches of water oozing through it. South and west, tunnels lead 
into the darkness. But here, it is open and though it smells 
musty and questionable, there's plenty of room to move. The 
gantry, a spiderlike framework leading from the tunnels to the 
opening, looks designed for a wheeled carriage, but none is in 
evidence now.

cylinder, rushing southward through the dark, easily

of a huge, wide, thick door. Standing water, several inches of it, 
oozes through the tube slowly to the west, where the tube makes a
turn in the darkness. An unwholesome smell rises up from the water,
adding to the general miasma in the tube.

Small Metal Chamber with a Low Roof~
   This chamber's walls of rusted, jagged metal don't help to 
detract from the eerily cramped feeling lended to it by its low, 
sloping roof. Toward the west of the chamber, the roof allows 
most men to stand upright without trouble, though toward the 
east, it forces all but those of dwarf- or hobbit-size to squat, 
kneel, or crawl. At the eastern side of the room, set into the 
angular ceiling, is a hatch, bolted securely with two oddly 
unrusted and shiny locks. Toward the west, a massive door with a 
breadth of at least ten feet looms.

Weapons Workshop~
   An entire wall of this room has been devoted to a row of 
sturdy wooden racks, attached to the stone with iron pins; they 
are used to store weapons in varying stages of completion. On 
the floor, thick green carpet gives way to stained flagstones, a 
few of which are cracked and covered in globs of melted metal. A 
small forge stands to the south, above which opens a soot-filled 
chimney. There is a wooden table against the west wall, its 
surface bearing a multitude of scratches and burn marks. Beside 
it is a shelf holding a collection of worn tools and raw 
materials.

from wooden planks and timber supports, newly whitewashed and 
looking to be in good condition. Opposite it, on the other side 
of the alley, thick, weathered planks have been nailed tightly 
together to form an imposing wall. Boxing in the area to the 
north is the cliffside itself, formed of hard, reddish rock, 
rising a good hundred feet into the air, above which is the 
towering limestone city wall. A permanent shadow is cast over 
the area, slipping into utter darkness once night has fallen. A

Entrance to the Osgiliath Graveyard~
   Set off the quiet street of Rath Turambar, this wide path 
leads southwards to the graveyard of the city of Osgiliath. Twin 
rows of maple trees run parallel to the pathway, and a number of 
other flowers grow in their beds set at certain points along the 
cobbled way. A high stone wall encloses the compound of the 
cemetery, a gate fashioned from iron bars opening inwards to the 
north, two lampposts set either side of it. 
   To the east a circular building fashioned from stone lies, 
while opposite it to the west is a pair of small stone cottages 
and a dirt path, partially obscured by the flora of the area.

Squat, Circular, Stone Building~
   A number of large slabs of stone dominate the centre of this 
plain limestone building, intended as a place for departed souls 
to be placed whilst waiting to be collected by the tender of the 
Osgiliath cemetery. The building is rather light and airy, a 
number of holes cut from the squat roof allowing in sunlight and 
wind. A number of lanterns mounted on iron brackets and set 
about the area casts light throughout the room once the sun has 
set. The archway to the west of the building is wide, opening 
out to the remainder of the graveyard.

Small Cottage~
   Moderately sized pieces of stone, slightly larger than a man's 
head, have been used to form the walls of this cottage. Wooden 
beams that steeple to a point above the centre of the building 
have been covered with thatch to keep out the worst of the 
weather. Little occupies the stone floor of the sole room of 
this small house, only the most rudimentary of furniture and a 
variety of small tools are stacked up against the northern wall. 
A solid oak door in the east wall opens out onto a wide path 
while a sturdy, weathered wooden door set in the west wall opens 
out into a small yard.

City Graveyard Before the Crypts~
   Numerous stone trails lead through the generously sized city 
graveyard, twisting and turning as they lead past moss and vine 
covered headstones and burial plots. Set alongside the paths are 
various beds of flowers, and the occasional shady tree rises up 
amidst the resting spots of the deceased. The meandering cobbles 
continue to the east and west, leading deeper into the cemetery, 
whilst the gates of the compound can be seen to the north. A 
large building fashioned from stone dominates the southern part 
of the graveyard here, a single door leading into the crypts of 
Osgiliath.

Osgiliath Cemetery~
   The graves that are located in this area of the Osgiliath 
cemetery seem to be slightly more recent than others found within 
the graveyard. Large plots set in the ground and recently dug 
can be spotted amongst the headstones and statues, as well as 
holes recently filled with those departed from this life, the 
fresh dirt at the base of a clean headstone the tell-tale sign. 
Few people walk amongst the narrow paths that wind between the 
rows of graves, those that do often bearing flowers or 
expressions of grieving.

Among the Graves~
   Countless headstones bearing the names of souls departed from 
this world sit at the head of burial plots within the graveyard, 
yet statues in noble poses or clad in stone armour have also been 
placed about the grass to commemorate the deceased. Limestone 
walls mark the boundaries of the city cemetery, vines growing 
rapidly up and down their stone structure. Cobbled paths lead 
between the rows of the graves, occasionally heading towards 
private family crypts, each securely locked, holding the dead 
within forever more.

Entryhall of the Crypts~
   The stone architecture of a design and construct to an age 
previous to the current, the crypts are still very much in use 
and operation. A narrow tunnel, wide enough for perhaps two 
people to squeeze past side to side, runs a straight course north 
and south. Five long spaces have been cut out from the stone in 
both the east and west walls, and stored in them are countless 
human bones. Skulls peer down with empty sockets at those who 
walk through the crypts, while a distance down the bones of the 
human arm have been stacked neatly in their alcoves. A stone 
door opens to the north, while the building continues to the 
south.

Stone Tunnel Leading to the Top of a Staircase~
   From shelves cut into the stone walls the bones of the human 
body lie, organised by type and all carefully positioned to 
maximize the amount of storage space available. Each and every 
single bone within the human body has been stored in the crypts 
here, some a dark yellow in colour, others lighter, but all are 
free of any organic remains. There is surprisingly little dust 
or cobwebs in this section of the catacombs, obviously still 
being in use. Stale air rises slowly from a staircase located at 
the end of this tunnel, while fresher breezes can be felt from 
the north.

   Spiralling down from above here is a stone stairwell, little 
ornamentation adorning it. From the base of the staircase and 
further to the north, a near solid wall of cobwebs and dust that 
spreads out from every available surface hampers progress through 
the crypts. The bones of those who died many years ago are 
stacked up in alcoves cut from the stone walls, countless remains 
of people now stored below the surface. To the north, the tunnel 
continues further.

Musty, Niter-Encrusted Tunnel~
   The crypt comes to a halt here, the stone tunnel ending at a 
solid wall of limestone. Dank, musty air sits heavily amongst 
the nite-encrusted stone, the silk spinning of spiders 
crisscrossing the floor and walls, and little sound penetrates 
this far removed from the surface. On the north, east and west 
walls of the crypts, five sections have been cut out from the 
stone, and stored within there are innumerable ancient skulls, 
femurs and ribcages. To the south, the air becomes slightly 
fresher, the tunnel stretching out in that direction.

UNUSED Enry Hall of the Osgiliath Council~
   The interior of this building is crafted entirely from fine 
timber, the mature wood dark and rich in hue. Numerous people, 
most dressed in fine clothing, gather here in the entry hall of 
the Osgiliath City Council Chambers, ready to bring complaints 
and petitions before the councillors that assemble in this 
building. The walls are quite literally adorned with the history 
of the city. Portraits of notables scour the hall with their 
gaze, faded banners are proudly displayed, and above the door set 
in the southern wall a series of shields bearing the chivalric 
devices of dozens of families hang. Suspended from the centre of 
the roof is a large, ornate candelabrum, illuminating the entire 
hall.

of Osgiliath, milling about as they wait for their turn to 
attract the attention of one of the clerks which work the council 
and attend those with petitions to bring to the attention of the 
city at large. As can expected, the occasional frustration is 
vented about the room, but over all the people here keep their 
decorum. Built entirely from expertly fitted wooden timbers, the 
walls are set a moderate space apart, the ceiling not overly high 
off the ground. Leading out to the large entry hall of the 
building is an arch in the western wall, and in the northern wall 
a door opens inwards, heading further back into the structure.

   The motifs of each and every Fellowship of Gondor hang from 
rosewood shields set high upon the walls of this small alcove a 
short distance from the large entry hall to the east. 
Twenty-eight emblems are proudly displayed to those gathered 
below them, and though the excellent paintwork has faded 
somewhat, still the symbols can be made out. The Goldsmiths, 
Coopers, Street-Traders and more meet in this section of the 
Council Building to discuss matters of commerce. Although 
nothing as grand as the Fellowship Halls located throughout 
Gondor, much business is conducted within the wooden walls here. 
Two large doors lead north, a slight stream of Fellows passing 
through them.

chambers in which decisions governing the city of Osgiliath are 
made. The dark wooden walls bear many a piece of historical 
memorabilia, and a large bearskin rug stretches out before the 
two double-doors to the north. Candlelight from the wide archway 
to the south lights the foyer both day and night, but few people 
loiter before the doors. The gentle noises of people murmuring 
sounds through this segment of the building, emanating from the 
large entry hall that lies to the south.

UNUSED The Council Chambers of Osgiliath~
   Built from the finest of hands, this room is large enough to 
encompass well over a hundred people in it comfortably. Three 
tiers of seats rise up around the circular room, hard wooden 
benches with little comfort in mind, yet all flawlessly 
constructed. A large set of double-doors set in the south wall 
open inwards at the base of the room, an old, dark red carpet 
running out to the exquisite mahogany table that dominates the 
centre of the Council Chambers. Set in the high roof are large 
panes of clouded glass, allowing the rays of the sun to fill the 
room during the day, yet shielding people from the bright glare. 
At night, the candle stands placed methodically at the end of 
every bench illuminate the area.

provides light for those gathered in the hall, occasionally 
replenished by servants of the Fellows. Two large doors carved 
from heavy oak are set in the southern wall.

little more than a stairwell. A series of candles placed along 
the wall light the path for any who wish to travel along it. Two 
doors on the ground level allow passage east and south, while a 
door at the top of the staircase leads west. The air here is 
rather stuffy. From the south, the sound of argument and 
habitation can be heard.

them. Relatively well-kept, the shelves seem to be well-dusted 
and the floor swept. The contents of of most of the documents 
here are records and reports of minor importance. A large, glass 
window is set in the southern wall, heavy red curtains pulled 
closed across it. Candles set in bronze sconces on the walls

   This small, simple cottage is little more than a single room 
divided by sparse furnishings. The floor appears to be tightly 
packed earth, and the ceiling and walls have been built from a 
mixture of stone, mud, and roughly hewn timber. The roof is 
thatched, providing some shelter from the elements. On the south 
wall is a plain wooden door; it appears to be the only way in or 
out of the windowless dwelling.

it a rather masculine feel. It is as clean as could be, with 
every surface freshly-scrubbed and barely a hint of soot stain 
upon the stones that surround the arched fireplace set in the 
western wall that radiates warmth throughout the colder months 
and lends to the rather cozy atmosphere that this sitting room 
has. Much of the room's lighting is provided by several , 
well-placed sconces and a mixture of tables, chairs, and other 
furnishings decorate it. A staircase leads up to the second 
storey while a door beneath it leads farther back into the shop 
and another set in the southern wall leads back out into the shop 
front.

   This small, rundown shopfront is a part of the lower floor of 
a stone house, obviously made in a very competent manner at one 
point, though it has long since been uncared for properly. The 
stone walls were panneled in a dark wood, with a window set in 
the east, looking out over the street. The window is now coated 
with dirt and grime, and the stone walls and wood panels have 
cracks and splinters, the mortar falling out in many places. 
Wobbly shelves are built out around the room for display of goods 
for sale, with plenty of room for larger objects below the 
shelves. A door leads west, farther into the building, with 
another to the east, leading out into the street.

panneling on the walls has been planed smooth and clear of scorch 
marks, or replaced entirely. A large hole in the ceiling has

   The hallway ahead leads a very short distance forward to a 
gruesome door that appears to be stained in blood. A generally 
poor job was done carving the whole of the door, but it appears 
to have various mouths and gaping jaws carved into it, as if to 
consume any who passed beyond this hallway. Add to this the 
hallway's eerie darkness and the tight confines, and this room is 
doubly frightening to the claustrophobic.

A Poorly-Kept Subterranean Chamber~
   This room has been shoddily renovated in recent times, though 
it bears some semblances of its past. Dank and musty, the air 
hangs heavily, an occasional rancid strech wafting through. A 
series of braziers light the room, and a few bones sporadically 
litter the dirt floor. The walls of moldy, crumbling stone have 
been whitewashed heavily, though some crude paintings and 
drawings of snakes, bats, and wolves show through. The center of 
the relatively-large chamber is dominated by a dias, upon which 
sits a stone throne. A pedastal filled with murky waters rests 
in front of it, and a few shoddy furnishings pepper the area.

Entrance to an Opulent Courtyard~
   A shell-paved path, wide enough for a carriage, leads from a 
wrought-iron gate to the north to an opulent courtyard just south 
of here. Along the sides of the walkway are lamps on iron 
stands, each one about shoulder-height, with candles in glass 
globes. The lamps are set amid lush greenery, with trees, 
bushes, and fragrant flowers everywhere, kept up perfectly. To 
the east and west, just visible above the garden growth, are tall 
brick walls separating this home from its neighbors. The house 
stands just past the courtyard, with three shallow steps leading 
up to a positively ornate front door.

   Rain drizzles down on this courtyard, pelting down onto the
shell-covered path leading from the entry gate to the north to
the opulent home to the south. The path leads past plants and
greenery that are all perfectly maintained. The rain makes the
lamps, in their wrought-iron bases, sputter a bit when they are
lit, but no matter how hard it comes down, it doesn't put them out.
~
~
   Snow blankets this courtyard in a layer of white, obscuring
its features. A wide path that is nearly always shoveled clean
leads from the wrought-iron gate to the north, through the
courtyard to the opulent home just south of here. Tall walls
surround the property, a pile of snow on top of them as well.
Even the lamps, on their tall iron bases, have snow heaped atop
them.

   Night blankets this courtyard, with its wide, shell-paved path
leading from a wrought-iron gate to the north to a luxurious town-
home to the south. Lamps on iron stands are set along the sides of
the path, amid lush greenery whose scent can be discerned in the
night air, though the plants themselves cannot be discerned easily.

   The night darkens the snowy courtyard to pale blue that turns
to gold when the lamps along its path are lit. The lamps are tall,
set on wrought-iron bases, lining the path all the way from the
wrought-iron gate to the north to the opulent home to the south.
The snow covers everything, obscuring features and muffling sound.

A Spacious Receiving Room~
   This very large front room is tiled in glossy ivory-colored 
stone, with pale grey panelled walls that look like they've been 
polished for a hundred years. Large picture windows along the 
north wall look out on the garden courtyard just outside. Lamps 
set along the walls in ornate gilded sconces provide light when 
the windows prove inadequate. Hangings along the windows and 
along the walls provide festive color to the room, in burgundy, 
indigo, forest green, and gold. Hallways lead off in various 
directions, with the house's front door set to the north.

forest-green rug, while drapes and hangings complete a

A Large Kitchen~
   This large kitchen area has a tile floor and generous 
proportions. The whitewashed walls are stained yellow with 
neglect, and dirt has solidified itself in the crevices between 
the tiles in the floor. One window is in the west wall, boarded 
up and letting no light through. The eastern archway is covered 
by a curtain.

A Small Room~
   This medium-sized room is dusty, with shelves built out on 
some walls. A small, dirty window looks out over the garden to 
the west. The whitewashed walls are of plaster, so all year 
round, the room is fairly cool and dry, though cracks in the 
plaster threaten to mar this trait. The floor is of scratched 
wood.

The Mail of Minas Tirith~
   Sturdy and skillfully fitted planks of dark oak make the floor 
of this well-appointed yet functional shop. The smell of 
cleaning oil, waxed leather and burnished metal fill the interior 
of this sales room, with several types of armors in display 
behind a large, wide counter. On the walls, shields of varied 
sizes, painted with heraldic designs or waiting to bear a symbol 
are displayed, showing the production of the shop's workers. A 
full set of polished steel plate is on display behind the 
counter, testament to the advanced skill of the Master Armorer 
that manages the locale. A strong door leads north back to the 
street, while a seeming sturdy one leaves back west into the 
depth of the shop.

A Whitewashed Living Room~
   Though no windows have been set into the walls of this room, 
it nonetheless has a light, airy feel to it due to the high 
ceiling and series of lamps giving it near-constant warm light. 
The light of these lamps cast shadows along the walls, showing 
their whitewashed, clean appearance. Doors and archways stand in 
each direction, and a staircase in the corner of the room leads 
upwards into a loft.

North of a Junction on Rath Siriondil~
   Two cobblestone roads meet at this junction, as Rath Siriondil 
breaks off from Rath Atanatar and runs northward in a straight, 
regal manner. The street is broad, and evenly paved with light 
grey stones that are swept clean of debris. Lampposts hung with 
oil lanterns are placed on either side of the path at regular 
intervals, keeping it lit in the evening hours. A small number 
of people pass through here intermittently, though few loiter 
around for any long periods of time. The road continues north, 
lined with stonework buildings of good, if aged, construction. 
   A flight of stone steps leads up to a stately looking door set 
into the building on the east side of the cobblestone road while 
a colourful, stained glass window set in the front of the 
building on the west side offers a veiled view of a ledge lined 
with perfume bottles.

Passing Through Private Housing on Rath Siriondil~
   A row of stately homes borders each side of Rath Siriondil, 
constructed of smoothly chiseled, off-white stone. Though 
appearing to be of the same age, these buildings have benefited 
from more recent maintenance than those in nearby areas of the 
city. Narrow alleyways run between each residence, littered with 
bits of refuse that have been pushed out of the way of the main 
stone-cobbled road. A junction is visible to the south, where 
another road crosses east and west, while this one keeps 
traveling northward a short distance.

Rath Siriondil Before a Manor~
   The light grey, stone cobbles of Rath Siriondil come to a stop 
before a tall, wrought iron gate to the north. Discernible 
beyond it is a small courtyard, behind which stands an imposing, 
two-storied structure of stone and hardwood. Mounted on the 
walls, flanking the gate, is a pair of oversized sconces that 
hold flickering torches at all hours of the day. The road runs 
in a straight line southward from here, passing through rows of 
well-kept houses.

Filthy Verticle Shaft~
   Big enough in width and breadth to hold only a single person, 
this dark and grimy metal shaft ascends in a vertical direction 
for well over a dozen yards. A series of spaced metal handholds 
have been placed in the surface of the cold, dirt and grime 
encrusted pipe, allowing one to make their way up and down its 
length. Odd, echoing sounds can be heard from the grating that 
marks the end of the shaft's vertical climb, while utter silence 
flows from the grate at the bottom of the pipe.

over the street to the east. It is a well-tended room, clean and
reflecting a meticulous owner.

Berendel's Sawmill~
   The buzz of the sawmill is deafening. This complex piece of 
machinery is a mass of metal cogs, wheels and sawblades. The 
smell of oil and water used to cool the blades mixes with the 
strong smells of the wood chips which cover the floor. Logs and 
long lengths of cut timber lie strewn all over the room, only the 
area around the sawmill itself if free of these obstacles.

   The road runs both east and west from this point. Small tufts

the occasional smooth stone, which appear to have once been 
cobblestone, though from what time is anyone's guess. For the 
most part the road is made of packed dirt and is lined at the 
edges with tall grasses that come to the knee of a grown man and 
sway in the wind like a sea rippling into the distance both to 
the north and south.

Northeastern Bank of the Anduin Below Osgiliath~
   The mighty River Anduin flows past these riverbanks to the 
west, going from north to south. The land near the river is 
quite fertile, with grass growing and water birds making their 
homes among the reeds that grow near the water. The bank slopes 
gently from the west and the water's edge and rises slightly 
towards the east. Some animals can be seen here though most flee 
when startled. 
   To the north a turret branches off the walls of Osgiliath, the 
city itself stretching out to the west over the River Anduin.

large number of animals doubtlessly kept and cared for here, the 
shopfront seems clean and well-organized. A counter stretches 
along the southern wall, a series of shelves to its left and 
right lined with various riding implements. The room's swept, 
wooden floor sprawls outward, heading northward to a decorated, 
oaken door, and westward to where the animals are kept.

room is to swim out of a pipe, where sewage water is collecting

undergone significant cleaning and scrubbing, and marks upon the 
ceiling indicate attempts to scrub it as well. A small, barred 
window allows view out toward the street below in the southern 
window, and an archway is set in the eastern wall, covered with a 
heavy but ragged tarp. In the southwest corner, a sturdy wooden

A Smoky, Basement Gaming Hall~
A thick layer of smoke hangs in the air of this hidden 
gambling hall, kept clear away from the eyes of the law. A pair 
of tables stand in the center of the room, taking up most of the 
space. The walls are of a dark stone brick which has accumulated 
much dust and dirt. A pair of wall sconces with torches provide 
enough light in the room for someone to see what is occurring, 
yet keeps the place fairly gloomy. 
   To the north, however, the wall has been haphazardly punched 
through, and a tunnel dug into a much gloomier space. The tunnel
has had a crude door rigged across it, with chains padlocking it
into place.

A Small, Basement Safehouse~
   This small flophouse has been constructed off to the side with 
enough supplies and provisions for a few people to hold out down 
here and hide in case the building above was to be raided by the 
law. Of small dimensions, this place could only hold five or six 
people inside of it. Sleeping mats have been left down here as 
well. Though this room does not appear to be particularly 
comfortable, it is only slightly chill and generally devoid of 
bugs and rats.

A Workroom and Living Area~
   This large room is rectangular in shape, with oak-panelled 
walls and a wooden floor that is smooth and glossy with age. It 
is meant to be a multipurpose living area and workroom, with 
plenty of storage and a high ceiling to give an even greater 
impression of roominess.

A Flagstone-Tiled Courtyard~
   Flat, diamond-shaped flagstones are laid out across the 
ground, forming a paved courtyard. Some shrubbery has been 
planted around the edges, and a pair of maple trees stand on 
either side of the southern gate. A stonework wall encompasses 
this space, built flush with the front corners of the building, 
and rise to about twice the height of an average man in all 
directions except to the east, where the lawn continues. A set 
of clean, limestone stairs leads up to the grand oaken doors of 
the manor to the north.

   Sweeping wooden arches, carved with great detail and polished 
to a glossy shine, support the lofty ceiling of this grandiose 
hall. The southern wall is composed of stone blocks, covered 
with a number of hanging tapestries, while wood panels make up 
the remaining walls. An elaborate chandelier hangs from the 
center of the ceiling, its myriad candles keeping the area 
illuminated when no natural light is present. 
   A broad, carpeted hallway extends to the north, while a large 
room opens up just to the east. To the west, a narrower hallway 
is partially hidden behind the edge of a tapestry.

   A short, poorly lit hallway runs east and west here, its floor 
and walls scuffed as though little effort has been made to 
maintain it. Set in the center of the northern wall is a plain, 
wooden door from behind which wafts the scents of cooking and 
food. The passage comes to an end to the west at a linen 
curtain, and opens out to a large, open space eastward.

   Solid blocks of pale-colored stone make up the walls and floor 
of this underground space. Though not large, it does not feel 
too cramped as barrels and crates are stacked neatly against the 
walls, under orderly rows of shelving. A wall-sconce with room 
for one candle is mounted by stairs, while a wood-planked door in

   This narrow alleyway is situated between the two large 
overhanging white-stone buildings facing out onto the wide street 
to the east; the alleyway stretches just far enough to allow 
access to some smaller, less-decorative buildings hiding beneath 
the massive overhang of the white-stone stores. The stone 
cobbles are very clean, and the pathway generally slopes down to 
the south in order to allow for a small trench to carry rainwater 
out to the street to the east. The door, set into the northern 
wall, has been boarded over with heavy pine planks to prevent 
access.

and clearly not part of the original structure. Far beneath the 
ground, the pillars appear to have held up this building even 
when it sunk to ruins below the ground. Since then, the walls 
have been expanded upon and reinforced. Carvings and images of 
snakes, wolves and bats seem to be highly prevalent, and stand 
out amongst the hall.

has apparently attempted to stain the walls -- and failed, to an

hardwood floor sparsely dotted with a collection of furniture, 
and accented by a delicate linen rug. The walls are fashioned of 
a dark, chestnut-colored timber, and are left polished and 
un-painted. A pair of rectangular, clear glass windows provide a 
view of the street to the south as well as ample light during the 
day, a series of sconced, bronze lanterns softly illuminating the 
commons at night. The room is almost always partly occupied by a 
number of patrons, adding to its quaint atmosphere.

A Well-Kept Kitchen~
   This spacious, meticulously maintained kitchen carries a wide 
assortment of equipment and ingredients. The heart of the 
tavern, it clearly is given a great deal of consideration 
regarding its operation and maintenance. The walls hold a 
variety of racks and shelves, and are devoid of any visible 
windows. The smooth, burgundy-hued floorboards are stainless, 
though the thick, umber-painted oaken planks are heavily embedded 
with the scent of hundreds of meals and ales. The counters and 
tables of the kitchen are obviously wiped frequently, and any 
patrons would likely be impressed with the state of this room.

stone floor and walls make this underground space a good deal 
colder than the rest of the tavern. The floorboards above groan 
under the weight of people walking upon them from time to time, 
though a thin stone column with a small ivy pattern engraved on 
it stretches from the smoothed floor to the ceiling, ensuring 
structural integrity. A sturdy door, set in the western wall, 
leads into the brewery.

UNUSED Narrow Landing~
   This small landing, just wide enough for four people to stand 
shoulder to shoulder, is warmly lit by a pair of sconces on the 
western and eastern walls. Stained a rich, earthly umber like 
the commons below, it stretches northward, several doors along 
the hall leading to the private recesses of the inn. The 
constant chatterings of the commons below can be heard from the 
staircase. 
#2A passageway clearly leading downstairs into the commons can be seen here.#0

Square and spacious, this room's walls bear a coat of a mellow
sage green paint. The floorboards are stained and polished to 
a high sheen. A doorway opens eastward, and from beyond it and
through the floorboards, the constant commotion of the commons
below is barely audible.

   Stretching a short distance northward, there are a number of 
doors set into this hallway's walls. Each of the doors sport a 
fairly large and shiny lock. The walls, save the northern one, 
are stained the same rich brown as the landing; the northern wall 
bears a vividly-painted rendition of a battle. A set of steep

battle painting vivid northern wall~
This vividly-colored painting shows a large, imposing fortress,
full of vile depictions of orcs, goblins, and other unnamed beasts,
raining arrows upon a force of humans. In the foreground, a human,
clad in full, shimmering platemail, is swinging a massive broadsword
at a particularly nasty leather-wearing orc. On the side of the
fortress, the skies are grey and stormy; on the side of the humans,
they are sunny and clear. The battle is apparently young; neither side
appears to be winning, as yet.

The Entrance of a Well~
   A rusted ladder plunges straight into the darkness below, as 
well as up into the open. Around the parameter are brick lined 
walls forming a circle. Moss, fungus and grim cover the damp 
surface all over. The occasional resonance of water or pebble 
hitting the ground can be heard.

Entrance to a Spiral Staircase~
   This narrow passage way barely offers room for one person. 
The stairs are uneven and scarcely visible in the poorly lit 
corridor. The stairs spiral around what seems to be a large 
pillar. Engraved on the thick column are winged creatures in 
various poses. Some are perched, while others are in flight. 
The color of all stands out against the grimy grey shade of the 
walls, as a dull blood red.

   As the rutted stairs wind their way around the pillar, more 
light begins to creep in from below. Above the darkness seems to 
envelope the path eerily. Here a dull blood red engraving of a 
winged creature lies locked in combat with some prey that it 
towers over. Faint noises can be heard below, sounds of ruffling 
echoes and barely audible screeches. 
   Dim light is cast up from far below, on the cavern's floor.

longsword in its hand. All of engravings are painted a dull 
blood red. Faint noises can be heard below, sounds of ruffling 
echoes and barely audible screeches. 
  Faint murmurings echo from below, and the glow of light 
casts upward, offering visibility.

A Wide, Open Cavern~
   This wide, open chasm within the earth is rather large, at 
least fifty feet by thirty feet. What little signs of natural 
life that exist are barely noticeable, but it obviously either is 
the den of many humans or was in the recent past. The walls are 
ensconced in crude torches and battered lamps, casting ample 
light about the room; however, this light is not enough to reach 
the ceiling, no less than a hundred feet above. What it touches 
on high above are stalactites, casting forboding shadows on the 
upper walls. 
   Several openings have been tunneled into the chasm's walls.

A Path Leading Away From the Docks~
   This rough path of packed dirt runs in an east to west 
direction, its surface lightly marred with a criss-crossed 
pattern of wagon tracks and footprints. The shoddy road is 
bordered by a thin, rubble-strewn stone wall, beyond which lies a 
sheer drop to the river Anduin. The path curves westward, 
stopping at the door of a large, wood beamed warehouse.

overlook the bend of the Anduin, and provide ample light during

and light during the often cold hours of the night. The wooden 
floor here is dusty and unkempt, and is littered with crates, 
bags and an assortment of tools.

wooden crates and metal tools a testemant to the efforts of the 
dockworkers. Carts and their mounts are scattered about this 
section of the warehouse as well, loaded to the brim with various

furnishings sparse. Though one, heavy desk sits in the corner of

marble basin that seems to be intensively out of place. The 
basin has been stained a dark red around the edges, almost as if 
it has been washed with blood.

two bay windows to the west and south revealing a breathtaking 
view of the rushing water beneath the wooden supports of the 
docks. The walls are made entirely of driftwood, the floor 
fashioned out of pine planks smelling lightly of salt and fish. 
A door to the north leads out to the dock's main wharf, a 
smaller, sidedoor to the east leading down to a rusted metal 
rail, and a wooden platform on the river below.

polished hardwood counters bear little signs of aging; upon the 
numerous racks and counters of the room lie various tunics and 
dresses, all diverse but most of high quality. The clientele is 
rather sparse, mostly well-to-do, but those that purchase 
something always leave looking more well-to-do than they did 
entering. This section of the shop deals with mens' clothing.

A Dilapidated Circular Room~
   Leading away from the archway in the eastern limestone wall, 
this circular room bears a great deal of damage upon its walls, 
floor and ceiling. A few of the wide tiles of alternating black 
and white stone that once covered the floor remain in place but 
most are either missing, broken or covered with dirt. Various 
holes and other signs of decay can be seen between the empty 
torch sconces that line the walls. 
   Along the north side, the outline of two oaken doors can be 
discerned, plastered to match the surrounding wall but visible 
due to the various chips and crumbling plaster along its edges. 
   A little light makes it in from the eastern archway, just 
barely lighting the room.

   Square and snug, this bedchamber is stained a similar brown 
hue as the rest of the building, from the floorboards to the

currents. The sounds of the commons below are sometimes faintly 
audible through the floorboards and, at times, through the 
western door, which leads back to the hallway.

richly stained a deep umber shade, the decoration of the room 
ends there. The southern door opens up into a narrow, lengthy 
hallway, trailing to the staircase. The room is quite silent at

counter in the back and several wooden racks that hold leather 
wares lined up, side by side. A window with well-oiled shutters 
breaks the monotony of the eastern wall, allowing a view of the 
street beyond and a sturdy wooden door is set in the wall behind

   Progressing southward, this hallway has been painted a lavish 
shade of crimson, and several lanterns have been set along its 
length, providing ample light whether at the break of dawn or the 
onset of dusk. Though not traversed nearly as much as the roads 
outside, a small number of people can be seen along its reaches 
from time to time. 
   A pair of broad double-doors are set into the wall to the
north. On the Western side of the hall, a door is set into the
wall, bearing the seal of the Cooks' Fellowship; on the eastern
side, a similar seal on the door depicts the Bakers' Fellowship.

A Hallway through the Fellowships Building~
Stretching both north and south, this vividly crimson-painted
hallway is a constant assailant to the senses. Bright, almost
garish paint floods the view no matter which way one turns;
the smell of cooking food, baking pastries, sawdust, and tanning
leather flood the nostrils as a single conglomerated scent; 
the sound of people chattering and metal-against-metal rings
out from all corners.
  A door to the west is marked with a glob of clay, depicting
the Potters' Fellowship; to the east, a the door is marked
with the candlestick seal of the Chandlers.

A Cozy Dormitory~
   This room is rather small with simple furnishings and decor 
that lend a cozy feel to the space. A small, tawny-brown woven 
rug covers the pine plank floor and the walls have been painted a 
pleasant shade of pale-blue. A door, set in the western wall, 
leads out into a narrow hallway.

the busy kitchen below can be heard through the floorboards. A

   A large, curtained window set in the western wall provides a 
view of Rath Ostoher. The walls have been painted a soothing

mirror, slightly cracked in the lower left corner, graces the 
southern wall. To the east, a doorway leads into a small sitting

Usury Office~
   Built solidly of roughly-hewn blocks of granite reinforced 
with mortar and iron rods, this circular room has been built up 
like a small fortress. The narrow windows shaped like arrow 
slits, and the low doorway with the cast-iron door cast a gloomy 
mood upon the crude reddish walls. A large banner, decorated 
with an elaborate rendering of two partially over-lapping golden 
coins, and a green tassle swinging over the coins in a partial 
spiral hangs from an iron pole, attached to the wall. A heavy 
trapdoor with a formidable lock, blocks an exit downward through 
the stone floor while a low, cast-iron door leads out into the 
street.

Narrow Stone Passageway~
   The walls of this narrow passageway are lined with hewn blocks 
of granite, reinforced with mortar and iron rods. The rods 
preventing would be thieves from tunneling in from the outside. 
The walls, ceiling and floor of the passage have been lined with 
iron plating, adding extra reinforcement to allow the passage to 
withstand an explosive blast. Several bronze lanterns are spaced 
along the passageway, lighting the otherwise pitch dark area. 
The area seems eerily devoid of noise as the walls and iron doors 
block any sound from the outside. A reinforced trapdoor leads up 
into the office while a solid iron door provides access to the 
vault.

Crossing of Roads East of the City Gates~
   An enlarged square of black and white cobblestones has been 
placed here with roads joining from the north, south and east, an 
iron portcullis set in the city wall westwards. Farmers, lower 
class merchants and vagrants all mill about here, heading to and 
from the streets leading off. Dirt can be seen in places where 
paving stones are missing, and this is far from an uncommon 
occurrence. Four cast-iron lamp posts, rusted with old age but 
still able to bear light in the darkness, have been set in each 
of the four corners of this crossroads.

Rath Gil North of a Market~
   This street of Osgiliath is empty, disturbingly so; farming
produce lays rotting in the streets, as does uncollected refuse.
Lanterns and lamp posts are untended, the glass smashed. The 
buildings that line the street are either boarded up, looted, or
but a blackened stone shell. A smoky haze of soot and haze
often hangs in the air, drifting in from the east. An eerie
silence, disturbed only by the rare person to walk through, 
pervades the abandoned and ruined buildings of Osgiliath.

West of a Large Intersection on Rath Gil~
   White-washed buildings line the street of Rath Gil as it heads 
from the city gates to the Star Dome that lays at the heart of 
the city of Osgiliath. Underfoot runs a packed dirt road, the 
occasional basalt or limestone flagstone cropping out from it. 
An intersection of two streets lies to the east, while a 
blacksmith store sits upon the northern edge of Rath Gil, 
sandwiched among run-down houses.

Intersection of Rath Gil and Rath Earendil~
   Through this area two streets of Osgiliath meet in a slightly 
enlarged area. With routes leading to this small square from the 
north, east, south and west it sees a good flow of traffic, 
mostly ill-dressed citizens of the city but also a number of 
wagons and farmers. Cobblestones and hard-packed dirt vie for 
dominance throughout the square here, the flagstones long past 
any organised attempt at maintenance. The white walls of the 
city can be seen rising over the wooden buildings in all 
directions save to the east, where a large domed structure cut 
from stone can be seen instead.

Rath Gil Before the Dome of Stars~
   Rising up high above the rooftops of the slightly dilapidated 
housing of Osgiliath to the east is the Star Dome, once the 
palace of the Kings of Gondor, yet such times are no more. Built 
from square blocks of limestone, the weather has taken its toll 
upon the walls and dome of the building, with large holes into 
the stone visible from street level. The remnants of what may 
have once been a balcony out of the dome juts out from a hole in 
the side, and below it lies a set of tall doors made from oak. 
   A small, abandoned wooden store lies southwards, while an 
intersection of streets can be seen to the west.

Through the Slums of Osgiliath on Rath Earendil~
   The gentle sounds of the city of Osgiliath fload lazily past 
one's ears here; the quiet steps of passersby upon the dirt road, 
the distant striking of metal, a faint rumbling progress of a 
wagon and other slight noises. Buildings in slum conditions are 
set to either side of the unpaved street of Rath Earendil as it 
leads north and south, little noise emerging from those either. 
The white city walls can be seen afar to the north, and the 
curved top of the Dome of Stars is barely visible above the 
rooftops to the east. An intersection of this street and a 
slightly broader road lies to the south, and a ramshackle shop 
stands just to the east.

North and South on Rath Earendil~
   Named so after a king of Gondor is days long past, there is 
little of the insinuated splendor left upon the street; dust 
rises at every footstep from the packed dirt road to coat the 
clothing of passersby, and turns quickly to sludge and mud 
whenever it rains. Shanty-like buildings and midden heaps border 
the road to the west, and a worm-eaten fence borders to the east, 
though a tiny, shadowy alleyway slinks away between its southern 
edge and the wall of a wooden hut.

Shanties and Hovels Border Rath Earendil~
   Cropping out of the dirt road of Rath Earendil are the 
fragments and remains of the black and white cobblestones that 
once composed the road. Now encrusted with dust and filth, they 
are unheeded by the slight trickle of people that walk from place 
to place. An odd assortment of buildings are visible throughout 
the area, constructed with anything from daub-and-wattle wooden 
timbers, to odd-sized, scavenged stone. More often than not, 
they seem abandoned, with collapsed roofs and rotting wood. The 
wall of a large, two-story building sits prominently among the 
buildings to the east, and westward, a small alleyway breaks off, 
leading deeper into the slums.

Junction of Three Roads~
   Three of West Osgiliath's winding dirt roads meet here at a 
brief junction. Rath Cemendur and Rath Earnedil lead west and 
south respectively, while a narrow street seeming more like a 
path through the overhanging derelict buildings leads east. A 
number of cast iron street lamps, long ago succumbed to rust, 
rise up higher than the head of a man here, but no wicks nor 
fresh oil is delivered to them anymore.

Rath Cemendur Passes Dilapidated Buildings~
   From east to west the street of Rath Cemendur runs here, no 
cobblestones marking its way, instead dirt packed by the tread of 
feet guiding the course of the road as it runs parallel to the 
city wall that borders to the north. Climbing up from the ruins 
of age-old buildings to the south, much like a growth of 
mushrooms, are the dingy shanties and shacks that house many of 
the population of Osgiliath.

North of a Rundown Shop on Rath Cemendur~
   Rath Cemendur, like many streets in the semi-deserted city of 
Osgiliath, is named after one of the ancient Gonodorian kings. 
Despite its royal name, the buildings that lie on the southern 
edge of packed earth road are in ruinous conditions, many of the 
makeshift wooden and daub-and-wattle structures having been built 
up from a jumble of limestone rubble. Opposite them is the 
towering city wall, though it too is in far from pristine 
condition, spiderwebs of cracks spreading throughout several 
places in the stone. 
   A small wooden hut sits among the buildings to the south, a 
painted sign nailed to the planked doorway.

Rath Cemendur Leads South into Another Street~
   The unpaved dirt road of Rath Cemendur ends here to the south 
as it meets with another street. Eastward it meanders on, 
running past a row of houses in poor condition, many looking to 
be scant inches away from collapsing. The large, squared blocks 
of limestone that comprise the towering city wall border the road 
to the north and west.

Rath Earnil Leads North and West~
   A corner is created in the walls of Osgiliath as the northern 
and western walls meet, indenting slightly before continuing 
their straight set path marking the perimeter of the city. Rath 
Earnil leads by at the base of the battlements, following the 
path dictated by them. Ramshackle shanties built from scavenged 
material border the packed dirt street, the occasional old ruin 
of stone nestled between the closely packed residences. 
Northwards Rath Earnil ends, becoming Rath Cemendur as the dirt 
road leads east to west by the wall.

A Turn East to South on Rath Earnil~
   The normal straight progression of Rath Earnil is forced to 
shift here as the Osgiliath city wall turns from the east to the 
south here. Set in perpetual twilight during the day due to the 
passage of the wall, and near pitch blackness at night, the 
street here is not made of cobblestones, instead composed of 
hard-packed dirt that quickly turns to mud in wet weather. Few 
people move by here, those that do raggedly clothed and attired.

Rath Earnil Leads North and South by the City Wall~
   The gloom of dusk comes early to the street of Rath Earnil, 
brought upon by the twenty-foot high white stone wall that rises 
up from the packed dirt of the road to the west. The occasional 
odd cobblestone pokes out underfoot in the street, varying in 
make from limestone to basalt, and often tripping the unwary. 
Bordering the street on the east is a row of ramshackle buildings 
built from scrap wood, climbing upward from age-old stone remains 
just visible beneath and around them. A single, sumptuous house 
of stone rises up amongst them.

Rath Earnil North of an Intersection~
   Rath Earnil winds north and south alongside the limestone city 
wall that lies to the west, taking its name after one of the many 
ancient Kings of Gondor, that line now passed with the Stewards 
ruling in their place. This section of the city of Osgiliath has 
fallen into a rather derelict state, with many of the buildings 
bordering the eastern side of the street in near ruin, or nothing 
more then an ancient heap of rock, some so old that vines have 
begun to snake through the rubble. A worn footpath leads through 
the remains of one such collapsed building, winding deeper into 
the slums. To the west, a large archway opens into the base of a 
guard tower, and progress south leads to a crossing of streets.

Approaching an Intersection to the North on Rath Earnil~
   Rath Earnil leads directly to the south from here, following 
the straight limestone walls of the city. A empty market square 
opens up to the east, white and black cobblestones laid down over 
the area, mostly obscured by dust tracked through by the feet and 
wheels of farmers and their carts that have entered the city to 
trade. The street here quickly sheds its cobbles for packed 
dirt, which turns to a muddy mess during wet weather. To the 
west a wide stone archway leads into the base of a tower that 
juts up from the city walls.

Rath Earnil Between the Battlements and Market~
   Large blocks of grainy white limestone squared off to near 
perfection are placed atop of each other to form a towering wall 
that lies to the west, more than twice the height of the tallest 
man. Though still mighty in terms of height and width, faint 
cracks and other minor damage to the wall is visible from the 
dirt street of Rath Earnil that runs at the base of it as it 
heads north and south.

Lanterns and lamp posts are untended, the glass smashed. The

Rath Earnil Merges With Rath Anardil~
   As the western and southern sections of the city wall meet 
here, so do the streets of Rath Earnil and Rath Anardil. Both 
are littered with the fragmented remains of black and white 
cobblestones, and they lead to the south and to the west in a 
near perpetual gloom during the day, the shadow cast over them 
projected by the towering stone blocks of the city wall. A light 
scattering of garbage and refuse left by even the most ardent of 
scavengers litters the path as it nears the wall, the sign of 
poverty mirrored by the shanties and shacks that border the two 
streets to the north and south.

Western End of Rath Anardil~
   Rath Anardil, so named in honour of one of the many past kings 
of Gondor, is now nothing more then a road of dirt and often mud 
that runs at the base of the southern city wall of Osgiliath. It 
narrows slightly as it heads to the east here before turning off 
to the north where it merges with another street, the edges 
pushed closer together by the row of dilapidated and decrepit 
buildings that scrabble up from the ground on the north side of 
the road.

Rath Anardil Runs East and West~
   A very slight upwards climb can be observed here on the street 
of Rath Anardil as it heads further eastwards, the reverse being 
true to those who progress to the west. The dirt street is 
completely clogged of trash or debris, most of it having been 
heaped into large piles cluttered against the walls of the 
run-down huts that form a ragged border to the north. The 
occasional shout or voice is audible from among the housing in 
this area of western Osgiliath, but for the main part, a quiet, 
brooding, atmosphere hangs heavy in the air.

Rath Anardil Alongside the City Wall~
   This stretch of Rath Anardil runs the east to west in a 
straight course, its road composed of a thick layer of dirt under 
which the occasional odd flagstone can be seen. On the northern 
edge of the road runs a row of double story houses constructed 
from timber of all sorts, pine, cedar and oak being the dominant 
styles. Some of the buildings have been built up from older 
stone structures that from the first half of the bottom floor, 
more often then not covered in vines and other noxious weeds. 
Opposite the houses is the southern wall of the city of 
Osgiliath, rising twenty feet high in the air and constructed 
from squared blocks of white, grainy limestone.

Junction of Rath Earendil and Rath Anardil~
   The two streets of Rath Earendil and Rath Anardil meet here, 
the former continuing at the base of the colossal city walls that 
head east and west. The latter road branches out to cut through 
to the north, past the decrepit buildings of western Osgiliath. 
Hard dirt, packed down by the constant trampling of feet, is the 
medium of the road here, yet a few remaining flagstones of basalt 
or limestone rock can be seen jutting upward defiantly.

Rath Earendil Meets a Junction to the South~
   A subdued hush has settled into place over the street of Rath 
Earendil, as well as much of the western half of the city of 
Osgiliath. Towering above the dilapidated houses at the end of 
the street a short distance to the south are the city walls of 
Osgiliath, constructed from large blocks of limestone cut to size 
and placed atop one another with remarkable engineering. A 
narrow alleyway cuts through two buildings to the west, and 
southwards Rath Earendil intersects another street. The doorway 
to a large shopfront stands off the east.

Between Decrepit Buildings Alongside Rath Earendil~
   This street of Osgiliath is empty, disturbingly so; farming
produce lays rotting in the streets, as does uncollected refuse.
Lanterns and lamp posts are untended, the glass smashed. The 
buildings that line the street are either boarded up, looted, or
but a blackened stone shell. A smoky pallor of soot and haze
often hangs in the air, drifting in from the east. An eerie
silence, disturbed only by the rare person to walk through, 
pervades the abandoned and ruined buildings of Osgiliath.

Rath Earendil South of a Meeting of Streets~
   Black and white cobblestones have been laid down on the road of 
Rath Earendil as it leads north and south through the west side 
of the city of Osgiliath. Brown dirt potholes are common 
throughout the street, and a layer of hard packed dirt obscures 
the stones in many places.

By Whitewashed Buildings on Rath Anardil~
   On the northern side of the street of Rath Anardil, numerous 
dilapidated and decrepit houses lie, providing shelter for 
citizens of the west side of Osgiliath. Many of the aging wooden 
townhouses have been coated with whitewash, but a significant 
number bear ancient layers of flaking paint or simply show plain 
wooden timbers. Opposite the row of substandard dwellings is the 
southern city wall, towering twenty feet into the air.

North of a Portcullis in the City Wall~
   The street of Rath Anardil ends here to the east, where a 
solid stone railing bars careless wanderers from plunging over 
the cliffside and onto the rooftop of the warehouse a good couple 
dozen feet below, built right on the docks themselves. The view 
of the dock's lengthy sprawl across the dark blue river is a very 
good one, tiny ant-sized soldiers, orcs and goblins visible as 
they go about their daily business unloading the white-sailed 
ships that have dropped anchor there. On clear days, the eastern 
side of the city of Osgiliath can be glimpsed far across the 
waters, and bridging the two halves to the northeast is the 
gigantic Star Dome and the mighty bridge that runs through it. A 
portcullis is set in the limestone wall to the south, allowing 
access to a wide roadway that winds down the sloped cliffside.

Under the Southern Wall~
   White, grainy limestone lies in all directions in all 
directions, whether composing the huge, square-cut blocks that 
stand overhead and to either side, or the rectangular cobbles 
used to pave this section through the Osgiliath city walls. 
Burning torches dispel the darkness to the corners of the low 
ceiling of the passageway, regularly replaced by the armoured 
guardsmen that move through this area. To the north and south 
heavy iron portcullis' have been placed over the entrances and 
exits that lead out of this space, allowing access to either the 
inner city of Osgiliath or its southern docks.

A Cobbled Road Before A Portcullis Leading Into Osgiliath~
   A pair of banners of the colors gold upon royal blue hang from 
iron posts set in the limestone wall to the north to either side 
of the massive portcullis, fluttering proudly in any breeze. A 
well-cobbled road with only a few missing cobbles leads off on a 
somewhat steep, winding path down the cliffside, toward the docks 
that stretch out over the wide waters of the river Anduin that 
runs its course to the east, stretching as far north and south as 
one can see. The river bends slightly westward to the south, and 
the opposite side can be seen on clear days, though it is little 
more than a hazy purple line. A stone wall borders the cliffside 
to the east and south, grass and weeds sprouting up about the 
posts. It is sturdy and high enough to prevent carts or wagons 
from tumbling off.

Dirt Path to the East of a Junction~
   Large, derelict double-story buildings loom up menacingly over 
this thin dirt path as it leads east and west. Perhaps once 
bustling warehouses full of goods and laborers, now they stand 
abandoned, their dark wooden walls contrasting bleakly against 
the limestone city wall that rises up to the north behind them. 
A still silence holds over this area here, the only sounds being 
the pattering footsteps of the lone wanderer through this area 
played upon a backdrop of the noises of this near deserted 
section of Osgiliath. A junction lies to the west, while to the 
east, white stone rubble is piled up into a large mound.

Atop a Mound of Ancient Stone Rubble~
   Shifting treacherously underfoot here is a loose collection of 
rubble and waste. Composed mostly of broken blocks of limestone 
in all shapes and sizes, fragments of wooden beams, pieces of 
pottery and shards of glass all feature throughout, an edged 
hazard to the bare foot. Soot and ash have fallen in the deeper 
cracks of the mound, rising perhaps half a dozen feet above the 
level of a narrow dirt trail that slinks around it branching off 
to the east, west, and south. The corner of a whitewashed 
building borders against the mound to the southwest, while the 
towering city wall stands firmly to the north.

Twisted Path~
   Twisting a crooked course through scattered piles of refuse 
and fallen masonry and timber, this alley is barely more than a 
footpath, though it seems to have been widened recently, debris 
piled to either side. Walls lie to either side, flaking paint 
and rotting wood a testament to the gradual decay of this area. 
A huge building, once constructed of stone, now resides only as a 
mound of rubble to the north, the path skirting about it. 
Southward, a recently refurbished warehouse marks the end of the 
road. An immense set of double-doors that once provided access 
have been nailed securely shut with cross-beams of wood, and a 
considerably smaller doorway has been built right within the 
framework of the old ones.

Rubble-Scattered Backlot~
   This area was once perhaps the back lot of a thriving 
business, yet now the building to which is belonged to is buried 
under a pile of the most repulsive refuse that forms a gigantic 
stack to the east. The occasional piece of stone can be seen 
littered around the vine-choked ground here, rodents and other 
alley life skittering and scampering along the ground at sight of 
a human presence. Alley cats and large rats can occasionally be 
seen slinking through large gaps in the rickety woodworm-infested 
fence that borders the lot to the south and west, glimpses of the 
street beyond visible from the right angle.

A Planked Dockway Near a Large Warehouse~
   This somewhat narrow wooden dockway is extremely sturdy 
underfoot, though its planks are weathered and faded with time. 
It is still plenty large enough for a cart to come and go, and it 
leads up to the broad entryway of a large, wood-beamed warehouse, 
the walls of which loom up to the west and south. Eastward sits 
a well-kept wooden building, its door painted a bright, cheery 
white, somewhat startling against the rest of the drab, 
wood-toned structures nearby.

overlook the bend of the Anduin, and provide ample light during

There is a great deal of activity during most hours of the day

metal tools a testemant to the efforts of the dockworkers. Carts

and complicated riggings of ships can often be seen at the ends 
of the docks where one has berthed, visible beyond the rooftops
of various buildings and warehouses. Shouts and clamor fill the
air at all times of day, lanterns flickering on tall wooden poles 
to light the area at night.

A Spacious Wooden Dock Near A Warehouse~
   Oak planks have been laid down over larger beams to form the 
wooden boardwalk of the Osgiliath Docks, built at the base of a 
towering cliffside, atop which are the limestone walls of the 
city itself. A wide roadway is visible in the distance to the 
east as it climbs up the slope, and the docks themselves sprawl 
out to the east and south. Held above the waters of the River 
Anduin, activity is never far away on the docks, with barges and 
other river craft tying up and casting off, bringing goods to and 
from the city for trade along other cities located along the 
river. A crowd of sailors, merchants, and citizens pass through 
this area, going about their business, and the occasional 
patrolman strolls by, helping to keep the peace. A large 
warehouse stands up against the cliffside to the north.

expansive dockway, which feels nonetheless rather crowded with 
the constant flow of people wandering by, ranging from sailors to 
merchants and the occasional patrolman. The wood underfoot is 
weathered by time and use but is still plenty strong enough to 
support the weight of the carts and wagons that occasionally 
rumble past, taking their cargo to the various warehouses among 
the docks, or to the ships and barges prepared to transport it. 
Wooden huts and huge warehouses are crammed against each other to 
the north and south, a long wooden walkway extending eastward 
over the rushing, dark waters of the Anduin River.

Well Organised Floor Of A Warehouse~
   This expansive, open warehouse sees a brisk traffic of large 
crates in and out of the large double-doors that sit to the 
south, men of sober clothing and large build moving in and out of 
the warehouse playing their part in the bustling river trade of 
the Osgiliath wharves. The stream of men are pushed aside by the 
occasional wagon or cart, and a number of somewhat more 
well-dressed men move throughout the wide floors yelling at the 
labourers and teamsters. All this hustle and bustles occurs over 
the spartan wooden floor and between the plain wooden walls, both 
appearing of recent construct by the unmellowed wood. A large 
door leads north, the occasional box moving in and out of the 
area that lies beyond it.

Cluttered Office And Living Quarters~
   Countless empty crates, barrels and boxes rest in stacks 
coated lightly with dust and cobwebs, taking up the corners and 
edges of this room, snatching the already small space and 
creating a clutter. Set in the middle of the room amongst the 
boxes is a series of desks, each covered in parchments, and to 
the northern side of the room a small living space has been 
carved out from the reign of the crates. To the south, a small 
door is just visible, the boxes shoved to either side to allow 
passage through it.

Beneath the crates a large trapdoor can be seen, beyond it a
ramp ascending at an easy curve. A brief re-organisation of
the crates in the north-eastern corner, which sport less cobwebs
and dust than the others in the room, easily allows one to open
the trapdoor.

Dank, Dismal Cellar Of Stone~
   This large cellar has been constructed of stone, and at some 
years passed if the thick layer of moss wedged between the grey 
stones in any indication of the passing time this basement has 
stood for. Little fresh air stirs here, instead a dank, musty 
aroma hangs over the area, coupled with the scent of old sweat. 
Dark stains mark the stone walls and floor of this underground 
chamber, and many boxes and barrels, of all descriptions and 
sizes, lay about the area, a large pile of crates set at the 
northern wall. Leading upwards across the eastern wall in a 
ramp, ascending at a gentle curve to aid in moving between the 
dismal cellar and the trapdoor in the ceiling.

A Long, Weathered Wooden Dock~
   Narrower than the huge, crowded expanse of dockway that lies 
just to the west, this planked walkway is still wide enough for a 
cart or wagon to travel without much difficulty, and occasionally 
the crowds of sailors, merchants, and citizens part for one to do 
just that. Ships and barges dock often toward the ends of this 
walkway, their riggings clearly visible against the dark 
blue-green backdrop of the wide Anduin River that flows north and 
south, stretching eastward almost as far as the eye can see. On 
clear days, the purplish outline of the opposite shore is 
visible, and the impressive arch of the Bele-Iant is clearly seen 
in the air to the north.

A Weathered Wooden Dock Crowded With People~
   Stretching for some distance east and west, this planked 
wooden walkway is made of heavy, thick lumber that has faded to a 
greyish brown due to time and weather, splattered here and there 
with seagull droppings. The impressive sweep of the Anduin's 
deep blue-green waters extends for as far as the eye can see to 
the north and south, the dim purplish line of the opposite shore 
visible to the east, across the river. The stone arch of the 
Bele-Iant can be clearly viewed from here, straddling the waters, 
as well as the grand structure of the Star Dome itself, to either 
side of the covered bridge.

The End Of A Weathered Wooden Dockway~
   The sturdy, thickly-planked wooden dock ends here, bordered by 
stout, round piers that are often splattered with bird droppings. 
Huge sailboats or barges are often seen lashed up to either side, 
sailors moving busily up and down the planks to transport crates 
and boxes and barrels of cargo. The view, when not obscured by 
the masses of rigging and the fluttering white sails of ships, is 
expansive, providing a clear look at the rushing river Anduin as 
it flows swiftly from north to south. Far across the blue-green 
waters, the opposite shore is visible as a smudge of 
purplish-green, and the greyish line of the city's limestone 
walls is just able to be glimpsed. The Star Dome itself 
straddles either side of the impressive Bele-Iant, a covered 
bridge that arches across the river to connect the two sides of 
the city of Osgiliath.

A Decrepit Houseboat Reeking of Fish~
   Long since sea-worthy, this houseboat has been permanently 
moored to the dockside by way of several ropes and a sturdy 
wooden plank. It bobs gently in the water, a narrow rim around 
the outside of the boat providing space to stand on and gaze out 
over the river. A railing keeps careless people from slipping 
off, its wooden boards about waist-height. The rest of the boat 
is a large building, one end open to the elements and customers, 
and a trapdoor sits in the floor, presumably leading into the 
boat's hold below. The air reeks of fish, both fresh and old, 
the occasional breeze doing little to dispell it.

A Sturdy Wooden Boardwalk Branching Southward~
   Worn to a greyish hue due to weather and time, this thickly 
planked wooden dockway remains sturdy enough to easily support 
the weight of the piles of crates and barrels that are often 
stacked upon it, as well as the passage of the various carts and 
wagons travelling through. It gives an orderly, sharp turn 
southward, barges or sailing ships often docking to the east, 
lashing themselves with rope to the thick, sturdy piers. The 
waters of the Anduin rush downriver from north to south, 
stretching out almost far as the eye can see, and to the north 
across the waters, another sprawling section of the Osgiliath 
docks is visible, when the light is good and the weather clear. 
Far off to the east, a smudge of purplish-green marks the 
opposite shore of the river.

A Weathered, Thick-Planked Wooden Dock~
   White paint has liberally been applied to this wide wharf as 
it leads off over the dark waters of the River Anduin and off the 
docks of Osgiliath that lie to the north. A slight flow of river 
traffic casts off and ties up to the various beams of its length, 
sailors and merchants clustering about the docks hauling and 
checking away at the cargo the small river craft of the Anduin 
ferry back and forth across its waters. To the south is a 
planked wooden building constructed right onto the end of the 
wharf, a weather-beaten door providing access.

   This musty, open building sits directly alongside the Anduin, 
two bay windows to the west and south revealing a breathtaking 
view of the rushing water beneath the wooden supports of the 
docks. The walls are made entirely of driftwood, the floor 
fashioned out of pine planks smelling lightly of salt and fish. 
A door to the north leads out to the dock's wooden wharf, a 
smaller, sidedoor to the east leading down to a rusted metal 
rail, and a wooden platform on the river below.

A Winding, Cobbled Road Along a Steeply Slanted Slope~
   This wide, cobbled road slopes steeply, but not too much for 
the carts and wagons that occasionally rumble past, going between 
the city and the expansive wooden docks visible off to the east. 
Straggly greyish-green grass sprouts to either side of the road, 
with a few trees clinging stubbornly to the reddish slope, their 
roots plunging deep into the rocky earth. The white-stoned road 
itself bends eastward toward the city wall visible far above, and 
further southward, slanting down closer to the docks.

condition, beginning to slant upward as it winds westward away 
from the docks visible just to the east, chopped out a steep 
cliffside, a few trees and sparse grasses stubbornly thriving 
along the edges of the road itself. The road is still passable, 
though somewhat laborious, for wagons and carts, a few of which 
rumble by occasionally with their loads of goods, moving between 
the city far above and the sprawling, wooden docks that stretch 
over the rushing waters of the river Anduin.

   This planked wooden dock was obviously constructed many, many 
years ago, the colors of the wood greyed and weathered over time. 
However, it is still sturdy underfoot, creaking only a little as 
wagons and carts rumble past, along with a throng of sailors and 
citizens going about their business here. The docks sprawl out 
for quite a ways to the east, stretching far over the rushing 
blue-green waters of the Anduin River. Southward, a large 
warehouse is just visible over the crowds of people, and various 
other buildings jut up from the wide dockways off to the east.

Cobbled Market Square~
   Black and white cobblestones have been laid down over the dirt 
to form this large swath of market square, the ground upon they 
are placed upon still visible in the form of potholes and missing 
stones. The normal subdued murmur of western Osgiliath is shed 
with the hustle and bustle of the market here, farmers and 
peddlers shouting out the qualities of their wares on display 
from numerous stalls, wagons, tents or simply carried about on a 
tray. The market continues to the east and south, while the 
streets of the city lay in all other directions.

Winding Path Through Tents and Stalls~
   The lively market is bordered in by the outer walls of several 
buildings, the largest being a cedar-wood wall to the north. 
Despite these restrictions, the trade still progresses in 
earnest, with hawkers, merchants, stall vendors and more offering 
wares for sale. There is a distinct rural atmosphere to the path 
through the various tents and stalls, most of the products for 
sale being agricultural in nature, mingled with a few 
flowersellers and hawkers offering trinkets or baubles. The 
eastern side of the path is bordered by a tall, wrought iron 
fence with a matching gate. A view of a lush, inviting garden 
can be seen through the wrought iron bars of the fence.

Farmer's Market~
      Iron lampposts periodically rise up from the basalt and

area of business long after the sun's rays have departed for the 
day. Composed of a vast multitude of noises and smells, a 
fluxing number of merchants with varying wares attempt to make a 
sale to the steady flow of people that pass through. Tents and 
stalls signal a few of the more permanent traders, many others 
simply holding their goods for sale and advertising loudly to the 
area around them at general.

Lively Market Stalls~
   Citizens of the decrepit city of Osgiliath wander about the 
bustling market situated in this cobbled city square, browsing 
through the goods offered by the various merchants, hawkers and 
hucksters that have set up stalls and small tents here. A gala 
of colour, sights and smells is presented to those that stray 
into the thick of business, compounded with the cries of 
promotion that echo off against the paving stones. To the west a 
city street runs past the market, few if any people travelling 
across it, the near deserted facet of Osgiliath present only a 
few feet away from this area of concentrated activity. 
   A colorful display of glass bottles is arranged in the window 
of a small shop that borders the square to the south.

freshly cleaned and darkened with age, and a large, woven blue 
wool rug covers most of the wood-planked floor. A wide 
glass-paned window lets in plenty of sunshine during the day, 
curtains hung to either side to drop down at night.

A Rundown Pawn Shop~
   This old shop is quite rundown and shows only recent signs of 
being rather poorly remodeled. Row upon row of old wooden 
planking showing numerous nicks and scars bereft of any windows 
gives this place a certain claustrophobic feel, and the pure 
clutter throughout the room does little to help deter this image. 
The floor is made of equally old planking which tends to groan 
when too much weight is put on it. Old burn scar marks are also 
revealed hinting that a fire may have been the cause for this 
store's remodeling. The shelves, racks, and spindly tables are 
piled high with various knick-knacks, stacks of clothing, and 
various odds and ends of all sorts, leaving very little 
floor-space to maneuver about.

Perhaps half a dozen each of shelves and benches are set up

goods and household furnitures. A solid oak door held securely 
on by a pair of bronze hinges opens out to the street, set in the 
south wall. Another narrow door opens out to a narrow alley

Underfoot, the entire floor has been draped with rugs, keeping 
the cold stone beneath from touching one's feet. A sparse 
smattering of furniture about the room allows one to relax, if 
they were so inclined, and the windows in the western wall give 
light during the daytime, especially at sunset. The 
earthen-coloured walls are interrupted only by a pair of doors: 
one due west, the other due east.

collapse of the stone structure, progress can be made to and from 
the street of Rath Earnil to the west and the dark, packed dirt 
alleyway that runs eastward.

   This refuse-cluttered alleyway seems to have been formed 
slowly over time, cramped enough that those who pass through must 
go single-file. Vines dangle from the walls, and the occasional 
gleam of vermin eyes can be glimpsed among the shadows, 
skittering sounds audible from time to time. The way widens to 
the east into an intersection, and to the west, the alley cuts 
through the decayed hulk of a now-collapsed house.

few save the swarm of rats and other alley life that thrives in 
this area. The directions of north, east and west all lead 
through the dark buildings, the twin stories of the houses 
casting an early shadow over the refuse-cluttered streets early 
and late during the day, at night a pitch darkness falling in its 
place. Decrepit buildings turn their backs to this alley, 
forming a tightly-packed border blocking any progress southward.

An Alleyway Slinking East to West~
   A large, secure building fashioned from grainy white stone 
borders the northern side of the alleyway here, its small windows 
covered over with planks of wood. Moss grows freely along the 
lower ranges of its stone structure, and fungi extending to make 
parts of the rough-shod path of dirt here slippery to those 
careless of foot. The alley makes a crooked, twisted path to 
both the east and west, past more derelict and abandoned houses.

A Sharp Twist in an Alleyway~
   The alleyway makes a sharp turn from north to west here, its 
path forced so by a large shipment of now rotted lumber never 
collected by its distant owner. A thick layer of dirt serves as 
the means with which to make progress along this narrow road, but 
still some fragments of the original cobbles stick at odd angles. 
Ramshackle huts built from scrap material and the gutted remains 
of once grand town-houses line the street either side, and one 
faces the alley, a battered-looking wooden door set amidst its 
moldy stone walls.

A Cramped Space Between Buildings in Osgiliath's Slums~
   This narrow dirt alleyway is little more than an accidental 
space between the decaying husks of the slumhouses to the east, 
and the towering white stone wall of a building to the west. 
Quiet squeaks and skitters can be heard occasionally, drifting 
through the air along with the distant sounds of slum life. Few 
footsteps besides those of alley vermin can be seen, and refuse 
is scattered carelessly over the packed dirt ground.

A Cramped Space Between Buildings in Osgiliath's Slums~
   The cold stone wall of a warehouse looms up above to the west 
of this tiny dirt path, which is little more than a space between 
buildings, the ones to the east being little more than empty 
hulks of once-grand stone and wood buildings. Trash litters the 
area, piled up off to the side, and rats scurry about in the 
shadows, their eyes occasionally gleaming from beneath a stack of 
broken crates tossed some time ago against the western wall.

A Sharply Twisting Dirt Alleyway~
   This dirt path winds its way through the derelict buildings of 
the city slums, many structures long vacated of human residence 
and now occupied by bats, vermin, spiders and dust. Few citizens 
of the once-fair city can be seen passing through here, and the 
alley splits at the stone wall of an ancient stone storehouse to 
run west and south. Mingled with trash, weeds grow profusely by 
the edge of the path, and tangled growths of deep green vines 
snake up the crumbling stone wall of a house to the north.

A Winding Alley Cluttered With Midden Heaps~
   This meandering alley is little more than a gap between two 
decrepit stone buildings, making it a slight squeeze for more 
than a couple humanoids to move through at a time. The dirt path 
is made even more precarious by the debris littered across it, 
the obstacles varying from piles of discarded rags, midden heaps 
of stinking refuse and rotting foot, and even street-animal 
corpses. Despite the neglect, the houses in this area have 
survived, due to their construction being of stone; a reminder of 
the lost prosperity of the city.

A Small Dirt Square Surrounded by Shanties and Hovels~
   The narrow dirt alleys widen here into a small, squarish 
opening between a few derelict buildings to the north and a tall, 
crumbling stone wall to the south. The ground has been packed 
over time by footsteps until it is nearly as hard as stone, 
softening only slightly when it rains. The sky is more visible 
in this area, a change from the mere sliver visible when moving 
through the cramped passageways of this rundown slum area of 
Osgiliath. The way narrows once more to the east and west, and a 
thin wooden door sits to the north, a peeling painted sign nailed 
securely in the center of it.

A Knife-Edged Twist in a Narrow Alleyway~
   Stretching out from a narrow square to the east, this cramped 
dirt pathway takes a sharp twist around the stone corner of a 
tall warehouse to the southeast, hemmed in to the north and west 
by the decaying hulks of the slum shanties populating most of 
this section of western Osgiliath. Refuse and scraps of clothing 
and other less savory material is trampled in with the dirt, rats 
and mangy street animals prowling hungrily about in the shadows 
to pick at whatever a scavenging human may have looked over or 
discarded as too unpalatable. The way widens slightly to the 
south, opening up between the warehouse wall and another hovel.

A Forked Intersection of Two Alleyways~
   The crooked dirt trail splits off around the corner of a squat 
wooden shack to the southwest, snaking its way through the 
clustered houses. To the east, tall, crumbling stone wall of a 
warehouse borders the pathway, trampled weeds poking up 
occasionally at the base of the building. The way is not overly 
cluttered, as the trash is mostly kicked off to the side or 
ground into the dust by the passage of feet and time. The narrow 
alleyway slinks on to the north, south, or west.

   The cold, crumbling stone wall of a tall warehouse to the east 
casts a shadow over this narrow space between that building and a 
small wooden hut to the west. The trail itself is simply packed 
dirt, strewn with pebbles and the occasional clump of trash. It 
runs directly north and south, where it widens a bit. A mere 
sliver of sky is visible overhead, just beyond the rooftops of 
the closely cramped buildings.

A Short Alleyway Splitting off an Intersection to the East~
   Extending only a short way to the west, this alley comes to an 
abrupt dead end, sandwiched between tall, rundown shacks. 
Battered doorways stand to the west and south, the other 
buildings choosing to turn their backs on this decrepit little 
slice of alleway. The ground underfoot is merely packed dirt, 
bits of refuse and scraps of various unidentifiable items 
scattered about here and there. Rats and mangy alley animals 
skulk about in the shadows, the gleam of eyes visible 
occasionally here and there.

A Shabby First Floor~
   Though spacious, this first story has obviously led a hard 
life. The walls are of horizontal wooden timbers, which are old 
and painted a dull, dirty white where they are not missing 
entirely. The floor is entirely composed of stained dark-red 
timbers, which look to be recently replaced for some reason or 
another. Wherever one happens to step, the boards creak softly 
beneath the foot, though they are not rickety by any means. The 
eastern wall bears a faded, tattered, and worn tapestry, whose 
lower right corner seems to have been burned away a little. The 
northern wall bears a window, and the western, a staircase 
leading to the cellar. The room smells faintly, no matter what 
time of day or what weather, of jasmine and lavender, though more 
pungent scents occasionally waft in from outside.

   The remains of some rickety splintered building are scattered 
about the stonework foundation, long ruined since it was erected 
in some bygone age. A large mound of muck and refuse is all that 
supports the southern wall of the former structure. Trash and 
midden heaps are strewn about the lot and the sound of small feet 
can be heard crunching softly under the debris. The fence 
bordering the southern extant of this lot has collapsed.

are covered in a chequered mosaic of black and white clay tiles, 
except for around the grand fireplace that dominates one wall 
which is made of large, grey stones. Hallways branch off in all 
directions from here, leading to private bedchambers and Fellows, 
mostly of Journeyman and Apprentice rank, can be seen frequenting 
the halls, keeping this common room rather busy and bustling.

   This tiny alleyway seems almost accidental, but is wide enough 
for a couple people to walk abreast. A rickety, tall wooden 
fence blocks passage to the north, though several slats are loose 
and bang quietly whenever the wind blows hard enough. Various 
forms of refuse are scattered over the dirt ground, and mangy 
alleycats and vermin can often be seen slinking about in the 
shadows. The road of Rath Earendil is visible just to the west, 
and to the east, the narrow alley continues.

A Narrow Alleyway Passing a Large Three-Story Building~
   Cast into pitch-black darkness at night, and murky shadows 
during the brightest times of day, this narrow alleyway still 
bears the print of many footsteps trodding through the dirt and 
trash. Mingled with those are the tracks of rats and other 
undesirable alley life, and eyes occasionally gleam from the 
shadows. Vines grow profusely over the windowless walls of the 
decrepit stone buildings that lie to either side, and weeds have 
sprouted off to the sides of the pathway.

board-covered entrance of an immense, once-grand stone building 
to the south that has now fallen into obvious disrepair. The 
ground is packed dirt mingled with unsavory and mostly 
unidentifiable refuse, and many human tracks are visible, mingled 
with those of alley cats and vermin. The smells and sounds of 
slum life are rather strong here, shouts and clamor audible in 
the heavy air. The way narrows to the east and west, and a dirt 
alley slinks off into the shadows to the north.

stone wall of the Star Dome, the roof of which rises majestically 
above the squalor and filth the slums. The moldy stone wall of a

the opposite side of the alley, a narrow, splintery wooden door 
sits between this area and the interior of a shack, which is 
built of faded wooden planks.

A Narrow Alley Slinking Through Slum Housing~
   This narrow dirt pathway wends north through slum shanties and 
warehouses, and southward it widens slightly into a small 
intersection. Shredded bits of clothing, trash, and scraps of 
inedible food are piled off to one side, the stench mingling 
curiously with the occasional whiff of westmansweed and ale. 
Shouts and noise often punctuate the air, and any gust of wind 
causes shutters to bang and rickety wooden walls to creak. 
Shadowy even during the brightest day, this small slice of the 
slums is pitch dark at night-time.

A Narrow Alley Slinking Through Slum Housing~
   Light has difficulty reaching this narrow pathway that winds 
drunkenly through the slums, twists and bends marking the areas 
where it squeezes past the decrepit housing that is common in 
this now-decayed section of Osgiliath. Nevertheless, it meanders 
mainly north to south, trash ground into the packed dirt 
underfoot. The stench of close quarters is prevalent here, 
refuse and human filth mingling occasionally with a sweet whiff 
of westmansweed that seems to drift from somewhere to the west.

   Twisting jaggedly to the east and south, a dirt path crawls 
through this dark and unfriendly section of western Osgiliath. 
Buildings jut up to the west and north, turning their moldy and 
splintery-walled backs upon this trash-filled alley. Rodent eyes 
gleam occasionally in the shadows, and cockroaches skitter among 
the midden-heaps. The stench of closely-cramped human living and 
poor hygiene is powerful here, though an occasional breeze of 
fresher air drifts in from the east.

A Sharply Twisting Alleyway Bordering a Cliffside~
   This section of alleyway seems a bit more open than the rest 
of the slums, by virtue of the stunning view over a cliffside 
that provides a sharp and deadly-looking drop to the east. A 
low, rickety wooden fence provides dubious protection against 
those who would wander too close. The waters of the Anduin lie 
far below, and in the hazy distance, the opposite shore can be 
glimpsed on clear days. The grand structure of the Star Dome 
towers up to the southeast, and the covered Bele-Iant is clearly 
visible where it arches off across the rushing waters, an 
occasional barge or sailing ship gliding past. The alley itself, 
dingy and cramped compared to the vast view over the cliffside, 
continues north and westward.

   The thick city wall towers up to the east, its now moldy and 
crumbling stone still standing strong and immovable. It ends 
somewhat abruptly to the south, where the alleyway seems to open 
up a bit, fresher air wafting in occasionally. The pathway

move to the west. Underfoot is little but packed dirt, a few 
scraggly weeds sprouting up off to the sides.

A Sharp Bend in a Narrow Alley~
   This tiny dirt pathway twists suddenly, following the towering 
city wall as it slinks past the decrepit housing that fills this 
now run-down section of Osgiliath. The skitterings of vermin and 
other such unsavory alley creatures is often audible, mingled 
with shouts and clamor from the human residents of the slums. 
The city wall casts a shadow over the area even during the light 
of a clear day, and at night, the murky darkness is nearly 
tangible. The occasional scatter of trash lies across the path, 
but most of it is kicked out of the way, heaped by the walls.

skirting around its edges. The narrow trail continues eastward 
here, slinking alongside the towering city wall that stands 
stolidly to the north. Opposite the wall is a row of decrepit
houses, only one facing the pathway. Trash is kicked off to
either side, piled high against the walls, and rats scurry about, 
their eyes occasionally gleaming out from behind the heaps of 
filth and broken, useless objects.

road of Rath Earendil to the east. The sussurus of city sounds 
is somewhat muted here, though the occasional commotion splits 
through the air. The smell of closely cramped human quarters is 
notable to all but the most insensitive of noses, and often, 
mangy alley rats and starved-looking mutts can be seen slinking 
along the path, sniffing at the various heaps of midden piled to

A Tiny Square in the Midst of the Slums~
   The tiny alleyways open up into this rather small square, 
though the space remains large in comparison to the cramped, 
closely clustered atmosphere pervading the rest of the slums. 
Buildings hem the area in on all sides, narrow cracks between 
them indicating the twisting dirt pathways that split away to the 
north, west, and east. The way is blocked to the south by the 
back walls of moldy stone or wooden two-story townhouses, which 
must have been a glorious sight in their day. A lone, rather 
battered-looking doorway sits in one wall, trash piled up before 
it.

A Narrow Path Branching off a Square to the East~
   Just wide enough for a few people to walk side by side, this 
small alleyway seems to have once been paved with cobblestone, 
but is now mostly packed-down dirt and trash. The back walls of 
old, decaying stone and wood townhouses jut up to the north and 
south, blocking any hope of passage. Westward, the alley 
continues, winding slowly through the Osgiliath slums nd a small, 
shaded dirt square opens up to the east.

A Narrow Dirt Pathway~
   The pathway here is mostly packed dirt, with a few 
cobblestones visible here and there, hinting that it may have 
been paved at one time in the past. It squeezes through the back 
walls of buildings to lead further away from the quiet road of 
Rath Earnil, the tall but now-crumbling townhouses casting it 
into shadow for most of the day, and pitch darkness at night. To 
the east, it twists a bit around corners of houses, but stays 
relatively straight as it leads deeper into the slums. A door to 
the south provides access to a small shop.

A Cramped Dirt Pathway Crawling Through the Slums~
   This narrow street winds its way gently between ancient 
white-stone buildings that now serve as little more than a 
reminder of the dead glory of Osgiliath. The ground seems to 
have once been cobblestone, but is now packed dirt, with only a 
few rocks scattered about here and there. The smell of refuse 
and trash lingers stubbornly in the air, an unavoidable companion 
of the close, cramped quarters and sub-par housing.

A Bend in the Narrow Alleyway~
   Buildings in various stages of decay line this narrow pathway, 
which may have once been cobbled but is now covered with a thick 
layer of dirt and trash, only a few stones peeking through here 
and there. The alley itself bends gradually north and west as it 
meanders along, cast into shadow for much of the day by the 
crumbling stone and wood townhouses that line it. The quiet 
sounds of people drift by occasionally, especially off to the 
south, and now and then a door slams, or a voice calls out.

An Abrupt Dead-End in the Alleyway~
   The alley comes to a halt here, a tight corner between the 
tall, crumbling stone wall of an old dwelling to the north, and 
the relatively newer, strong wooden walls of other buildings to 
the south and west. The ground underfoot is little more than 
packed dirt, though a few cobblestones peek through here and 
there. Trash is piled up in a midden heap off to one side, and 
rats and mangy alley creatures are a common sight, adding to the 
already unsavory atmosphere of the Osgiliath slums.

An Old Stone House~
   The inner walls of this large white stone house have tumbled 
down over time, littering the cracked stone floor with rubble and 
rotted timbers. The occasional sign of a human occupant is 
visible, a filthy, tattered blanket lying in a small cleared 
space among the rubble. The ceiling is somewhat low, causing the 
tallest of men to be forced to duck, and a large, gaping hole can 
be seen where part of it has fallen out.

A Fragrant, Dimly-Lit Wooden Hut~
   This small hut has walls made of planked wood, hardy and 
nailed securely together with few gaps, but left unpainted and 
unstained. The ceiling is relatively high, and a small wooden 
ladder leads to a hatch above, presumably the living quarters of 
this shopkeep. The heavy scent of herbs, incense and medicinal 
remedies fills this shop, assaulting the senses immediately upon 
walking through the door, though it is arguably more pleasant 
than the stench of the slums beyond. Dimly lit by several 
torches within beaten brass sconces, the room has a cluttered, 
cozy atmosphere, satchets of herbs strewn over tables and 
countertops, and bunches of dried flowers hang from the ceiling.

A Busy, Run-Down and Cluttered Shop~
   This building is rather spacious and some care has gone into 
keeping it neat, as the floors are kept mostly free of dirt and 
debris. The windows set in the western wall to either side of 
the doorway look out upon a small, narrow road. Movement through 
the shop itself is cramped by several tables, piles of folded 
clothing, accessories, footwear, and other second-hand goods 
heaped thickly atop them all. Battered bronze lanterns are 
mounted on the walls, providing soft, flickering illumination to 
the shop during night and day. A counter stretches out across 
the back of the room, and behind its nicked surface, a metal 
ladder leads up toward a trapdoor in the ceiling.

An Abandoned Shopfront~
   The odour of stale beer greets you as you enter this small, 
empty storefront. The pine-plank flooring is stained and worn in 
places; dirty sawdust, used to mop up spills caused by the odd 
leaking barrel or cask, is strewn about the floor. Circular 
stains marr the floorboards where rows of casks and barrels used 
to be stored. A light layer of dust covers the counter and other 
flat surfaces in the room. A barred window allows daylight to 
sneak in and brighten the room, while a reinforced door set in 
the northern wall leads to the dirt pathway outside.

The Rath Celerdain Glassworks~
   This lively shop is the lower level of a two-story home. The 
walls and ceiling are newly built wood, stained a light golden 
color and still in very good shape. The floor is made up of 
alternating grey and blue tiles, a large, brightly patterned 
throw-rug just before the door providing a place for customers to 
wipe their feet. Several shelves and display cases are mounted 
on the walls throughout the store, each filled with bottles jars, 
goblets, plates, and other objects, as well as vibrantly colored 
works of art. Traffic through here is nearly continuous, and the 
noise level can get a little loud sometimes.

   Well-furnished but not lavishly so, this rather spacious 
backroom of the shop appears to be more geared toward working 
than, for example, for inviting company over. A large window set 
into the eastern wall peeks out a few feet before the view is 
interrupted by a wooden-walled building. A staircase runs along 
the northern wall, snaking its way upstairs, a second staircase 
leading downward beneath the first. A simple door sporting a 
fairly shiny lock leads westward to the shopfront.

A Dirt Alley Twisting Deeper into the Slums~
   Leaving behind the quiet bustle of Rath Earendil to the west, 
this narrow pathway eases between closely huddled buildings to 
slink deeper into decaying and decrepit housing. The dirt alley 
is relatively clear underfoot, most of the debris piled off to 
the side against the walls. Shadows sprawl across the area even 
at the height of day, and murky darkness descends early in the 
evening, lending it a rather dangerous, unsafe feel at most 
times. It widens very slightly to the north.

A Sharp Turn in a Dirt Alleyway~
   This alleyway runs south and east, taking a knife-edged turn 
around the corner of a building to the south. Bordering the 
northern way is a disheveled wooden house. Underfoot is packed 
dirt mingled with refuse, and above is a narrow sliver of sky, 
the rooftops of the slums resembling nothing so much as jagged 
teeth attempting to swallow what little light remains. The way 
widens off to the east, beyond some closely clustered shanties.

   None too clean, the packed dirt of this alleyway is mingled 
profusely with trash and other unsavory items. The stench and 
thick air of the slums weighs heavily on the senses, and rats are 
often seen scurrying about among the midden heaps piled against 
the southern walls. To the east and west, the pathway continues 
to snake its way through the Osgiliath slums. Northward, a large 
wood-framed archway allows access into an open-air shop.

A Small Intersection of Dirt Pathways~
   Splitting off in all directions save for the south, this 
intersection is a bit wider than the crooked alleways that extend 
away from it. It is relatively clean of trash, though the smells 
of the slums are still noticeable to most. A tall wooden 
building lies to the south, and decrepit housing borders the 
pathways in all other directions. Slight breezes of fresher air 
drift in occasionally from an easterly direction.

   The dirt pathway is rather trash-choked here and doesn't seem 
to see much traffic, besides that of vermin and other such 
unsavory alley life. It jig-saws slightly between corners of 
moldy stone and splintered wood buildings, moving generally east 
to west before cutting abruptly southward. The air is thick and 
heavy with the stench of refuse and waste, though any breezes 
coming in from the south seem oddly fresher, though any relief is 
quickly swallowed back up into the miasma of smells.

A Narrow Dirt Alley With a Stunning View~
   This section of alleyway seems a bit more open than the rest 
of the slums, by virtue of the stunning view over a cliffside 
that provides a sharp and deadly-looking drop to the east. A 
low, rickety wooden fence provides dubious protection against 
those who would wander too close. The waters of the Anduin lie 
far below, and in the hazy distance, the opposite shore can be 
glimpsed on clear days. The grand structure of the Star Dome 
towers up to the northeast, and the covered Bele-Iant is clearly 
visible where it arches off across the rushing waters, an 
occasional barge or sailing ship gliding past. The alley itself, 
dingy and cramped compared to the vast view over the cliffside, 
stretches north to south.

A Narrow Dirt Alley West of a Sheer Cliffside~
   This narrow dirt path seems almost precariously narrow, 
bordered to the west by a tall wooden two-story building, but 
dropping sharply off to the east, nothing between a mis-step and 
the plummeting fall that would be sure to follow. The air is 
much fresher here, however, smelling of brackish water and the 
breeze, and the view is expansive, the rushing river visible far 
below. The towering majesty of the Star Dome rises a distance to 
the northeast, spanning the rushing river waters. On clear days, 
the opposite shore of the Anduin can be glimpsed, and 
occasionally, the white sails of a ship will glide past below, 
heading beneath the covered expanse of the Bele-Iant, toward the 
docks to the south of the city. The pathway itself comes to an 
abrupt end at a stout wooden door to the south, and winds 
northward along the cliffside.

A Small, Dingy Living Room~
   An obvious attempt has been made to make this room hospitable. 
The cracked and stained plaster on the walls has been patched and 
an attempt made to hide the stains with a thin coat of dingy, 
beige paint. A large, worn wool rug covers the scratched and 
creaky floorboards. The room appears to be used for an eating 
and sitting area, a few worn pieces of furniture neatly arranged 
where space allows. A small window has been boarded over with 
odd sized pieces of pine lumber, securely held in place with 
numerous iron nails. Someone has hung a faded blue curtain over 
the boards, in an attempt to conceal them. 
   A steeply angled, creaky staircase leads upstairs to a small 
loft while a solid wooden door set in the southern wall leads out 
to the alleyway.

   The pathway weaves crookedly along from north to south, 
straightening out as it eases past the broad archway leading to 
an open building to the west, strings of clay beads that serve as 
a curtain clattering quietly in any breeze. The packed dirt 
underfoot has been trampled until it is hard enough to rival 
stone, and it seems relatively trash-free, though stains of 
various unidentifiable substances are visible here and there. 
Rats and other alley life often slink unobtrusively through the 
shadows cast by the decaying, once-grand buildings, picking at 
the occasional scrap of rotted food or bone.

a midden heap that is piled in the northwestern corner.

   Knee-high mounds of refuse are piled on either side of the

The overwhelming stench of rotting household waste assaults the 
senses. Only those forced to toil here dare linger longer than 
absolutely necessary as they haul and dump cart loads of refuse, 
piling them on top of the muckheaps. The rusted-gate leading out 
into the cramped alleyway to the west is watched over by the 
scruffy looking muckheap keepers that spend their time sorting 
through the newly dumped refuse, pocketing any valuable items 
that find their way to the muckheaps.

various other sundry and pottery supplies arranged on its shelves

strings of beads that are hung in the wide archways set in the

bronze oil lamps hanging from the ceiling. An incense burner 
sits on the countertop, a stick constantly burning within to add

to have been freshly covered with a coating of beige paint. The 
worn floorboards sport a new coat of dark-brown stain and are 
covered by a large, slightly-worn, burgundy wool rug. While the 
outside of this two story home appears rundown and dingy, it is 
clearly evident that some care has been given to upgrading the 
interior. A glass-paned window set in the southern wall looks 
onto the dirt alleyway outside. Heavy, brown linen drapes can be 
drawn to keep the light out or provide privacy for those 
sheltering inside. Several, strategically placed wall sconces 
bathe the room in a soft light when lit. A creaky, narrow 
staircase provides access to the upper floor of the home and a 
sturdy, reinforced wooden door to the south leads out into a dirt 
alleyway.

Clinging To A Vine-Covered Stone Wall~
   The decaying state of this stone wall provides several natural 
hand and foot-holds, and the profuse growth of vines both helps 
and hinders a would-be acrobat. Far above is the stone railing 
of a balcony, and below is the hard packed dirt and mingled 
refuse of the alleyway. Provided one doesn't slip and fall, it 
should be fairly easy to climb up or down.

A Small Apartment~
   This small dwelling is cramped but comfortable. The room is 
modestly decorated though the plaster on the ceiling and the 
walls is cracked with age and crumbling in spots. The floor, 
while scuffed and worn with use, is remarkably clean. In one 
corner stands a stove, the ceiling above and the wall behind 
permanently blackened by years of soot, though bearing signs of 
unsuccessful attempts to clean them. Alongside the stove, a set 
of shelves are mounted against the wall. On the other side of 
the room, a bed and wardrobe are positioned against the wall 
while in the center of the room rests a small table.

set in sconces evenly spaced along the walls. A few bookshelves

two of the candle sconces, bathed in light. Sturdy chairs finish 
off this sitting room and study area. Doors made of teak are set

   This small yet comfortable room is made of the same stone 
floor and whitewashed masonry walls than the rest of the clinic. 
A small, narrow window lets in light through the day, and permits 
air to flow freely when opened. A glass lamp on the northen wall 
permits illumination at night. This room is mostly silent and 
calm, allowing rest and reflection. A small, teakwood door to

A Large Warehouse~
   Well-swept and lively, this room's spacious area is given an 
almost cavernous feeling by the vaulted ceiling, almost the 
height of two men. Well-lit by a number of windows high on the 
northern, eastern, and western walls, the room is visible end- 
to-end throughout the entirety of the day. Although a number of 
crates are piled throughout it, they are generally stacked 
straight and neat, lending the place an orderly feel. In the 
center of the room, a thick granite column sprouts from the 
stained pine floorboards, and doors set in the northern, 
southern, and western walls allow egress in those directions. A 
railed balcony is set into the southern wall above the door.

wooden building, and downward, obviously, lies the cold, 
unyielding floor of the storehouse.

   Over fifteen feet above the storehouse floor below, the roof- 
supporting column of the building comes close to the rafters of 
the ceiling, allowing one to climb up onto them with general 
ease. Though not spacious or comfortable by any means, the 
rafters provide a quick route to the windows on the northern, 
western, and eastern walls. A small wooden platform has been 
stretched across the rafters here, providing safe footing near 
the centre of the complex.

lending the space a little more color than the main floor. 
Though small, the room provides ample space for movement and to

A Large, Flat Rooftop~
   This rooftop's flat surface consists of red-stained wooden 
planks, making a long, broad rectangular surface on which one 
could walk if they wished. The rooftop is rather plain and 
bland, with little in the way of variation. Over the edge on the 
north side is the gate to the third circle. Over the edge to the 
west, a small hop to a lower roof lies. Visible over the edges 
of the southern and eastern edges is a small alleyway, snaking 
between buildings and the wall of Minas Tirith.

Alleyway Snaking Between Buildings~

possibly two passersby moving through it on their daily tasks. 
Though cramped and dismal, the alley is not dirty not much in the 
matter of refuse lies in the path, though the occasional vermin 
or stray animal may pass through. A narrow gap between the 
warehouse and the wall allows one passage northward, to a busy

and the stone wall of Minas Tirith to the south. Though little 
in the matter of refuse or trash lies in this path, the 
ivory-cobbled alley is teeming with an abundance of dirt, so much 
so that the path seems to simply become a well-beaten dirt path 
in places. A low window is visible on the northern wall, though 
it does not budge.

UNUSED A Reading-Room Turned Personal Quarters~
   Although the room is rather spacious in and of itself, much of 
this space has been consumed by various sets of bookshelves and 
desks. Apparently a former reading room, the rear of the chamber 
has been converted into a makeshift if cozy set of living 
quarters. Warmly carpeted and lit gently by lanterns set into 
sconces on the ancient stone walls, the room is steeped in 
silence and tranquility - perfect for study or contemplation.

UNUSED A Spacious Map-Room Turned Dormitory~
   The center of this spacious stone chamber is filled with 
numerous desks and chairs to aid in the study of the 
once-formidable collection of maps and scrolls housed here. The 
perimeter, however, has been cleared to make room for a number of 
bunks, tables, chairs, and other such items, hinting at the 
room's current use as a student dormitory. A bit drafty due to 
its imposing size, the floor has been carpeted for warmth, and 
bronze lanterns have been inset into recesses in the walls to 
provide ample illumination for study. A wooden screen has been 
installed in the far corner of the chamber to provide scant 
privacy when necessary for the students who live here.

A Refurbished Stone-Walled Backroom~
   Though the smells suggest otherwise, visually this room looks 
as if it were brand new. The clean floors have recently been 
swept and the walls, save for the westernmost one, have all had 
stained cedar timbers places over them, lending the room a warm 
and inviting look. Doors lead west and north and a long strip of 
clean red linen serves as a curtain to the east. A patterned red 
rug has been thrown over the floor, adding a touch of decoration.

this kitchen is kept nearly immaculate. Shelves and cupboards

of cooked and overcooked foods are etched into the timber of the 
wall paneling. A long, red strip of linen serves as a curtain to

center, allowing it to be pulled up easily.

egress, and a metal ladder leads upwards to a trapdoor in the

stone here, as are the smells of ales and cooked meat.

A Rundown and Dimly Lit Entry Hall~
   This large hall still bears a few tattered vestiges of its 
former glory, in the form of some faded tapestries decorating the 
grey stone walls, and a large, fringed rug that is now threadbare 
and covered with a crusty layer of tracked-in muck. Smoke-marks 
mar the walls where torches flicker dimly in their sconces, 
keeping the area fairly well lit no matter the time of day. The 
smell of roasting meat and burning wood wafts in through a large 
archway set in the western wall, adding a heaviness to the 
already musty air. A chipped marble statue occupies the 
northeastern corner of the room, and a creaky wooden staircase 
laboriously winds its way upward.

   This tall marble statue probably cost a small fortune when it
was new, depicting a volouptuous, almost naked female form. She
is covered by a flowing scarf arranged in strategetic locations,
and her hair is pulled into a loose bun at the nape of her neck.
Her softly rounded features are covered in a fine layer of dust,
and the tip of her nose is chipped off. Spidery cracks mar the
grey-veined white marble of her form in many places, and one arm
is broken clean off at the shoulder. The other arm is outstreched
in a gesture of beckoning, which only serves to display the lack
of a few fingers.

   These tapestries depict various battle and hunting scenes,

shining ringmail, the man's mouth forming a silent, shouted
challenge. The orc is clearly losing, a beam of light glowing
brightly behind the human figure.

vestiges of its former glory, apparent in the fresh coat of 
off-white paint covering the solid stone walls and the obvious 
effort made to clean and smooth the ancient wooden floorboards, 
which nonetheless creak loudly underfoot. The walls are thick 
and unyielding, but various sounds and smells from the outdoors 
still drift through the area, along with an everpresent smoky, 
musty smell that lingers in the air. Set into the wall here is a 
large keyrack, many tarnished bronze keys hanging from hooks of

   Thick, unforgiving grey stone makes up this spacious room, 
smoke marks licking along the walls and ceiling. A large portion 
of the floor has been chipped away into a firepit, which is 
stained with a thick layer of soot and ash. A large window 
interrupts the monotony of the northern wall, curtained with 
tattered, stained red linen and barred with vertical rods of 
steel. A broad archway to the east leads toward an entry hall, 
and sturdy if somewhat battered doors are built into the western 
and southern walls.

A Spacious, Musty Stone Room~
   This spacious room looks large enough for several sizeable 
pieces of furniture, but that is perhaps its only virtue. The 
walls and ceiling are made of dreary, moldy grey stone, and the 
only window is a small, barred opening near the ceiling, which 
barely serves to let in enough light to see by during the day. 
The wooden panelling of the floor is now gouged and splintered in 
many places, and is oddly lighter in some spots, as if large 
fixtures had been removed after being there for some time.

   Smelling vividly at any particular moment of a mixture of 
Westmansweed and woodsmoke, this room's spacious, rectangular 
form could provide enough space for two people and some larger 
pieces of furniture with relative ease. Aside from the smell, 
the room's most notable feature is, ironically, its lack of 
features. The four drab and crumbling stone walls seem nearly 
identical to one another. The ceiling and floor are both made of 
worn, scratched, and stained old timbers of an unknown type. 
Save for the door in the northern wall, there are no windows or 
other exits.

   This room smells faintly of burnt meat and woodsmoke, the 
scent seemingly imbued into the hard grey stone of the walls and 
ceiling. The floor underfoot is creaky wooden panelling, 
splintered in many places. There is a lone, small window high on 
the wall near the ceiling, letting in a scant amount of light 
during the day. Suspicious looking rusty-red stains mar the 
floor near the doorway, and the air is somewhat stifling, but the 
room itself is fairly large, providing plenty of space for a few 
sizeable pieces of furniture. Noises and clamor filter in

the wooden staircase tucked into the northern part of the room. 
The stone walls are ancient but still strong, hinting at the past 
glory this structure must have held. The high wooden ceiling is 
cast into shadow at all times of the day, but especially at 
night, and the creaky floorboards beneath are covered only 
partially by a long, woolen carpet runner that has been beaten 
into a muted, dusty green shade. Light is provided by a quintet 
of torches in sconces: two on the west wall, two on the east, and 
one on the north wall, near the staircase's railing.

A Spacious Suite With Faded Tapestries~
   This room was obviously well crafted from stone but now bears 
the signs of many years of wear and tear. In places the stones 
are starting to come loose and remain there only by virtue of 
some crumbling plaster patching, but overall, the room is in 
decent condition. Hung upon the walls and covering the worst of 
the damage are several tapestries, somewhat worn but of obvious 
quality. They also serve to insulate the room further against 
the weather and sounds of the surrounding tenement, though muted 
shouts and noises are still clearly audible. A wide archway, 
curtained with swaths of stained burgundy linen, leads into the 
adjoining room to the west.

The ceiling, though it is cracked and chipped, bears evidence of 
expertly crafted masonry and might have been considered beautiful 
in times past. The area is joined to another to the east via a 
large, burgundy-curtained archway, and on the northern wall, a 
small, grimy-paned window overlooks the street. There were other 
windows set into the western wall at one point, evidenced by the

   The stones that make up this hallway are solid and may have 
once formed the bones of a grand and glorious structure; now, 
they are chipped, smoke-stained, and covered with mold, and the 
air is musty and stale. A single threadbare tapestry provides 
the only remaining decoration along the southern wall, in a 
slight recess just before the steep staircase twisting its way 
upward. The only window is in the southern wall, and though 
sizeable, has been boarded up firmly. Light is provided only by 
the guttering, smoky torches casting their feeble but warm light 
over the grey stone of the hall. A steep stone stairway leads 
upward to a third floor, darkness shrouding the area above.

crumbling but functional masonry. A few faded wall-hangings are 
tacked up over the north and west wall, serving the dual purposes 
of warding off cold, and adding some touches of color to the 
otherwise bare room. The floor is undecorated, being simple 
wooden planking, creaking and splintery with age. The room is by

opposite, but it does offer some measure of seclusion and

likewise, are all the same color - though it is hard to pinpoint

   While roomy enough, this room's drab stone walls can't seem to

are all a mostly-uniform grey stone, spotted with the occasional 
speckles of some ancient whitewash, the floorboards and ceiling 
are a riot of colors, ranging from a pale near-white to a 
richly-stained apparent mahogany, and the room even has its very

been covered haphazardly with a dirty brown rug. A window is set 
into the northern wall, offering light and a rather grand view of 
Osgiliath's northwestern side.

A Drab But Spacious Suite-Room~
   This room was obviously well-crafted, though it now bears the 
signs of many years of wear and tear. In places it appears that 
stones have come loose and been replaced in a shoddy manner and 
in others wood supports are visible within gaping holes in the 
stone, but overall the room looks to be in decent condition. 
Hung upon the walls and covering the worst of the crumbling 
masonry are several tapestries, somewhat aged and worn but 
obviously of quality craftsmanship. An adjacent balcony is 
accessable to the west, the archway hung with a thick curtain to 
provide a measure of privacy. The only window that exists in the 
northern wall is now boarded over from the outside, the remnants 
of broken glass panes still clinging to the frame on the inside.

A Spacious Balcony Overlooking The Slums~
   This balcony is a rather rare sight amongst the skyline of 
this part of the ancient city of Osgiliath. Though such 
balconies as this might have once been very common throughout the 
entire city, this one seems to be the only remaining one of its 
kind in the slums. Regardless of its age, the stonework is 
obviously of good quality and besides scattered signs of wear and 
tear the balcony is in good repair overall. In stark contrast to 
the balcony's appearance is the view below. Western Osgiliath 
lies sprawled below the balcony's weathered stone. Directly 
below the balcony lies the sprawling extent of the slums, while 
to the south can be seen the southwest part of the city, 
including the Coach and Hall Tavern, and behind it the 
Osgiliath's Farmer's Market.

A Small, Cozy Back Room~
   Though compact in size, this room's small stature gives it a 
quaint, cozy nature. The sounds and smells of Osgiliath are 
easily heard in here, as a stone-framed, shuttered window is set 
into the eastern wall. The walls of this room all share a 
similar quirk: long, wispy trails of black are singed into them, 
painting a picture of a previous intense flame in the room. The 
rest of the room, however, bears no witness to this occurence, as 
the floorboards and ceiling all look recently-replaced, and 
underfoot is a thick if faded blue woolen rug.

Shabbily-Kept Living Quarters~
   This small room is rather smoky, though well-lit in the 
daytime, through a large window in the eastern side. The wooden 
floorboards are warped with age, and creak in several places. 
Random garments are scattered throughout the area. The sketches 
of several nude women are tacked to one wall, with an 
illustration of a naked man just above them. At night-time, the 
moon shines through the large window, casting the room into dim 
shadow. Underriding the scent of Westmansweed is that of 
unwashed bodies.

The Open Second Floor of an Old House~
   Once covered by a high, vaulting roof, a few splintery wooden 
beams above are all that remain, leaving this crumbling second 
floor open to the elements. The stone of the walls and floor has 
grown a cover of thick moss and mold, and vines have even taken 
root in some places, growing profusely to cover the dull, dark 
grey stone in vibrant, glossy green. Part of the wall has 
tumbled away, and a large, gaping hole in the floor makes it 
necessary to watch one's step up here.

Inside A Crude, Burlap Tent~
   The tumult of the selling commons can be heard through the 
thin, waxed burlap walls of this boxy tent, which is roomy enough 
for several people to stand in at once. A large stall has been 
set up in the back, shanks of still-bloody meat strung up on 
sturdy wooden poles, and cuts of meat dripping fluids onto the 
dirt-packed floor from their space on the countertop. A dented 
tin lantern dangles from a crossbeam, swaying gently whenever the 
tent is shaken by strong winds.

with the coming of night, though trade still continues. The space
is roomy enough for several people to stand in at once, and a
dented tin lantern provides a soft, yellow glow to illuminate the

stand is nonetheless cluttered and filled with all sorts of 
cooking sundry and spices. The air is pungent with herbs and 
other less pleasant-smelling substances, and noisy with the

small area is relatively devoid of any decoration with only a few 
wall sconces visible, providing ample lighting for the area. It 
is clearly evident this hallway and the rooms beyond were 
recently built onto the workshop and storefront to the west. The 
condition of the wood and fittings show little sign of wear and 
tear. Cedar doors set in the walls provide egress to various 
rooms. A sturdy door set in the west wall leads out into the

UNUSED A Cramped Backroom~
   This long, rectangular backroom has a rather low ceiling, and 
is fashioned entirely of decaying stone, slick with moss and 
grime. A small array of columns line each of the walls, their 
tops arching upward to meet at an apex in the curved ceiling. 
Benches are pushed up against the northern and southern stretches 
of the room, next to empty shelves. The cold, dank atmosphere of 
the enclosure is accentuated by its dim lighting, tinted green by 
the old windows and verdant lichen that clings to the stones.
   A small oaken door to the east leads out into a larger room
of similar construction.

The Interior of the Stables~
   A door to the east permits entrance to this open, wood-beamed
room, lit by a series of lanterns set into its western wall.
Wooden stalls line either side of the stables, their floors
padded with freshly-strewn hay. The northwestern corner is
dominated by sacks, bushels and barrels of varying sizes.
Troughs run alongside the individual stalls, nailed to their
borders firmly.
   Broad, oaken doors to the north and east lead out into
adjacent rooms.

UNUSED A Spacious Office~
   This roomy office is a fine establishment, its walls and 
floors wood-paneled, and its celing lofty. Light spills in 
during the day from a series of windows that dot the northern, 
eastern and southern walls, and at night from a series of sconced 
lanterns on either end of the room. Wooden furniture dots the 
room sparsely, set over a series of fine fur rugs. The room is 
painted, for the most part, a rich burgundy, accented buy touches 
of gold and silver. A number of paintings hang from the walls, 
depicting various scenes of a white-walled city, and moments of 
battle. 
   A carved, well-decorated pinewood door leads out into the main
room to the west.

Concealed Room~
   This small room's main feature is a large, spiral staircase 
that leads up onto the roof of the building. It looks like this 
room is also used for storage, a few crates and boxes are stacked 
along the floor and makeshift shelving has been affixed to the 
wall. Those suffering from clausterphobia would find the cramped 
quarters extremely uncomfortable. A layer of dust covers the 
objects in the room, suggesting it is rarely used. A latch and 
the faint outline of a small door can be seen in the northern 
wall.

comfortable place to relax and socialize. Several strategically

An Underground Brewery~
   A massive, meticulously maintained brewery has been built into 
the earth here. The walls, carved out of solid rock and earth, 
have been panelled with stained oak planks that help the room 
retain the hot, humid atmosphere required for the trade performed 
here. A simple shaft carved into the wall, which disappears 
after many feet, offers the room's only ventilation. The floor 
is inset with smooth, neatly arranged stone flags with a large 
drain in the center of the room for excess water or spillage to 
be mopped into. Several thin stone columns, with a small ivy 
pattern engraved on their surface, stretch from the smoothed 
floor to the ceiling and ensure structural integrity. 
Meticulously maintained, it looks as though this room is kept as 
clean as possible with what some might consider compulsive care. 
A sturdy door, set in the eastern wall, leads out into the 
storage room.

   This hallway runs northwards from the main Osgiliath gate 
complex, ending in a set of heavy, iron-braced wooden doors. The 
floor is bare stone, chipped in some parts from heavy foot 
traffic as armored men pass through. Torches flicker softly from 
wall mountings, keeping the hallway lit at all hours. The walls 
are smooth stone as well, bare and drab, except in the northern 
wall, where symmetrical holes along both sides of the door seem 
to go through into a room to the north. A light layer of dust 
covers the corners and the walls.

and stone. The walls and floor are a mismatch of red brick and a 
patchwork of rough grey stone. An oaken door with a barred 
window is set into the eastern wall, thick iron hinges still 
gleaming from fresh paint. To the south, shoring timbers reveal 
an extension of the corridor, widening towards a set of 
double-doors.

the walls, depicting scenes of battle and valor, though some are 
too damaged to make out much detail. The recent use has left 
marks in the carpet.

An Eroding War-Room~
   The methodical assault of time has been aided in this room by 
anonymous misfortunes, leaving the once smooth walls pock-marked 
by cracks and craters. Missing bricks further mar their surface, 
leaving sunken pits of charred mortar to emphasize the room's 
already rough textures. Cracks spread through almost all the 
blackened stones, releasing the dusty scent of fire and death. 
It's former purpose forgotten, it now serves as a war-room. The 
furnishings and surfaces made a place of meetings and 
conversation. Elsewise, this room is tomb-like, and its stone 
floor uneven from untold stresses on its foundation. Maps are 
splayed out over the walls, covering entire lenths. Pins are 
placed at various areas, denoting troops and troop movemenets. 
There is usually at least one officer here, poring over the maps.

A Spacious Meeting Room~
   A large, open meeting room unfurls here, the marble floor 
draped in a series of soft, hand-woven carpets, rich with a full 
tapestry of color. Benches, beautifully carved, are set against 
the western and southern walls, beneath broad bay windows, rimmed 
in polished bronze. Chairs and other fine furniture are 
positioned about the space, cushioned and well-decorated. 
Sculptures, paintings and other detailed artwork is set about the 
enclosure, including an impressive portrait of an armor-clad 
warrior hung on the southern wall, boxed in by a massive, 
gold-leafed wooden frame. 
   A large, carved, wooden door permits entry to the Emporium to 
the north, a thick door with a brass knob to the west leads to a 
side room, and a small oaken door to the east leads out into 
another room.

The Emporium Shop~
   This room contains a single, long burnished mahogany counter, 
set before a line of cherry-wood shelves and cabinets. 
Glassware, rolls of linens and other fine goods have been placed 
on display within the cabinets, each set out with an air of 
singular importance. The shop is nicely lit during the day by a 
series of glass-paned windows high in the arch of the vaulted 
ceiling. A candelabra hangs in the center of the room, providing 
an ample, if orange hued light at night. The entire room has 
been luxuriously paneled with polished cherry-wood. 
   A small mahogany door has been set between the cabinets behind 
the counter, inset and made to blend with the wood-paneled walls.

UNUSED A Cozy Attic Lounge~
   Accessed via a set of steep wooden stairs, this quaint lounge 
seems rather cozy. The flooring appears to be made of stained 
mahogany, heavily lacquered to protect its finish. The walls are 
stained a rich, deep umber, which would give a dark feel to the 
entire room, were it not for the two large bay windows that look 
out over Rath Gil and the private housing beyond. The space is 
softly lit, when daylight wanes, by several bronze wall sconces. 
An impressive marble fireplace dominates the northern wall while 
a richly stained bar dwells in the far southern corner of the 
room. The atmosphere and patrons that frequent the lounge are 
more decorous than that of the busy commons and main gathering 
room situated downstairs. There is a sturdy door set in the 
eastern wall and a set of steep stairs provides egress to the 
hallway of the floor below.

   Basic in design but functional, this large room is dominated 
by an iron forge in the center. Several long rectangular windows 
are set high into the wooden walls, poles extending forth to 
allow them to be opened or closed. The floor is bare dirt, only 
the ground directly underneath the forge made of stone. A metal 
shaft extends from the forge, disappearing into the ceiling, 
apparently serving as a chimney.

   This large kitchen has clearly seen much use over the years, 
the walls and floors constructed from old, worn cedar timbers. A 
fairly fresh coat of whitewash has been applied to the walls, in 
an obvious attempt to brighten the place. The finish of the 
floorboards has been worn away, from years of scrubbing and wear. 
Though well used, the kitchen is kept immaculately clean and 
organized. A series of shelves and racks lines the walls, 
displaying a wide array of kitchen utensils. A large glass-paned 
window looks out onto a small kitchen garden. The trapdoor set 
in the floor leads down into the storage cellar while a door set 
in the northern wall leads out into the main tavern room.

shelving provides extra storage space for jars and bottles. The 
walls, ceiling and flooring are all fashioned from worn, cedar 
planks. A small stone staircase leads back up to the kitchen.

   This room is rather simple in appearance and design. The 
walls and ceiling are made from worn, yet sturdy-looking cedar 
timbers which look to have been recently painted a pale yellow. 
When the sun is present, filtered light streams into the room 
through a curtained window set into the northern wall. A brass 
lantern is bolted deep into the timber of the walls, adequately 
lighting the room when night falls. The muffled sounds of 
voices, laughter and the occasional drunken yell can be heard 
coming through the floorboards from the tavern's common room 
situated below. A heavy, cedar-plank door is set into the 
southern wall, providing egress into the hallway.

to allow for many people to mingle inside it easily as they wander
through the shop's selling floor. There is very little on display
here, most of it being behind the large counter against the south
wall where purchasing takes place. The air smells faintly of smoked
meat, but the floor and walls are scrupulously clean. A door leads
outside, with another to the south opening to the building's living
areas.

A Shrouded Pool in a Lush Parkland~
   The cool, clear waters of this silvan pond provide a welcome 
respite from the clamor and crowd of the surrounding village. 
Perhaps ten meters in diameter, this sizeable pool is ideal for 
swimming and recreation during Osgiliath's temperate spring and 
summer seasons, and as a result is a frequent stop for many. To 
the south rises the grassy shore of the parkland, and to the 
north various flora have taken root, beyond which rises 
Osgiliath's northern city wall.

The Bottom of a Shrouded Pool~
   Almost completely clear, the pristine waters of this parkland 
pond are tranquil, sweet and cool. The bottom of the pond is 
home to countless stones, smoothed by the ages, and a number of 
plants, fallen trees, and other such bits of history. In 
addition, every so often a glint of metal may be seen here or 
there, perhaps testament to a coin tossed into the silvan pond 
for good fortune, a common custom among Osgiliath's working folk.

Twisting Hand-Dug Tunnel~
   Leading from north to south in a twisting, turning way, the 
course of this hand-dug tunnel diverting slightly whenever 
anything such as solid rock or age-old masonry pokes out from the 
dark earth. The passage through the underground is rather wide, 
the base of this tunnel having been well padded down and solid 
wooden timbers used to prop up the walls and roof against 
collapse. To the north, the path twists onwards and at a slight 
ascent, while to the south a plank of wood has been crudely 
strapped across the tunnel.

Hand-Dug Tunnel Descending Southwards~
   As this trail leads southwards, it descends at a irregular 
rate, the tunnel twisting and veering sharply through its journey 
deep under the ground. Still, stale air hangs heavily between 
the confines of the wide-set wooden support beams, the silence 
broken by little save the scurrying of rodents underfoot. The 
earthen walls of this tunnel bear the marks of shovels and picks 
upon them, the regularity of the work clearly placing them as 
having been dug through the use of basic tools, and some time in 
the recent past. To the north the tunnel ends, a small ceiling 
of loose cobbles set above it.

Small Common Room~
   Wooden planks form the walls and floor of this small common in 
the shack, the pine bearing a mellow tone. The ceiling slopes 
upwards to an apex in the center of the chamber, tiles place over 
the thick beams. A single, heavy door opens outwards from this 
shack, through which the faint sounds of Osgiliath filter in. To 
the south, a smaller alcove branches off, a sheet of heavy burlap 
positioned over the passageway.

Bedroom Alcove~
   Extending outwards from the main room of this spartan shack 
that lies beyond a burlap curtain, this small alcove is barely 
big enough for its furnishings and a few occupants. A tiled 
roof, its apex not too far overheard, houses a few silky cobwebs 
and rogue spiders, yet the rest of the area, its wooden walls and 
floors, seem free of dust, grime and bugs.

Upon the Tower Battlements Directly Above the City Gates~
   Fortified and stout, this tower stands as a sentinel directly 
above the city gates, allowing its defenders to keep a constant 
vigil over their city. There is a constant presence of soldiers 
and guardsman, keeping a wary eye at all times to the dangers of 
the east. Beyond the thick stone crenellations, far in the 
distance to the east, the black mountains lay, their snow topped 
peaks forming the impenetrable barrier into Mordor. Directly 
east from the city however, green farmlands grow, and beyond them 
a thick and green forest blankets the countryside.

Behind The Wooden Screen~
   A portion of the room has been blocked off from the rest of 
the bedroom. A section of wall, painted a soothing shade of sage 
green, is visible. A folding, wooden screen provides privacy and 
blocks the view of the rest of the room, allowing someone to 
dress or sleep in complete privacy. A section of lightly 
stained, pine plank floor is large enough to accomodate a single

barrels, casks and bottles. A layer of dust and cobwebs covers 
the other assorted tools and equipment displayed on shelving or 
arranged on the pine-plank floor. A barred and curtained window 
provides fresh air and brightens the space during the day. The 
strong smell of stale beer is almost overpowering when you enter 
the room. A sturdy door to the north leads out into the shop 
front while a narrow staircase provides access to the loft. A 
trapdoor sunk into the floor is edged with dust covered soot.

is comprised entirely of dark-red-stained timbers, recently 
replaced, which groan softly as they are tread upon. The floor

of the floor. To the north, a door leads further into the 
recesses of the shop, while another door leads back to the

fashioned of grey stone, as is the domed ceiling. A 
cedar-panelled floor runs underfoot, clean but often cluttered. 
A small, square window, bordered in bronze, permits light to 
filter into the enclosure during the daytime, while a series of 
sconzed lanterns provide illumination at night.

next to the desk are two large brass candelabras, each bearing a 
multitude of white candles. The only exit lies to the west,

   Well-trimmed and stately, this lawn is more than merely a 
shaded sward of grass. With enough room to comfortably occupy 
nearly thirty people, the lawn is sparsely but tastefully 
decorated with the occasional shrubbery and a pair of tall, 
stout, obviously ancient trees: one stands near the northern 
wall, and one near the southern, effectively extending shade over 
most of the lawn during all hours except noontime. 
   A stonework wall, flush with the building to the northwest, 
encloses the area here, twice the height of the average man.

even spaced throughout the grand hall and each expertly carved. 
Large, stained glass windows depicting a variety of images allow 
a good deal of light from without to enter the room, reflecting 
spashes of various colours across the highly polished, marble 
floor. Two crystal chandeliers are suspended from the ceiling 
above and several burning lamps hang from hooks in the walls. 
Adding further decoration to the walls are a number of brightly 
coloured tapestries and paintings creating an atmosphere of life 
and merriment.

Shadowy Alleyway Between Two Large Buildings~
   Cramped and quiet, this passage between two of Osgiliath's 
stone-walled buildings bordering it comes to an abrupt halt 
northward, where it ends at a large, two-story wooden fence. The 
sun is nearly blotted out, save for directly above, casting 
sinister shadows all about the alleyway. A stack of abandoned, 
dusty crates has been made here, long gathering dust in the dirt 
floor, cobblestones either long gone or never present.

   A winding pathway of white cobblestones curves from the busy

regular intervals. The traffic here is extremely limited, with 
only an occasional guard passing by. Birds are often heard 
chirping overhead, while to the west the River Anduin can be 
heard flowing between its banks, lending a peaceful atmosphere to 
the area.

An Unadorned Common Room~
   Simply stained panels line the unadorned walls of this common 
room on the first floor. An occasional resident crosses 
reservedly over the even, pinewood floor, but the room is 
typically calm and quiet enough to allow personal reflection or a 
subdued conversation to go on uninterrupted. Sterile and open, 
the space in this room is well-used, with few objects to 
interrupt the flow of light and air. A soft, though not 
extravagantly plush, rectangular rug lain out in the center of 
the floor adds a splash of rich burgundy color to the otherwise 
muted interior. A pale oak door set in the south wall leads out 
to a cobbled pathway, its doorframe made slightly conspicuous by 
a subtle, decorative ridge lining the edge. Doors of a similar 
stain are set into the north and west walls, and an alcove in the 
eastern wall houses a stairwell leading up to the second floor. 
A fireplace is set in the southern wall, next to the door.

A Sterile Dormitory~
   Long, simply-stained wooden panels stretch from the ceiling to 
the pinewood floor. The room is rather sterile, without any 
adornment save the brown-curtained window set into the western 
wall that overlooks the Anduin not far to the west. Though not 
cramped, this room is not large enough to hold much furniture, 
nor more than two or three people comfortably. A simple woolen 
rug, the same shade of brown as the curtains, is set before the 
pale oaken door that opens eastward into the common room.

A Sparsely-Furnished Dormitory~
   Long slats of pine wood, half a foot wide, run parallel to 
each other, stretching across the room, making the floor of the 
room. Stretching from the floor to the ceiling are wide wooden 
panels, slightly darker than the floor. A white rug is set in 
front of the door, while a matching set of white curtains adorn 
the window to the north. The room is rather bland otherwise, 
with only a few pieces of furniture occupying the space. A door 
of pale oak stands to the south, allowing egress into the common 
room of the building.

A Small, Pine-Walled Kitchen~
   Brightened during the day by warm sunlight spraying through a 
window in the southern wall, this cozy room is as close to a 
nexus of activity as can be found in this quiet building, 
frequently playing host to the sounds of cooking, eating, and 
pleasant conversation. The simply-stained pine walls are imbued 
with the olfactory evidence of many hearty meals prepared within. 
Along the eastern wall is an alcove housing a stairwell leading 
down to the first floor, and the pale oak doors on the north and 
west walls are in good repair. A chimney runs up the southern 
wall.

Lond Caras-Mir Approaching the Walls of a City to the North~
   Wide enough to bear two wagons side by side to each other upon 
it, the road of Lond Caras-Mir rarely sees such traffic in these 
times, the black-and-white pattern created by the cobbles in 
disarray with the numerous potholes in the path. An occasional 
guard patrol or a farmer bearing a cart full of goods for a city 
market is all the excitement the road sees now. The grass side 
by side the road grows high and untamed, and the gentle farmlands 
of Anorien can be seen to the north and west, the River Anduin 
flowing swiftly not far to the east. 
   A short distance to the north-east the walls of the city of 
Osgiliath can be seen as the city itself moves out east over the 
River Anduin.

Lond Caras-Mir Turns South and East~
   The strong walls of the city of Osgiliath, once the capital of 
Gondor, rise up a distance to the north-east, the city itself 
located over the running waters of the broad River Anduin. A 
slight, sporadic flow of farmers, vagrants and guardsmen walk on 
past on the wide road, giving little attention to much save 
themselves. To the south-west the White Mountains stretch off to 
west, disappearing over the horizon, while not far off the road 
to the east the western shore of the River Anduin lies. Closer 
off Lond Caras-Mir lies irrigated farmland and fallow fields. 
   To the south Lond Caras-Mir forms onto a straight path, while 
to the east it rises, sloping upward past two fortified towers to 
the gates of the city of Osgiliath.

Lond Caras-Mir Runs North and South, Parallel to the River Anduin~
   Lond Caras-Mir, the road that branches the distance between 
the ancient city of Osgiliath and the walls of the Pelennor 
Fields, runs through the countryside of Anorien here. Basalt and 
some type of white rock have been down side by side as the paving 
stones of the road, creating a contrasting pattern of light and 
dark that has been faded and worn away by time. Only a few 
people make their way along the road, the majority of them 
farmers, taking their wares to and fro the city and countryside. 
   The straight set course of the black-and-white cobbled road 
continues to the north and south.

road of Lond Caras-Mir rarely sees such traffic in these times,

   Lond Caras-Mir runs from east to west through the farmland of 
Anorien. To the west it approaches a large gate in white stone 
wall known as the Rammas Echor.

   Lond Caras-Mir, the road that branches the distance between 
the ancient city of Osgiliath and the walls of the Pelennor 
Fields, runs through the countryside of Anorien here. Basalt and 
some type of white rock have been down side by side as the paving

people make their way along the road, the majority of them 
farmers, taking their wares to and fro the city and countryside. 
   The Rammas Echor, the stalwart stone wall that protects the 
Pelennor Fields, lies to the west, a large wooden gate bound with 
iron bands set in it as the base of Lond Caras-Mir. Lanterns 
flank the road for a short distance here as it runs out to the 
east.

A Garishly-Painted Sideroom~
   The wooden walls of this wide sideroom have been neatly 
painted a deep, garish crimson in colour, and various pieces of 
comfortable, none-too-expensive furniture are set about the room. 
The smells of sweat and ale permeates the room, along with the 
oil of lanterns that keep it amply lit at all hours. A small 
fighting ring dominates the western wall, though it is kept roped 
off at most times. 
   An open, stylized archway leads eastward, and a curtain of 
beads leads southward, into a room smelling of far sweeter 
incense and perfume.

A Small, Mauve-Painted Lounge~
   There is little free space in this room, the majority of it 
taken up by the furniture present here. An old, beaten brass 
chandelier hangs from the center of the ceiling, casting light 
and shadow about the room. The smell of various cheap incenses 
and perfumes mingle with one another, adding a generally 
pleasant, if not strong, odor to the room. Several paintings 
hang from the walls, none of much artistic merit. The walls have 
been painted a gaudy mauve, splashes of pink here and there. 
   A stairway along the southern wall leads upward, while several 
strings of glass beads hung from the archway to the north allow 
easy egress in that direction.

on unseen currents. Doors have been set into the northern, 
western, and eastern walls.

   The sporadically mauve-painted walls of this room are hemmed 
close together, providing just enough room for, perhaps, three or 
four people. A large mirror dominates the northern wall, stools 
set before it, and a shelf between the seats and the reflective 
glass contains tray after tray of makeup and powder. Many cheap 
perfumes, as well as the faint trace of incense, assail the nose 
here. 
   A large curtain separates this room from the one to the east, 
while a solid door blocks it off from the room westward.

drift into the hall during the daytime, and a sconzed lantern to 
the west dimly illuminates it at night. A large, bronze knocker 
is set into the southern door.

   The walls of this musty chamber have collapsed inward, 
littering its edges with misshapen stones. The room is dim and 
rather cold, the stones of the walls being cool to the touch. A 
faint trickling of water can be heard when the chamber is silent, 
bubbling off in the distance. A series of piled stones lead up 
to a wooden trapdoor set in the apex of the chamber's ceiling, 
fashioned of thick wood, braced with iron. The air is dusty, 
scattered with airborn debris.

by side. It leads northward and southward, while a door is set 
into the western wall. A niche has been cut into the eastern 
wall, and a staircase leading upward has been built there. Where 
the landing would have been above, a large boulder has landed, 
blocking any access. Narrow scrapes run down the length of the 
corridor, etched into the bare floorboards.

   The centerpiece of this room was a large, ornate chandelier

it has smashed into the panelled floor and scattered glass and 
metal shards. The wood panels that cover all four walls have 
been stained to a rich, dark brown hue, but are marred by 
initials and crude knifed pictures. A torn tapestry covers the 
middle of the eastern wall, while some windows on the northern 
wall give a view of weedy gardens outside.

provides adequate space for the storage of various large pieces 
of brewing equipment, storage racks, vats, casks and barrels. 
The air is humid and warm in here, smelling strongly of yeast and 
various fermenting liquids. An opening in the southern wall

leading up through the roof. A bed is shoved nearby, and a 
rickety table occupies the rest of the remaining space. The 
floor is made of squeaky pine planks, while the walls are made of

Freshly plastered walls have been washed with a light layer of 
beige hued paint. The space is bathed in soft light cast off by 
a row of evenly spaced bronze wall sconces. Several bronze hooks 
affixed near the doorway, provide a place to hang cloaks and 
hats. 
   A stately door with a sturdy iron lock leads out to the front 
steps and down to the street below while a sliding, panelled door 
to the north provides access to a bedroom. The hallway travels 
further along to the east and leads into a living room.

eastern wall. Along the northern and southern walls, a slew of

   This refurbished room is basically a shopfront where various 
types of items are traded and assessed. Made out of simple stone 
walls, there seems to be no exit but for a door set on the 
western wall, fashioned of new wooden planks banded with iron. 
Apparently, the goods traded here are taken somewhere else after 
they have been bartered. A few crates and boxes are scattered in 
this room, in the process of being filled with several armors or 
weapons. Most of these items are ragged, broken or bloodied, 
possibly loot from fallen enemies. A rough wooden sign has been 
painted over the archway, a mound of coins depicted there.

iron grate, around which new masonry has been uncerimoniously

Long, Very Narrow Tunnel~
   This tunnel is extremely narrow, forcing anyone who goes 
through it to travel in single file. The walls are very smooth 
and the ceiling is almost high enough for a grown man to stand up 
straight, but not quite. It has clearly been hand-hewn. At it's 
northern end, it comes to a halt at a wood-panelled wall. There 
is a handle on one of the panels, making it possible to pull it 
in, and slide it across.

   This small kitchen is spacious enough for one person to

it serves its purpose with its various furnishings and equipment. 
The stove, caddycorner in the southeastern corner of the room, is

corners of the east side of this subterranean junction. A brick 
walkway continues north and south along the base of the west 
wall. Two man-lengths across the thin, flowing muck is a similar 
path on the south side of the east tunnel. It seems to slip 
under the murky depths not far beyond. Recessed in the arched 
west wall of this tunnel is a worn, iron-banded door, the bottom 
of which has a ragged gaping opening.

Wading Through a Filthy Sewer~
   This ancient Gondorian sewer passage begins to make a gentle 
slope downward here. Approaching the eastern extent, the pathway 
of bricks lining the base of the southern edge of the tunnel 
begins to slip below the surface of the pooling, malodorous 
water. Filthy water pours out of chutes that line the northern 
wall at relatively even intervals. To the east it appears the 
tunnel continues its descent, although the water does not seem 
to. A cool zephyr of wind can be felt from the west.

Swimming in the Fetid Waters of the Sewer~
   Solid footing is not at option in this segment of ancient 
sewer work. The ceiling closes in on this passage, as the tunnel 
continues to slope downward to the east. When the waters are 
calm a faint spiraling current can be felt; an indication that 
these waters are slowly draining down along the intended course 
of the tube. The ceiling in the center of this tunnel appears 
relatively dry, contrasting with the slimy appearance the rest of 
the stone walls seem to have.

A Completely Flooded Tunnel~
   The fetid waters completly fill this section of tunnel from 
top to bottom. The repulsive filth assaults the senses, burning 
the eyes and filling the nostrils. One might retch were it not 
for the overwhelming fear of what taking in a mouthful of the 
toxic water might do. Things occasionally brush against the body 
in the darkness here; a mixture of both waste debris and the 
small foul creatures that thrive in this offensive aquatic 
environment. The tunnel continues downward to the east, though 
even the most stone-willed find them turned back.

comforting setting to an otherwise ominous room. All seating in 
this area is set to face southwards where at the far end can been

Otherwise, the light from this room barely penetrates into the

This room is dark, yet the cold feeling seeping into the bones 
of all that set foot in here gives the notion that it is quite 
big. Set about the room in the gloom can be seen lumbering 
objects of wood and steel that would need closer inspection to 
define what they are used for. The only portion of this room 
that is lit is an area on the southern wall. The floor is sticky 
and smell slightly of decay, and where the light touches, one can 
see old, dried blotches of blood, as well as a few new puddles.

providing light during the daytime. Three doors are set into the 
walls of the chamber, to the west, north and south. A bronze 
peephole is set into the centre of the northern door, providing a 
limited view of the cobblestone street beyond. A slender 
staircase winds upward to a small trapdoor above, the polished 
railing lined by a band of hammered brass.

north, half-covered buy a tumbled stack of crates. Old, timeworn 
pieces of furniture have been set at odd angles about the room, 
nearly concealing a short doorway set into the room's western 
wall. A small footstool has been left in the attic's 
northeastern corner, above which sits a rectangular trapdoor, set 
with a large iron knob.

weather. A small curtained window set in the northern wall looks 
out into a small confined yard. Little occupies the stone floor 
of the sole, liveable room of this small house, only the most 
rudimentary pieces of furniture are scattered about. A trapdoor 
in the floor leads down into a root cellar while a solid oak door 
in the east wall opens out onto a narrow path.

A Narrow Path~
   This narrow path leads westward around the side of a small 
cottage situated to the north, providing access to another 
smaller stone cottage tucked further back out of the way. The 
path itself is hardpacked dirt and is lined on either side by 
tall shade trees. To the east lies a wide path that leads 
further into the graveyard.

   Some distance south of the Dome of Stars rests this tiny pier 
along a rocky part of the shore behind a row of buildings. The

sprout from nearly every inch. A small packed-dirt footpath 
leads eastward between buildings, its southern side flanked by a 
two-storey high fence.

Upon the Eastern Battlements Overlooking Ithilien~
   The original walls of Osgiliath are but a memory here. The 
remains of a watchtower are scattered about - crenelated sections 
of wall resting against twisted iron poles that once bore 
Gondor's banners proudly. Fire-scorched and destroyed, this 
section of wall leads northwards to a view of the barren, 
wind-blasted terrain of Northern Ithilien. Deserted villages and 
farming homesteads are visible in the distance.

UNUSED A Vault Turned Private Chamber~
   Stone walls curve away from the western door to form the 
boundaries of a large, circular chamber. Two iron-rimmed windows 
on opposite walls shed light into the enclosure during the day, 
and are set with a series of heavy wooden shutters. Furniture 
litters the spacious room, set near two fluted columns carved 
into the sweeping bulk of the southern wall. A cast iron stove 
is set into the eastern wall, its blackened stovepipe crawling 
upward through a space in the ceiling. A thin, rectangular door 
of black oak, bordered by bookshelves and cubbies once filled 
with tomes and scrolls, leads to another room to the north.

UNUSED A Well-Decorated Bedroom~
   The floor of this quaint bedroom is fashioned of fine, 
carpet-covered stone tile, a large square marble mosaic at its 
centre bringing color to the room. Two broad windows are set 
into the northern and eastern walls, providing ample light during 
the daytime. A fine tapestry hangs from a beam along the western 
wall, depicting the faded image of a mail-clad and crowned 
warrior lifting a blade to a bleak tower of dark slate. The 
furniture here is neatly arranged, providing more than enough 
room, and easy access to the black oak door to the south.

A Damp, Dew-Walled Chamber~
   A twisting iron staircase and curving walls of rock plunge 
into the depths of a small, moist-aired chamber, falling away 
from a square, marble mosaic above. The atmosphere is cool, and 
the room usually silent, save for the steady trickle of water 
barely discernable through the stone of the enclosure. Six 
columns surround the cylindrical room, bordering crumbling 
statues of men, their features worn beyond recognition.

   This room is small, though not too cramped. The walls are all 
of stone and rise high up into the ceiling, where there is a 
narrow chute that leads up towards the open air above. The chute 
is covered by a metal grille. In the middle of the room, though 
near to the southern wall, is a deep hole in the ground, the 
latrine obviously, with a wooden seat over the top of it, sanded 
down so as to be relatively smooth. A thick oak door separates 
the room from the hallway outside.

A Narrow Second-Story Balcony~
   Barely wide enough for a few flowerpots and pieces of outdoor 
furniture, this narrow balcony looks out over the refuse strewn, 
packed-dirt alley below. Though the view is somewhat lacking, 
the balcony gets a good amount of afternoon sun when the season 
and weather permits. A window ledge is affixed to the front of 
the dingy looking house, though no window exists here on the 
upper level. Several tall poles and a canvas tarp serve as a 
moveable canopy, providing shelter from the rain when fully 
extended. A sturdy door provides access to the upper floor of 
the home.

Amongst Stalls West of the Main Stables~
   Stalls radiate in three directions out from this extension of 
the main stables to the east. The floor of packed dirt is strewn 
with loose bundles of hay, and is cluttered by numerous crates 
and sacks of grain. The room is rather dim, lit by a coal-fired 
brazier in an alcove in the north-eastern corner. The atmosphere 
is one of an oppressive heat, and the air here bears a distinct, 
earthy smell. The stalls surrounding the room are fashioned of 
fine oaken panels, and are seemingly well kept.

A Small Below-Ground Pantry~
   Heavy planks of pine constitute the walls of this small 
subterranean pantry, the ground consisting of hard packed earth. 
It is only the slightest bit taller than a woman of average 
height, let alone a man, and it is certainly no more than a half 
dozen yards in either length or breadth. The floor of the 
kitchen above forms the roof, which throws an unhealthy amount of 
dust into this claustrophobic room's atmosphere when someone 
walks overhead. A small wooden stepladder provides the means of 
getting back up through the trapdoor leading to the kitchen.

a solid wooden door now laying on the ground. There is a small, 
terrace-style window on the southern wall which has a view of the 
top of a low building of some description. The outer walls are 
panneled with planks of lacquered pine wood, covering up the 
stone that constitutes the building's bulk. The floor is layed 
with a worn, heavily-scratched cedar, pock-marked with crush 
marks. The walls are, for the most part, completely unadorned, 
though daubed with dark-red stains depicting torture and 
beheadings.
