The Balchoth Variable~
a Balchoth variable soldier~
A Balchoth soldier variable is here.~
   Possessed of a swarthy complexion and brown eyes so dark as to 
only be a few shades, if that, lighter than the pupil, this 
warrior might be considered short by the standards of most men. 
Black hair spills from beneath a helm of bronze, and, inscribed 
upon the right upper arm, when not covered by more of the 
polished bronze which guards the warrior's flesh, is an arrow, 
pointing upwards from above the elbow to just beneath the 
shoulder. However many years they have seen, this warrior's arms 
and legs bear a number of tattoos, be they of animals, weaponry, 
stylized marks, or otherwise, and they are marked by the 
occasional scar, which, together with the focused look in their 
eyes and the grim set to their lips, marks out a lifetime of 
experience in war.

a grotesquely scarred uruk-hai~
An uruk-hai stands by the door, his face grotesquely scarred.~
   This sinewy orc has certainly seen his share of fighting, his 
face split with a number of deep, crisscrossing scars. His left 
cheek has been caved in by some mighty blow, giving him a truly 
grotesque look. He stands at easy by the gate, clearly 
unimpressed by the passers by. Nevertheless, an air of readiness 
makes it clear that he is more than willing to make a swift end 
to any troublemaker.

an one-eyed, stout female orc~
An one-eyed female orc occupies the stall, offering her wares.~
   Stout, short and charcoal-skinned, this orcish female sneers 
at those coming to her shop. She observes her cluttered stall 
vigilantly with her single reddish eye, the other one covered by 
a leather eyepatch. Two pointed ears poke out through the 
sable-colored, braided hair on either side of her round face.

A wee, yellow-skinned snaga crouches behind the counter.~
   This miserable looking creature is tiny even for one of his 
race, his thin limbs resembling sticks wrapped in yellowish, 
sagging leather. He keeps his head low, his gray eyes 
downturned, his movements quick and twitchy as he carries various 
goods through the shop.

an ebon-skinned, massive orc~
An ebon-skinned, massive orc is present, trading weapons.~
   For an orc, this one is a truly hulking specimen, bulging 
muscles and layers of fat granting him an impressivee girth. His 
skin is smooth and perfectly black, bearing a slight sheen as if 
permanently coered with sweat or oil, especially the dome of his 
hairless head. Dark eyes survey the shop alertly, measuring each 
of the customers with a calculating look.

A pot-bellied orc with slick hair stands behind the bar, serving food and drinks.~
   This small orc must have been lucky in his life, because 
without luck, he probably wouldn't have been capable of 
developing a belly this big. He seems even wider than he is 
tall, moving with a self-assure swagger and observing his 
surroundings with his beady eyes of the color of volcanic glass. 
A short crop of gray hair has been smoothed back atop his head, 
glistening with a greasy sheen.

a bald, battle-scarred orc~
A bald, battle-scarred orc stands here.~
   This orc is rather short even for one of his race. His 
strong, square jaw and a lack of any hair give him a martial 
appearance, only supported by number of scars marking his 
greenish-gray skin. Between the pair of bright-green eyes sits a 
nose that has been obviously broken more than once in past. 
Ugly, old scar marks the right side of his face, pulling the 
right corner of his blackish lips upwards and giving him a look 
of a constant crooked sneer.

A whip-thin, crippled orc offers some items for sale here.~
   Small and emaciated to the point where he seems to be barely a 
skeleton wrapped in leathery skin, this little orc watches his 
surroundings with a wary look in his bloodshot eyes. A sparse 
growth of dark hair falls into a bony face in greasy strands, and 
hair of similar color protrude from his prominent ears and 
nostrils. His left leg is twisted sickeningly above the knee, 
the limb hanging uselessly and forcing him to support himself 
with a crooked stick.

A variable mordorian orc enforcer is here.~
   Squat and dark-skinned, this is a fine example of a Mordorian 
fighting orc. It stands at attention rigidly, ever watchful, 
ever ready to crush someone's skull with one of the 
powerfully-muscled arms.

a ghostly-white orc with piercing red eyes~
A ghostly-white orc with piercing red eyes is here.~
   Reaching a height of roughly three and a half feet, the 
descent of this orc is evident in the sickly white skin clinging 
tightly to his corded and sinewy frame. While puny by comparison 
even to other blackbloods, a certain feral and menacing 
expression is evident even when he stands idle, suggesting he is 
tribal and extremely devoted to whatever cause or purpose he or 
others have chosen for him. Sitting in split and patchy tufts 
across his pitted and heavily-scarred scalp are mounds of greasy 
black hair, it further accents his warrior-like visage by 
revealing that on any part of exposed skin there is a wide 
variety of marring from the fangs and claws of beasts to various 
instruments of warfare.

an obese, black-skinned orc with a missing leg~
An obese, black-skinned orc with a missing leg is here, watching the entryway with evident aggrivation.~
   Having endured a tremendous amount of pain and suffering and 
strife, the product of all this misfourtune is a black-skinned 
orc which appears to have survived an eternity of warfare and 
lived to tell of it. Absolutely disgusting in appearance from an 
extended belly which encompasses perhaps his entire body if 
rolled into a ball, his lanky and flabby arms suggest he has not 
seen any rigorous exercise or battle regularly in quite sometime, 
despite all of this his eyes carry a certain predatory quality in 
those which have ended many lives. Reaching a height of nearly 
four and a half feet, he towers above most other yrkin and quite 
easily exceeds most an girth, giving him an imposing if not 
sluggish appearance. His black-skinned scalp is adorned with 
faint wisps of ivory-white hair, suggesting he has seen many 
winters.

A small disfigured orc watches over the doorway.~
   This orc is a tiny creature, twisted beyond recognition, his 
face brutally disfigured by a claw of some large beast. 
Nevertheless, he bears himself with an aggressive air, his lips 
forced apart into a perpetual sneer by the badly-healed scarring. 
Sparse growth of stringy hair falls into his face, partially 
covering the short stump that is left of his left ear.

   Slender and possessing very long limbs, this orc watches over 
his stall with a wary expression in his reddish eyes. His face 
and the uncovered skin bears several scars from past misfortunes, 
slashes of maggoty white across his light-gray skin. An unruly 
crop of short-trimmed black hair rises from the top of this orc's 
misshapen head.

a cobalt-skinned, white-haired orc~
A cobalt-skinned orc with a mane of white hair is here.~
   Relatively tall and stoutly-built, this orc bears marks of 
being accustomed to war. Despite his shoulders slouching in a 
hunch, his lengthy and sinewy limbs and physique show a primitive 
and savage strength, further accentuated by the countless scores 
of scars littering the dark blue flesh wrapped tight across his 
body. Set with a gaping maw which is lined with yellow and brown 
teeth, the canines themselves appear to have been replaced with 
metallic fangs composed of bronze or copper, they amplify an 
already feral visage. Sitting as a wild frenzy atop his head is 
a shock of white hair, forming a bristly mane which surrounds his 
otherwise hairless facial features.

Quick miniscule snaga ritualistic scarring CA byCeredir~
a miniscule snaga with ritualistic scarring~
A miniscule snaga with ritualistic scarring is here.~
   Tiny - that is the first word to come to mind when looking 
down at one of the smallest kind of orkish races. Clearly under 
three feet in height, this little creature has both speed and 
strength evident in the broad musculature of his puny breed. 
Bone-white skin has been scarred and scorched in what appears to 
be ritualistic procedures, almost all of them bearing some 
symbolic reference to arachnids. From tattoos to deep cuts to 
branded burn-marks, this little blackblood must have undergone a 
great deal of pain to emphasize so many designs. Sallow yellow 
eyes peer out from beneath sunken sockets set at each side of a 
long, curving falcon-like nose which comically protrudes from his 
face.

A scab-ridden, lanky orc with bloodshot eyes looms here.~
   This malnourished and disgusting creature stands at just under 
three feet and has a slightly slouched posture, causing him to 
appear even smaller then his already miniscule height. Although 
mostly bald, his oversized head has several braids of greasy, 
matted brown hairclinging to it, draping down to just above two 
bloodshot eyes, the pupils a reddish pink color. His slightly 
yellowed pale skin bears a similarity to ivory and provides a 
stark contrast to the number of dark scabs and festering wounds 
that cover the majority of his body. His bony arms bear the 
majority of these, the most prominent one being on his left wrist 
and covering two inches of flesh in each direction from the 
center.

A stocky, pale-skinned orc wearing black face paint is here.~
   This brute of an orc stands at roughly four feet, he has broad 
shoulders and his arms are quite muscular and overly long, giving 
him an ape like appearance. The creatures skin is quite pale and 
marred by several ritual scars and markings. Slanted yellow eyes 
scan the area with a predatory intelligence, the eyelids and the 
skin around it painted black by some unknown substance that forms 
a crude depiction of a spider on his face. His gut is covered by 
a layer of fat and has a large, crudely made scar of a spider web 
stretching across it.

she could be easily mistaken for a male by a casual observer. 
Strands of ragged black hair frame her round face, some of them 
falling to partly cover a pair of wide-set, reddish eyes. Thin, 
blackish lips hide a gap where her front teeth used to be, 
probably a remembrance of some old fight or brawl.

a variable worker orc~
A variable worker orc stands here.~
   This small creature looks tired, the hardships of demanding 
work coupled with poor feeding etched deep into its features. It 
moves with a small hunch, eyes darting around nervously in search 
for possible dangers. It smells of sweat, blood, and other 
things that should better remain undescribed.

a short, blunt-nosed orc~
A short, blunt-nosed orc with a tuft of black hair stands here, leering.~
   This diminutive blunt nosed orc seems to leer angrily at 
anything and everything around it. Perhaps, attempting to make 
up for its shortness of stature. Its face is covered by long 
years of scarring and abuse. Its deep red eyes bare a hollow 
stare that contains little sign of life. Short, scraggly tufts 
of mistreated hair extend from this tough, old orcs head. One of 
its tusks juts up from out of his mouth, its other has been 
unceremoniously broken, both are rotten and yellowed. It's the 
toughened look of one who has endured many battles.

a long-fingered orc with long, loping legs~
A long-fingered orc with long, loping legs watches the shop.~
   This orc makes one think of a spider. Far taller than most 
others of his kind, this orc has long, thin arms and long legs 
extending from his body. He usually stays hunched, not so much 
as if it had to, as most orcs do, but more as if he was on guard 
from a blow to the gut at any second or as if he was readying to 
pounce on any attacker. Long, pointed ears poke from the sides 
of his head, and his long hair is wrapped in a dirty pony-tail 
that reaches almost to the orc's hips. He doesn't really appear 
out of shape, despite his gaunt form; quite the contrary as his 
muscles are well defined, and make a clear, sinewy outline 
against green hide.

A white-bearded, one-eyed orc looms here, his head shaven bald.~
   This tall veteran orc has a long white beard to complement his 
shaven head. One of his eyes is missing and where it should be 
is a long vicious white scar upon his light green flesh. The orc 
looks quite old for it's species but it still seems to be in good 
health. His face seems to resemble a humans more closely then 
the average orc but his gold plated tusks make and light green 
skin make a clear distinction. His nose has a light red shine to 
it as if he had a cold.

a large uruk-hai with a war-torn visage~
A large uruk-hai with a war-torn visage is standing here.~
   This uruk-hai is only slightly larger than most of his kin, 
though his tattered visage and confident posture would set him 
apart from most other uruk-hai. His skin is a deep bruise 
mixture of purple and black and stretches tautly over his frame 
of corded muscle. This skin has a slick, greasy appearance and 
is smooth save for where the common scar or nick raises up. A 
thick mane of dirty grey hair falls loosely to his broad 
shoulders and frames his absolutely destroyed visage. A single 
gash cleaves its way down from just beneath the left of his two 
red eyes, reducing his left nostril to a simple hole in his skull 
before cutting across his lips and mouth. Both his top and 
bottom lips hang loosely in the middle due to this gash, exposing 
a number of broken, snaggled fangs and a near constant stream of 
drool dangles about the broken blood-stained left tusk that 
protrudes from this uruk-hai's jaw, its brother on the right side 
is just as blood-stained but remains intact if jagged.

A lanky, black-haired orc gives orders here.~
   This tall, lanky orc has a shaggy mane of black hair that 
looks like it was cut by knifepoint. His beady black eyes are 
ringed and look very tired, though he is fairly young. His skin 
is medium olive-green, with scars nearly everywhere visible. 
Though not excessively muscular, he looks wiry and competent.

   This soldier is clearly of Haradaic descent, though their hair 
and eyes are lighter than many of their kin and bear a wider

a squat, disfigured orc~
A squat orc is here, his face covered with scars.~
   This powerfully built orc's face is horribly disfigured by 
purplish scars and welts, only adding to the fearsome cast of his 
squashed, brutish features and overbitten jaw. His eyes are 
narrow and red, his brows thick and bristly. Dark brown hair 
falls in matted tangles to his brawny shoulders. Some of his 
muscle has begun to degenerate into fat, and his gut has a 
definite paunch to it.

Firgal tailor goblin weedy vile-smelling snaga shopkeep byCeredir~
a weedy, vile-smelling snaga~
A weedy snaga with a vile smell cringes behind the counter.~
   Small strands of hair emerge from this short, middle-aged 
goblin's forehead. He has beady, little eyes and a long, crooked 
nose. It is quite apparent that he hasn't been eating very well, 
judging by his thin, weedy form. He has a foul stench and a very 
craven appearance, his shoulders bent and broken, spending most 
of his time staring at the ground. His ears are long and flat, 
growing a pinkish-red color on the bottom, and have numerous 
small nicks removed from where the pitiful creature was either 
cut or bitten. His fingernails are long and thin. He has dark 
black hair growing in a short-cropped style. Short, stubby legs 
support his form, though not gracefully.

a bloated orc with waggling jowls~
A bloated orc with waggling jowls flings greasy yrcish foodstuffs about on a crusted iron grill.~
   A gut that rivals the size of most smaller orkish breeds hangs 
from this orc's frame. His bloated body is perched behind a 
crusty iron grill, upon which he slings about a variety of 
foodstuffs suitable only for the starving or orkish. Now and 
then he stuffs a scrap into his mouth, an acne-framed hole 
flanked by waggling jowls.

A weathered uruk-hai is here, riddled with scars.~
   This uruk-hai looks to have seen many a battle in his day, his 
blackened skin weathered and riddled with scars of all sizes. 
His white eyes roam warily over his surroundings, and are hardly 
more than slits in his head. His rigid posture and hard demeanor 
only add to the already intimidating looks of this creature, 
corded muscle exposed through the weathered skin when visible.

a mottled, glint-eyed female snaga~
A glint-eyed female snaga with mottled skin is here.~
   Standing at about average height for the smallest of the yrch, 
this female variety of the race has an extremely wiry, almost 
bony frame. Set in her face are a pair of black, glinting eyes 
that take in the world and prospective customers with shrewd 
calculation. Her thin lips are almost always set in a straight 
line. Drawn tightly over her body is a skin of dark, mottled 
brown, interrupted by a gash of scar tissue across the side of 
her neck.

a towering, heavily muscled man with black skin~
A towering, heavily muscled man with black skin looms nearby. ~
   Standing head and shoulders above the height of any normal 
human, this man is possessed of a wide and heavily muscled frame 
which gives him a truly imposing appearance. His head is shaved 
completely bald and set atop a short, wide neck which connects to 
equally bulky shoulders, each movement sending forth a rippling 
of muscle through his form. His eyes are dark and alert, set 
between a broad, flat nose which hovers above full and fleshy 
lips. He bears some scarring and seems to have seen his fair 
share of battle, though this is not partcularly remarkable or 
disfiguring.

   This stoop shouldered orc is well past her prime, her dark 
mottled skin hanging from her wizened frame in overlapping 
wrinkled folds. The sparse tufts of coarse hair sprouting from 
her head and snout are dingy white her stumpy tusks appear 
yellowed and deeply pitted with age. She stands with stooped 
posture, her back bent and shoulders hunched forward.

a scarred, ivory-skinned woman with dark eyes~
A scarred, ivory-skinned woman with dark eyes lingers nearby.~
   This woman stands at no great height but has a commanding 
presence. Her hair is ink black, straight and kept well 
maintained, though short, hanging only just down to her ears. 
Her figure is slender and toned and features are attractive; she 
may well have been beautiful at one time, though the trials of 
battle have left her with many scars across all her visible flesh 
that mar this significantly. Her eyes are dark and fierce and 
her features suggest a haradaic background, though her skin is 
pale and ivory toned, pointing perhaps to a mixed heritage.

a short, wrinkly goblin with long dreadlocks~
A short, wrinkled goblin is here, with long dreadlocks.~
   This goblin is short and looks to have aged rather poorly, 
though whether this is from work or something else is hard to 
say. His dark skin is covered even more with soot and ash, and 
long claws protrude from the tips of his fingers. Long, 
dirt-riddled dreadlocks fall around his face and down his back, 
stopping just near his knees. White eyes gleam out from large 
sockets.

a stench-ridden orc with a scarred nose~
A stench-ridden orc with a scarred nose tends to the hides.~
   A vile, rotting smell seems imbued in the very flesh of this 
short, stuned orcling, a near-visible cloud of pestilence visible 
as his knobbly frame hobbles about to and fro, accompanied with 
much muttering and cursing that seems almost a reflex action. 
This orc's misshapen head bears many cuts and marks upon it, the 
most prominent a finger-deep scar that twists his bulbous nose 
out of order, no dount granting him immunity from his own putrid 
stench.

Kogha incredibly hairy orkish male~
an incredibly hairy orkish male~
An incredibly hairy orc attends to the shop here.~
   This orkish male is incredibly hairy, with nearly all of his 
visible patches of skin covered in a long, shaggy brown hair. He 
has dirty, curly locks and his face is ringed with an unkempt 
beard. He is fairly skinny, though it is hard to decide on an 
exact figure because of all his hair.

A sickly, yellow-skinned male orc tends to the shop.~
   This orc is not particularly tall, and is extremely thin, his 
yellow, leathery skin wrapping tight around the bony frame. He 
has a short, shaggy black hair that looks greasy, and a pair of 
reddish eyes that blink often as he peers around.

a lean, ebon-skinned orkish female~
A lean female orc with ebon skin lingers here, ready to treat the wounds of fellow soldiers.~
   The head of this orc is crowned with a multitude of braids 
tangled together so chaotically that they would be better off 
being called dreadlocks. The hair falls over this female's 
stooped shoulders like a long coif, numerous feathers and bone 
beads tangled among them. Of average height for an yrch, this 
orc has a dark skin typical for tribes and warbands of Mordor.

a plump, raven haired woman~
A plump, raven haired woman with full, ruby-red lips tends the bar.~
   The woman is short and overweight, sporting several chins and 
thick, ruby red lips. Her figure is pear shaped, with most of 
her bulk seeming to rest in her extraordinarily wide hips and 
buttocks. She is always very heavily made up and this adds to, 
rather than detracts from her rather toad-like appearance. With 
widely spaced, unfocused eyes, several chins and heavy jowls this 
woman borders upon the repulsive, while her sheer bulk could be 
seen as somewhat intimidating.

A saucer-eyed, dark-haired young girl hovers nearby.~
   This girl would appear to be in her young teenage years, for 
her figure is extremely thin and without any of the curvature of 
womanhood. She has tanned skin and child-like features, with 
large, olive-green eyes and a pert nose with a spattering of 
freckles. Her mahogany coloured hair grows thick and straight 
and has been cut into a short bob at chin length, though it looks 
glossy and well cared for.

an older, balding fellow with a wooden leg clatters about.~
   This man is past the prime of his life as he balding head and 
many wrinkles will attest to but seems to still have a good 
measure of vitality. He has a slight beer belly and a large, 
knob nose but his most defining feature is that he has lost his 
left leg at sometime in the past and a wooden one has been fitted 
instead. Time and practice mean he is able to move about upon it 
nimbly enough, but causes something of a clattering as he does.

A black-skinned, dreadlocked woman with pale eyes stands nearby.~
   This woman is of average build and height, with an attractive 
figure favoured with shapely curves and smooth chocolate skin. 
Atop her head is a wild mane of thick, black, dreadlocked hair, 
extending past her shoulders into which have been tied and 
braided many feathers as well of beads of clay and bone. She has 
a broad, flat nose and full lips disguising a set of strikingly 
white teeth. Her most unusual feature by far are her eyes where 
the iris seems devoid of nearly all pigmentation, to the point 
that it seems only a very faintly blue ring about her pupils, 
hardly discernible from the white which surrounds it.

A brutally scarred, one-handed man stands nearby.~
   This man seems to have seen an enormous amount of hardship in 
his life for he is covered from head to toe in brutal and vicious 
scars, many of them seeming very old, while others look quite 
recent. His skin, is deeply bronzed, though tough, leathery and 
weathered at the same time. His hair is cropped close to his 
head and peppered with grey though his body remains toned and 
firm. Most strikingly, his left hand is completely missing, a 
stump hanging useless where this ought to be.

a massively-muscled hulk of a man with pitch-black skin~
A massively-muscled hulk of a man with pitch-black skin looms here.~
   This massively-muscled hulk of a man stands head and shoulders 
above the average human, and significantly broader. His entire 
form is encased in battle-scarred, pitch-black skin and his head 
is shaved completely bald. His eyes are dark and sunken deeply 
beneath a heavy brow. His nose is wide and flattened with large, 
flaring nostrils and his lips are thick and conceal a selection 
of broken, yellowed teeth. His limbs are long and thickly 
muscled, ending in cumbersome and ungainly hands and feet.

A smartly groomed young man with milky skin stands to attention here.~
   This man is tall and his form is toned, though he does not 
appear bulky. His hair is of a medium brown and cropped close to 
his head and well cared for and presented while his eyes are 
dark. His features would suggest a haradaic background with a 
strong jaw, thin lipped mouth and broad, slightly flattened nose 
though his skin appears too pale, being almost milky in colour.

A variable snaga slummer is here.~
   Shoulders stooped and head held low, this pitiful example of 
the smallest of orkish breed stalks through the Pits with a 
worried, broken expression. The tiny creature bears many scars 
from being beaten and bullied by bigger or stronger orcs, yet a 
tiny spark of feral aggressivity still lingers somewhere deep in 
the sunken eyes.

Casugei Noyen First Thirteenth Blade stern intricate tattoos BALCHOTH_VanguardLeader~
A stern-eyed man covered in intricate tattoos~
A stern-eyed man covered in intricate tattoos stands here.~
   Taller than many of his people, this swarthy warrior has been 
inked with a series of intricate tattoos which cover him from 
head to foot, every inch of skin covered in sigils, lines, and 
abstract patterns, amongst which, perhaps most notably, a 
stylized eagle, wings outstretched and a sword clutched by the 
blade in its talons, has been worked over his face; from within 
the wings of the patterned bird, dark eyes gaze forth, stern, and 
seeming almost to shine with a hidden fervour. Perhaps slightly 
on the slender side, he nonetheless possesses a solid 
musculature, and he moves with a grace and self-assurance which 
befit his position well. His black hair falls just past his 
shoulders.

Vemator Noyen reclaims heavily tattooed grey flecked BALCHOTH_VanguardOfficer~
A heavily-tattooed man with grey-flecked hair~
A heavily-tattooed man with grey-flecked hair stands here.~
   Short in stature, this aging Balchoth warrior nonetheless cuts 
an impressive figure, his body boasting tattoos and battle-scars 
from his feet up to his face in equal numbers. Whorls, patterns, 
and symbolic sigils have been inked into nearly every available 
patch of dusky, sun-bronzed skin, while formations of solid 
muscle speak of a life-long service to the pursuit of battle. 
His wild, gray-shot hair is tamed into a braid that ends between 
his shoulder blades with chunky bands of polished, engraved 
bronze. His cleanly-shaven face boasts tattoos that cover every 
surface save for his lips and eyelids, these markings 
periodically broken apart by the crags of his wrinkles and ridges 
of milky scar tissue.

Keriyen man priest lean grim-featured filmy-eyed BALCHOTH_CORRUPTED~
a filmy-eyed, grim-featured man~
A grim-featured, tattooed man stands here, eyes filmy.~
   Once much taller than those surrounding him, this lean man is 
free from any sign of fat and possessing just enough muscle to 
avoid being thin, and stands now with a slight stoop, face 
uplifted to sniff at the air. Perhaps once an imposing figure, 
his brown skin bears an unhealthy pallour; patterned lines cover 
his skin, almost making it appear as though the ink were the 
background on which the colour of his skin was set. The tattoos 
bear no obvious imagery, consisting solely of lines, whirls, and 
various bends, intricate, and which might once have lent him a 
menacing air; now, they contrast horrifically with the dark, 
pulsing veins which writhe beneath that pallid skin. His nose is 
still prominent, aquiline, and his face set in a stern mask, his 
a white film formed over his dark eyes; from the sockets, veins 
stretch across the film's surface before disappearing once more, 
clearly rendering him sightless. Nonetheless, he bears a short 
beard and moustache, his appearance and the changes wrought in 
him giving him an appearance of horrible solemnity.

Unguzut strong jawed stocky man veins black-veined BALCHOTH_CORRUPTED~
a stocky, black-veined man~
A stocky, strong-jawed man stands here, black veins visible beneath his skin.~
   Short and somewhat on the broad side, the dark colour of this 
man's eyes is visible even through the film of milky white which 
covers them; the black veins which grow across his eyes before 
disappearing into the socket opposite them are altogether more 
disturbing in appearance, and the pallour which has overtaken his 
brown skin lets similar black, pulsing veins show beneath. 
Though not heavily tattooed, his right shoulder bears the 
upwards-pointing arrow indicative of his caste, while his left 
bears a circle of twelve stars around his solid forearms have 
been patterned a series of entangling vines. A few scars cross 
his face, and, unusually for one of his status, a few tattoos on 
his face bear the appearance of scars; a few fresh injuries also 
mark his skin, still oozing, but showing no signs of healing. 
Clean-shaven, he has a well-defined jawline which ends in a 
slightly protruding chin, and his hair, long, black, and 
straight, falls midway down his back. Even now, his features are 
impassive, his head tilted back as he sniffs sightlessly at the 
air.

A stocky, long-haired woman stands here, black veins visible beneath her skin.~
   Short and somewhat on the broad side, this muscular woman's 
dark eyes, once watchful, now bear the film of the majority of 
her fellows, and are likewise covered over in black veins. 
Though not heavily tattooed, her right shoulder bears the 
upwards-pointing arrow indicative of her caste, while her left 
bears a circle of twelve stars around her solid forearms have 
been patterned a series of entangling vines. A few scars cross 
his face, and, unusually for one of her status, a few tattoos on 
her face bear the appearance of scars. Her features are 
impassive, her skin now pallid and lined with black-veins, though 
she sniffs at the air as she surveys the area, her lips fixed in 
a permanent, thin-lipped smile. She has a well-defined jawline 
which ends in a slightly protruding chin, and her hair, long, 
black, and straight, falls midway down her back.

Bilcai lank scarred youth deathly pallour BALCHOTH_CORRUPTED~
a lanky, scarred youth with a deathly pallour~
A lank, scarred youth with a deathly pallour stands here.~
   This young man looks as though he has yet to reach the full 
strength of manhood, a thin, scruffy beard covering his face in 
an ineffective attempt at making him look older. More slender 
than many, he yet shows the beginnings of corded muscle, and his 
skin, though swarthy, has an almost sallow cast to it, enhanced 
by the deathly pallour he carries; together with the black veins 
which pulse visibly beneath his skin, this gives him an 
altogether unnatural appearance. Nonetheless, he wears his 
armour with practiced ease, one hand clenched tightly about the 
hilt of his weapon as, dark eyes sightless looking about, he 
breathes deeply, scenting his surroundings. Aside from the usual 
warrior tattoo, the arrow of which has been altered slightly to 
resemble a stylized tree, this man's left shoulder bears a 
three-peaked mountain struck through by a jagged bolt of 
lightning.

Sakigh sturdy hawk-browed man sightless BALCHOTH_CORRUPTED~
a sturdy, hawk-browed man~
A sturdy, hawk-browed man stands here, keeping sightless watch.~
   Short and sturdily built, this warrior stands nearly 
motionless, his stance seemingly relaxed even as he turns his 
head so that he might survey the surrounding area with his 
sightless eyes. His eyebrows, arching upwards from where they 
meet just above the bridge of his nose, taper as they go to the 
side, giving him a somewhat hawkish appearance, an impression now 
lessened somewhat by the film which has formed over his dark 
eyes, with root-like veins stretching across his eyes before they 
vanish beneath the eyelids opposite. His left arm bears a tattoo 
of a shield just below the shoulder, and, aside from the tattoo 
of the arrow signifying caste on his right, he bears a smattering 
of others, including a set of tattooed bracers which underlie the 
bronze bracelets fitted about his wrists, all his tattoos being 
lacquered upon his armour as well. His swarthy skin bears a 
pallour, black veins stretching just beneath its surface.

Kimagh man sturdy grim-featured sightless BALCHOTH_CORRUPTED~
a sturdy, grim-featured man with pale eyes~
A sturdy, grim-featured man stands here rigidly, keeping a sightless watch.~
Of a moderate height for one of his people, which is to say short by the standards of most men, this sturdily-built, swarthy warrior stands rigidly at his post, his dark eyes, covered now with an opaque white film, still scanning the area about him sightlessly. Broad shoulders give the man a solid appearance, and indeed he shows no lack of muscle, taut and wiry though it is. His left arm bears a tattoo of a shield just below the shoulder, and, aside from the tattoo of the arrow signifying caste on his right, he bears a noticeable number of other markings, perhaps most notably the crossed axes on one forearm or the horns and antlers of various four-legged beasts which are distributed across his other limbs.  His skin now has an odd sheen to it, black veins visible just beneath its surface.

Gebkui battle scarred stiff warrior man BALCHOTH_SparringNPC~
a battle-scarred, stiff-legged warrior~
A battle-scarred, stiff-legged warrior stands here, weapon in hand.~
   Compact and muscular, this man stands in a way which favours 
his right leg, a distinct stiffness to it visible when he moves. 
His face is marked with numerous battle-scars, a slightly 
off-centre nose testament to several breaks, and a heavy stubble 
covers his lower face. When visible, his right arm bears the 
sign of the warrior caste, while on his left, a hawk with talons 
outstretched as it dives is visible. Over his forearms, what 
appears to represent a leather belt wraps around several times, 
numerous weapons tattooed over it representing the implements 
which which he has become skilled. His hair is cut short, 
fitting entirely under his helmet, and he stands ever vigilant 
for those who would ready themselves to face the West.

orc Sirka sinewy black mohawk Slums_Gateguard byCeredir~
a sinewy orc with a black mohawk~
A sinewy orc with a black mohawk watches over the gate, a bow close at hand.~
   Rope-like muscles stretch under the near-black skin of this 
orkish male, his shoulders stooped slightly in a perpetual hunch. 
A large head is crowned by a thick mohawk of hair which stand 
stiffly like bristles, cut unevenly at about an inch of length. 
Pointed ears stick to the sides of his head, giving him a rather 
comical appearance, but the assortement of scars and menacing 
posture hint that laughter is not recommended.

a variable orkish soldier snaga~
A variable snaga soldier is here.~
   Small and weedy, this tiny snaga bears his weapons with little 
skill and even less discipline, but seems to make up for it with 
the savage attitude. The creature seems ready to fight for its 
master until it dies... unless it manages to flee and hide 
first.

a pallid, willowy female orc~
A pallid, willowy female orc stands by the gates.~
   Pale-skinned and squat, this orc resembles a weeping willow 
with her stooped posture, long limbs, and the unruly mop of 
wire-like long white hair that falls into her face. Reddish eyes 
glare from behind of this curtain, slanted and full of hatred. A 
sharply curved nose pokes out of the gaunt face, granting her an 
avian appearance.

A monstrous orkish creature with a pebbly skin stands by the gate.~
   Towering and massive, this olog-hai towers even above most of 
his own race. Muscles bulge around his figure, wrapped in gray 
skin of a pebbly texture, resembling a large rock more than 
anything else. He emits soft grumbling sounds with each of his 
breaths, beady, reddish eyes watching the passers by with a bored 
expression.

A skeletally thin, wrinkled old woman stands here with a stern expression.~
   This ancient woman has bronzed skin stretched tight over rangy 
bones. She has a large, beak like nose upon a face of wrinkles 
that combined with her beady, dark eyes give this venerable woman 
a somewhat vulture like appearance. Her hair is stark white and 
pulled back into a tight bun behind her head. She has a slightly 
hunched back and moves with slow, arthritic movements though her 
eyes betray a keen intelligence beneath the wizened exterior.

Black hair spills from beneath a helm of bronze, and, inscribed

stylized marks, or otherwise, and they are marked by the 
occasional scar, which, together with the focused look in their 
eyes and the grim set to their lips, marks out a lifetime of 
experience in war.

shoulder. However many years they have seen, this warrior's arms 
and legs bear a number of tattoos, be they of animals, weaponry, 
stylized marks, or otherwise, and they are marked by the 
occasional scar, which, together with the focused look in their 
eyes and the grim set to their lips, marks out a lifetime of 
experience in war.

Cyrus rawboned man hawkish demeanor BALCHOTH_ELDER_JACKAL~
a rawboned man of hawkish demeanor~
A rawboned man of hawkish demeanor is here.~
   This scrawny figure appears to be a man if only because his 
sharply formed countenance lends towards the masculine, as his 
figure seems little more then an almost androgynous skeleton and 
wiry cables of taut muscles swathed in sun-bronzed skin decorated 
liberally with green-tinted, harshly angled tattoos that dominate 
his narrow chest down to the tips of his spidery fingers. His 
gangly arms and legs are disproportional to his relatively short 
torso for an awkward appearance border-lining on the absurd. His 
hair would appear to be a solid shade of jet black if one where 
to examine what little stubble there is to be seen across his 
closely shaven skull and cheeks, his eyebrows being the only 
discernible hair apparent on his head.

an ebony-backed, bronze-furred jackal~
A bronze-hued jackal with an ebony-shaded back is here.~
   This slender, long-eared jackal is a shock of rusty bronze 
fur, bearing a long stripe of solid black fur that goes from the 
base of her neck down to the tip of her lengthy fluffy tail. Her 
features are narrow and vaguely lupine in nature, and while her 
fangs are exceedingly sharp they only lend to hunting small 
animals. Her eyes are a solid red hue reminiscent of blood and 
bare a perpetually inquisitive gleam to them.

A hulking arachnid monster looms here, ugly and dangerous.~
   A huge spider hulks here, its huge body standing taller than 
the biggest of warhorses. Massive legs support the bulging 
shape, bearing claw-like extensions, ready to rip apart anything 
coming too close. Ragged stretches of spiderweb wrap around the 
abdomen, covering a number of cocoons that are attached directly 
to this mother spider's carapace.

A sinewy, ashen-skinned female orc is here.~
   Fairly slim for an orc and possessing a well-muscled body, 
this orkish female stands fairly tall for one of her kind and 
bears herself with in a self conscious manner. An unruly crop of 
bristly black hair crowns her head, a few gray str eaks running 
through it here and there. Thin, black lips conceal rows of 
sharp, yellowed teeth, a hooked nose above the m giving her an 
avian appearance.

A tall, fair-haired woman with shimmering green eyes stands here.~
   This woman is tall, with silvery blonde hair which flows down 
well past her waist in silken waves. Her skin is pale and 
smooth, almost to the point of translucency and bears the rosy 
glow of youth. Her large eyes are a shimmering, deep green in 
colour and set either side of a pert nose. She has a strong bone 
structure and high cheekbones while her lips are full, coral-pink 
and bow shaped. She is tall and long limbed, with delicate, 
long-fingered hands and feet and blossoming curves that suggest 
she is only just emerging into womanhood.

a tall, maggot-infested abomination~
A tall, maggot-infested abomination looms before you.~
   This monstrosity is tall, and may have at some point in it's 
tortured past have been female. A few strands of long, silvery 
blonde hair sill cling to the scalp of this decomposing fiend 
while what remains of her skin is papery and stretched tight 
across yellowed bones, which it peels away from in several 
places. Where once may have been eyes rest now two baleful, 
empty sockets, blackness staring hatefully out at the world 
before it. Her teeth are jagged and sharpened, while hands have 
sprouted terrible claws. She is in the late stages of decay and 
maggots and other creatures of the grave may be discerned about 
her form. Though difficult to be certain, the gashes across her 
abdomen, which allow bloated and reeking guts to poke through, 
were probably responsible for the death of this figure in ages 
past.

A lasciviously made-up, olive-skinned woman is here.~
   This woman stands at about average height and though not 
particularly large, can be said to be carrying slightly more 
weight than is truly attractive about her belly, giving her a 
slight muffin top. She is past the prime of her years, though 
she often attempts to cover this with a very large amount of 
makeup, which is slathered upon her face at all times. Large, 
ruby red lips compete amidst a melee of other gaudy colours upon 
her face for supremacy, while her hair is pulled away from her 
face into a tight bun behind her head, where it is often held in 
place with a variety of ostentatious adornments. This throws the 
fine lines upon her face into a harsh light, while her prominent 
nose is made to appear all the more so, appearing positively 
beak-like.

A very hairy, strong-armed man of stocky build tends to the horses here.~
   This man stands not especially tall, but extraordinarily broad 
and thickly muscled. Every inch of his visible body is covered 
with thick, curling black hair which forms a rugged coat for his 
sun-bronzed skin. He has a thick, bushy beard which descends 
down until it meets the thick carpet of hair upon his chest. His 
features are strong and rugged, though a hard life is evident 
upon them and his nose appears to have been broken at least once.

A riding horse prototype stands here calmly, whickering.~
   Of average bulk and graceful tone, this creature's coat and
mane are well-groomed and cut, hinting that it leads a life of
domestication rather than one in the wilderness. Standing tall
on four muscular legs, there is no hesitancy or fear detectable
in this horse's posture, seemingly ready to spring into a flurry
of action and motion at a moment's notice.

A wheat-haired, cornflower-blue-eyed young woman is here.~
   Thick waves of wheat colored hair tumble around this woman's 
shoulders, stopping around the middle of her back. Her brow is 
high and clear, a set of cornflower blue eyes peering out from 
beneath it, framed by thin, pale eyebrows and nearly 
imperceptable lashes, even paler than her eyebrows. Her skin is 
fair and creamy colored, though weathered slightly from the 
elements. Her arms are strong and end with capable hands marred 
by tiny scars all over her fingertips. Lithe, but sturdy, she is 
well-proportioned except for her hips which are a wide and flare 
down into thick thighs.

   This woman is short and rather stocky in her build, having 
voluptuous curves across much of her body. She is not especially 
well favoured, with thick, frizzy hair constantly poking in every 
direction, dark mahogany in colour. Her face is chubby and she 
has a large beak like nose with full and pouting lips. Upon her 
upper lip is a large, dark brown mole, from which several hairs 
sprout, while her eyes are squinting and deeply set behind a 
prominent brow.

Akhral shaven-headed sinewy man GAOLER REFLECTED_MOON_CLAN~
a shaven-headed, sinewy man~
A shaven-headed, sinewy man stands here, keeping an eye on the door.~
   Dark skin wraps around this tall man's sinewy form, its brown 
hue resembling mahogany wood. His chin and head are hairless, 
shaven to perfect smoothness. Twin eyes of a chestnut color 
frame a flat, wide nose which seems to have been broken in past. 
A number of scars mar this man's gaunt face, hinting at a combat 
experience. The martial feeling is only accented by the 
stiff-backed, rigid posture and curt, swift movements.

Grimma ostler orc claw-marked pallid shopkeeper~
a pallid, claw-marked orc~
A pallid orc scurries through the pens, his face scarred with claw-marks.~
   Small and long-limbed, this orkish male moves around with a 
comical swagger, his bent legs twisted so much out of shape that 
they seem to make moving around a complicated task for their 
owner. The pallid, sickly skin is frequently marked by numerous 
deep, ridged scars, possibly results of claws or teeth tearing 
the tissue away. A receding chin bears a wispy beard, sparse, 
long and tangled. Both ears are ragged, little of their original 
shape still visible.

Molock Breatheater corpulent crimson-eyed uruk-hai Pits_Boss~
a corpulent, crimson-eyed uruk-hai~
A corpulent uruk-hai with crimson eyes is here.~
   Large and muscular, this uruk-hai sports a sizeable belly that 
has a tendency to droop over his belt in an unsightly manner. 
His skin is dark to the point of being near-black, and is 
completely hairless. Even his head is bare and smooth, a 
perpetual sheen of sweat clinging to it. Twin reddish eyes peer 
out of a round face, thick lips concealing a number of sharp 
fangs and his nose has been smashed in repeatedly so much that it 
now seems almost flat.

a squat orkish overseer~
A squat orkish overseer keeps an eye on his surroundings.~
   Short and barrel-chested, this orc looks quite better fed than 
the pitiful orkish workers he usually oversees. He bears himself 
with a good deal of self-assurance, a vicious, cruel glint often 
in his eyes.

A dark-brown-furred, short-muzzled warg prowls through the area.~
   This warg appears, without doubt, to have seen much better 
times. Its fur is mangy and patched in places, from vermin and 
filth. Yellowed but sharp teeth glisten with fetid saliva, and 
its eyes, where not glazed over by a thick coat of rheum, gaze 
out at the world with a disconcertingly potent anger and hatred. 
Yet, it looks tired, and worn, suitable only for riding, not 
combat.

warg mangy prototype POOR_QUALITY_MORGUL_MOUNT~
a dark-eyed, sleek warg~
A dark-eyed, sleek warg is here, growling at passersby.~
   This warg appears, without doubt, to have seen much better 
times. Its fur is mangy and patched in places, from vermin and 
filth. Yellowed but sharp teeth glisten with fetid saliva, and 
its eyes, where not glazed over by a thick coat of rheum, gaze 
out at the world with a disconcertingly potent anger and hatred. 
Yet, it looks tired, and worn, suitable only for riding, not 
combat.

   A set of long yellowed fangs dominates the angular face of 
this sizeable warg. Well over half the height of a man at its

A mangy young warg prowls through the area.~
   Absolutely massive for one of its kind, this powerfully-built 
warg moves with unnerving grace and precision. Possessed of 
jagged, lethally sharp fangs, and a thick, healthy mane of fur, 
there is little doubt that this animal is currently in its prime. 
Its muscle is well-toned and amply distributed, and it appears to 
be, in all, quite a menacing figure.

warg vicious-looking GOOD_QUALITY_MORGUL_MOUNT~
a scarred warg~
A scarred warg is here, snarling loudly.~
   Absolutely massive for one of its kind, this powerfully-built 
warg moves with unnerving grace and precision. Possessed of 
jagged, lethally sharp fangs, and a thick, healthy mane of fur, 
there is little doubt that this animal is currently in its prime. 
Its muscle is well-toned and amply distributed, and it appears to 
be, in all, quite a menacing figure.

warg vicious-looking GOOD_QUALITY_MORGUL_MOUNT~
an ebony-furred, one-eared warg~
An ebony-furred, one-eared warg prowls about menacingly.~
   Absolutely massive for one of its kind, this powerfully-built 
warg moves with unnerving grace and precision. Possessed of 
jagged, lethally sharp fangs, and a thick, healthy mane of fur, 
there is little doubt that this animal is currently in its prime. 
Its muscle is well-toned and amply distributed, and it appears to 
be, in all, quite a menacing figure.

Slaar goat headed wired muscular humanoid hooved DRAGON_GUARD bySOLON~
a hooved, muscular humanoid with a wired head of a goat~
A hooved, muscular humanoid with a wired head of a goat tromps about here.~
   Here is a squat, muscled humanoid with the head of a goat 
wired onto its massive neck. The head, along with the complete
left side of the body is covered in a matted, black fur, while
the right has a thick, leathery-like greenish skin. A pair of 
overly large, red eyes are set above its wide snout that is
continually dripping with a yellowish snot. The two strange 
lower limbs of the creature has hooves instead of feet, wired
together in much the same way as its head. Its arms are 
comparable to small tree trunks in width, with exceedingly long,
blood-crusted fingers. 

   It is wearing the very basics of protective armors with the
chest, legs, and arms outfitted with a hardened leather material
that is sewn into the skin itself with thick, coarse thread.

Gurrna dark winged raven headed creature DRAGON_GUARD bySOLON~
a dark-winged, raven-headed humanoid with three eyes~
A dark-winged, raven-headed humanoid with three eyes is here, stalking the area.~
   This humanoid has a body similar to an orc with a few 
exceptions, a pair of large, black wings, a strange head, and
three eyes. The wings arch up over the shoulder blades with the 
tips of them coming down nearly to its ankles. The head bears a
close resemblance to that of a raven which is attached to a wide 
neck, having been sewn and attached in some pecular way. The 
adjoining section of flesh between the head and necks looks as if 
the head had been ripped off the body, and this bird-like one set 
down upon it, fused together in some unnatural way, tiny strands
of wire criss-crossing at the base. Long, black feathers adorn
the pecular wings that twitch and move every so often. The face 
of the creature is covered with feathers also, and has a long, 
sharp-looking beak. Three eyes are set within the head, one
centered above the other pair, and they all are capable of 
looking in different directions at once.

   It wears only a set of blood-soaked leather leggings along
with an armband and necklace made of several teeth around the
neck.

Laosk four legged scorpion tailed scale humanoid DRAGON_GUARD bySOLON~
a four-legged, scorpion-tailed scale-covered humanoid~
A four-legged, scorpion-tailed, scale-covered humanoid crawls about, smelling of sulfur.~
   Standing at about waist high to a normal ork this creature 
crawls about on four legs, similar to the movement of a lizard. 
It has scales that cover the entire length which are of various 
sizes and shapes. On the backside there is a long, tail with a 
stinger which drips of a foul substance causing a sizzling sound 
upon anything it happens to fall upon. The head of the being is 
grossly misshapened into a triangular form along with a thorny 
barb that extends from it, having been forged into the skull and 
secured with wire. Two oblong, purplish eyes are set vertically, 
one directly above the other. It has no ears, but there are two 
noticeable holes in the side of the head, where such might of 
been, blood slowly oozing out of these orifices.

   Only a small bone collar adorns the creature, protecting the
neck as the scales across it's body acts like armor for the rest
of the body.

Drozgh drooling eyeless headed talon clawed DRAGON_GUARD bySOLON~
a drooling and eyeless, two-headed, talon-clawed humanoid~
A drooling and eyeless, two-headed, talon-clawed humanoid shuffles about here.~
   This tall, broad-shouldered humanoid has two heads, one of
which is set upon the right shoulders, noticeably smaller then 
its larger counterpart to its side. Most of the flesh upon both
heads has been skewered off due to the various wires that wrap
tightly around both. The larger head is missing a portion of its
skull, as if it has been cleaved, angling from top of the left 
ear over and up to the middle of the cranium. Both of the heads
have eyeless sockets. Thick spittle runs down the chins of both, 
and it remarkably seems to have no problem in any movement or 
task that would normally require the use of eyes. It has a 
hide-like, brownish colored flesh with far-reaching sharp talons 
that replace the first digit of each knobby finger.

   The creature is wearing a strange suit of iron of iron mail
that is hewn into the flesh, covered in blood and gore.

a tall, overweight, black-bearded man~
A tall, overweight, black-bearded man stands here, eyes gleaming.~
   This relatively tall man sports a large belly which over hangs 
his midsection, resting like an avalanche of flesh upon his 
thights. His beard is thick with wiry bristles shooting straight 
out from his face offering his broad face almost unreal 
proportions. His skin is swarthy and gleams in the light. His 
eyes are squinty, black and shining under folds of fat and 
bracketed by crows feet on either side. They gleam with an 
almost feral intensity, looking for weakness, sinister in their 
intent.

a snaggle-toothed, crimson-eyed, hunched goblin~
A snaggle-toothed, crimson-eyed, hunched goblin stands here.~
   This old, rough-skinned goblin has a perpetual sneer upon his 
lips due to a scar along his upper lip that leads nearly to his 
right ear. He has a pair of deep-set, crimson eyes placed within 
a saggy, fleshy face. A single chipped and yellow tooth pokes 
out from his thick, lumpy lips. Long, curled fingers extend from 
callused and scarred hands. A few thin strands of grimy, grey 
hair sticks up small tufts along his head. Although being 
hunched-backed, this does not hinder the nimbleness of his 
movements.

A tall, obsidian-eyed, well-muscled man is here.~
   This man has a strong presence, his dark eyes almost devoid of 
the whites or speckles expected of others. His pale skin can 
only highlight the thick black hair that runs over his shoulders. 
Clearly a man of some physical strength, he carries himself with 
a military confidence in his stride and posture. His face is 
heart-shaped, narrow at the jaw line and wider at the cheekbones, 
with thick lips and a strong straight nose. He gives out a 
steady strength and confidence rare to see so clearly in most 
men.

   This man is sturdily built, with wide shoulders and a broad, 
muscular chest. His arms, legs and waist all echo the same built 
as his upper body, thick and strong. Skin coloured as brown as 
the earth covers this man's entire body from head to toe, and a 
shock of wild raven-black hair atop of his head shows that this 
colour is not just the result of solely outdoor living. His 
heavily calloused hands are nimble despite their large size, and 
this man flowing movements seems odd with his thickset body. 
This man bears himself in a proud manner, shoulders squared and 
head held high.

Grorha uruk-hai stout wispy-haired female trainerNPC~
a stout, wispy-haired uruk-hai female~
A stout, wispy-haired uruk-hai female stands here, ready to train the orkish soldiers.~
   This orkish female doesn't seem exeptionally tall for one of 
her breed, but she makes up for it with the breadth of her 
shoulders and her meaty, well-muscled figure. A crooked, long 
nose sticks out of a flat face, a pair of slanted, yellowish eyes 
set to either side above a thin-lipped but wide mouth. A number 
of scars adorn the creature's dark-hued skin, although some of 
them don't seem to be a result of warfare, their symbolic, 
ordered nature making them appear like a gruel, ritual marking of 
some sort.

an ebony-skinned man with brown eyes~
An ebony-skinned man with brown eyes stands ready to train Haradrim.~
Short, pitch black hair with only trace hints of grey beginning
to pepper his hair. Thick, bushy black eyebrows framing his
dark brown eyes, themselves nearly black. His nose is large and
his nostrils seem to be constantly flared out. His face is that
of an experienced soldier, bearing few scars and the leathery
texture of someone who's spent far too long in the searing hot
sun of the far Harad reaches. Thick, ropey muscles cover his
arms and shoulders, his arms ending in rough, calloused fingers
with ragged, chipped fingernails. His legs are lean, not heavily
muscled though, suggesting that this man is an excellent runner.

a rangy, dark-haired man~
A rangy, dark-haired man is here.~
   Fairly tall for a Haradan, this man is covered in olive-hued 
skin. He is muscular, but this is predominantly focused on broad 
shoulders, which, when combined with his long-legged height still 
gives him a rangy appearance. His corded arms end in broad, 
heavily calloused hands with scarred knuckles. Set slightly too 
narrow in his square face are chestnut eyes overlooking a rounded 
nose and thin-lipped mouth. His face is clean-shaven and topped 
with short, tousled blue-black hair.

A colossal olog-hai with pitch-black scales looms here.~
   Extremely thick scales coloured as black as pitch dwell all 
over this enormous creature's body with the exception of a random 
scattering of silvery contrast. Poisonously green eyes look out 
in naturally cruel, narrowed glare through deep-set sockets, no 
sign of hair in any location notable from most distances. His 
limbs are as long and wide as the thickest tree trunks, bulky but 
natural muscle highlighting in most areas save for a rather 
gigantic, rounded belly. He towers over all Olog-hai, and is 
considered one of the largest of his troll kin, if one was lucky 
enough to find more to make the comparison.

A squat, barrel-chested orc stands here.~
   This mordorian orc is perhaps one of the more bulky of his 
kind, however not the tallest. His wide, shaved-bald head sits 
atop a short, almost as equally wide neck, baring black eyes 
which glare out at those around him, scarred lips also curling 
naturally into a snarl. His ribcage is exceptionally large with 
a rounded torso, giving him the appearance of being 
barrel-chested.

Mungdob uruk-hai slate colored adorned tattoos gladiator byCeredir~
a slate colored uruk-hai adorned with tattoos~
A slate colored uruk-hai is here, his skin adorned with tattoos.~
   This wretched being's dark skin covers a frame of impressive 
brawn. His impressive physique could be the result of 
backbreaking labor, superior genetics, or a combination of both. 
His head is covered by stringy dark brown hair that is missing in 
large patches. His yellow eyes stand out above all, set against 
his dark complexion. Deep scar tissue surrounds his eyes with 
other jagged scars on his cheeks and neck. His teeth are chipped 
and incredibly short. His tattoos are not a thing of beauty. 
They are crude and hard to see except up close. If one were to 
examine them, they would find various names written in orkish, 
perhaps a clue into his past.

A green-eyed, black-haired man is standing here.~
   Possessing a slender, tanned body, this long black haired man 
looks about with narrow green eyes. His eyes are positioned 
between a short nose above naturally pursed lips and a dimpled 
chin. His head rests on a long neck, extending from broad 
shoulders with lean but sturdy arms which contain calloused rough 
hands. Supporting his shoulders is a small, but muscular chest, 
and abdomen. His hips are wide and thick with muscle, leading 
down towards two long legs and two calloused feet.

seven inch red tail. Its fur is purely white, if not dirtied. 
The rat has a long narrow snout with two long front teeth at the 
end. It has small feet with sharp little claws. The ears are 
short, with the left one bearing a small bite mark.

a wickedly-scarred, short male goblin~
A wickedly-scarred, short male goblin stands here, watching the doorway.~
   Scars carve their way across the face of this small and weedy 
goblin. Though he looks extremely tough, appearances can often 
be deceiving. His eyes dart about with a maniacal gaze to them. 
His tongue slides out of his jagged-toothed mouth, running over 
his lips time and time again. He seems to take his duty very 
seriously, rarely leaving his post, but he has a frantic look 
that begs for combat.

abomination Kruzga twisted scrawny humanoid creature byCeredir AbomTowerDoorguard~
a twisted, scrawny humanoid~
A twisted, scrawny humanoid stands crouches here.~
   This creature is most likely a goblin, guessing from its size 
and general shape, but it seems so twisted and corrupted that it 
is barely recognizable. Tumorous growths cover one half of its 
head, giving it a grotesque, oversized shape. It stands 
crookedly, a large hump twisting its back and causing it to lean 
to one side. As a result, its left shoulder stands much higher 
than the other one. Its legs are twisted just as well, and seem 
to have more joints than they are supposed to possess.

warg skeletal scars riddled byCeredir UNIQUE abomination~
a skeletal, scar-riddled warg~
A skeletal warg stands here, its fur riddled with scars.~
   Gaunt to the point of where its bones seemingly threaten to 
pierce its fur, this warg's entire body is covered with a 
criss-crossing of ridged scars which leaves only uneven clusters 
of mangy fur hanging from its sides. Its gaze seems empty, 
unseeing, a misty gray veil covering its eyes and concealing the 
original color. Sharp fangs stick out of a large maw, fixed into 
a perpetual snarl due to a large chunk of the upper lip missing. 
A deathly stench of decay rises from this large beast.

A grumpy, one-armed old orc.~
His body is rather lean and covered with a thick,
dried out rosemary colored hide. His eyes are drawn close
against his nose, which has been half torn off. His lips
are dry and cracked, while his jaw sticks out with a rather
obvious underbite, the tips of mangled, sharpened teeth
peeking over his lower lip.

Glurglesletch monstrously huge  aberration bestial troll ABOMINATION~
a monstrously-huge bestial troll~
A monstrously huge aberration of warg and troll is here, snarling and drooling.~
   This trollish aberration is only barely recognizable as such. 
Mainly due to it's brutishly-constructed frame and the off-grey 
coloration of it's flesh not buried beneath shaggy patches of 
greasy, flea-infested fur. Massive slabs of hardened muscle roll 
and stretch beneath it's calloused and battle-scarred hide with a 
grace belying it's shambling gait and slouched posture. Of it's 
size one can readily note that his unholy mixture of warg and 
troll flesh stands even taller than most of it's trollish kind 
despite the fact it's wagon-length shoulders and great spite sit 
forward on it's figure for a perpetually bad posture. A blunted 
muzzle juts forward from it's face and barely hides a mouthful of 
jagged, razor-sharp teeth while beady eyes the colour of rotting 
meat stare out of it's deeply sunken sockets with a crazed, feral 
mania. The creature's nose is little more than two narrow slits 
carved into the grey leather of it's snout. It's head lacks any 
discernable cheek bones or brow, instead what you would find is 
smoothly furred flesh and a sloping forehead that falls back at a 
sharply staggered angle, suggesting an idiotic level of 
intellect. Each fat, stubby finger at the end of it's 
torso-sized fists terminates into a claw roughly the same length 
as a scimitar, curving inward towards it's palms and mattered 
with splatters of rotting gore.

Drawde greasy black haired wraith like man long knife fingers ABOMINATION~
a greasy black-haired, wraith-like man with long, knife-like fingers~
A greasy black-haired, wraith-like man with long, knife-like fingers stands here.~
   This humanoid stands tall and is of a scant build, almost 
wraith-like in his appearance. He is afflicted with a slight bow 
from the neck, looking always slightly towards the ground. A mop 
of black hair, slick with grease, contrasts with the ghostly 
paleness of his skin. His face, long and thin is marred with 
several, now healed, brownish scars, one notably in particular on 
his pronounced cheekbones. The dark eyes, big and quite 
beautiful despite the rest of his visage, peering out from his 
skull, possess an almost sad-like quality. He is clad in shiny, 
tight to the skin leather, looking almost as if it is a one-piece 
suit. A pair of heavy buckled black boots cover his feet and a 
good way up his calf, stopping just beneath his knees. Upon 
closer inspection, his fingers are actually knives of a sort, 
long, slender and razor sharp, wired onto the stumps of his 
fingers.

Grot Grots minuscule sniveling orcish creature ABOMINATION~
a minuscule, sniveling orcish creature~
A minuscule, sniveling orcish creature cowers here.~
   No higher then the knee of a regular human. This creature 
would make a dwarf seem tall in comparison. It's stature is 
almost as pathetic as it's demeanor. Seeming more inclined to 
cowering and hiding then fighting or anything more productive 
then trying to scavenge something to eat like a whipped dog. 
Though it's fingers end in small pointy claws and it's teeth 
boast a needle point it's scrawny, malnourished muscles lack the 
strength to make this hideous and vaguely orcish creature 
anything more then an annoyance unless found in a multitude.

of a swarthy skin, though now this is overtaken by a pallour, 
dark, throbbing veins visible through the skin, and sightless 
eyes covered by a dull white film, across which stretch more

bronze, and, inscribed upon the right upper arm, when not covered

beneath the shoulder. However many years they have seen, this 
warrior's arms and legs bear a number of tattoos, be they of 
animals, weaponry, stylized marks, or otherwise, and they are 
marked by the occasional scar, which, together with the focused 
look in their eyes and the grim set to their lips, marks out a 
lifetime of experience in war, yet now they stand with faces 
lifted, sniffing at the air as they stand, still armed, their 
visage a creation of horror.

Chug squat jagged blade headed stocky humanoid ABOMINATION~
a squat, jagged blade-headed, stocky humanoid~
A squat, jagged blade-headed, stocky humanoid is here.~
   A narrow, funnel-shaped helmet has been attached to this 
humanoids head, wired to its skin with thick chains. A pair of 
red, beady, orc like eyes peer out from the cross visor. Atop 
the helmet, a vicious, jagged blade has been attacked running 
from the back to the front. It stands close to the ground, bulky 
muscle forming the majority of its frame, packed in powerfully to 
its squat body. Thick arms hang down from its body, almost to 
its knees. In place of its left hand, a large slab of metal has 
been fused with thick wire, the skin meshing with the metal. Its 
right holds a thick-bladed shortsword with the hilt removed, the 
shaft of the blade impaled into the bloody stump of its arm. 
Powerful legs suggest its ability to charge headlong into an 
enemy, slashing and smashing anything in its path.

pathetic sobbing young man ABOMINATION~
a pathetic young man who can't quit sobbing~
A pathetic looking young man is here, sobbing uncontrollably.~
   A sad display of humanity is here. Malnourished and filthy, 
this young man poses no considerable danger in his present state. 
It looks as if he has gone a considerable amount of time without 
a solid meal and could waste away at any moment. His hair is 
long and matted with filth ranging from dirt to dung. The only 
clean spot to be found on his face is the streaks leading from 
his eyes created by his many tears. Someone kill this poor 
bastard already.

lumpy angry looking fanged potato ABOMINATION~
a small, angry looking potato bearing fangs~
A lumpy little potato with vicious fangs terrorizes the area.~
   Epitomizing the horror that can be achieved by belligerent 
tubers everywhere, this particular specimen is rather large for 
one of his race -- roughly a fist and a half in size. Several 
eyes stare out at the world, each supplying a glare of 
unsurpassed balefulness. A yawning mouth gapes wide to display 
twin rows of razor teeth that flash bloody in the ambient light, 
gnashing almost perpetually in anticipation. The little spud 
constantly sways and bounces on two bandy, slightly bowed legs, 
and the miniaturized pitchfork it carries often stabs the air in 
excited ire. Contrary to the potato's barbaric and aggressive 
appearance, the jacket it wears is actually quite fetching, and 
appears to have been custom tailored to suit its bulbous form.

Wolfman short skeletal iron clawed man ABOMINATION~
a short, skeletal, iron clawed man~
A short, skeletal, iron clawed man crouches on all fours here.~
   This human is a bundle of bones wrapped in taunt skin, where 
that skin is human it is extremely pale and papery. Around his 
body is wrapped a whole, rotting wolf pelt, complete with head. 
The head has been sewn to the back of the man's neck and the rest 
of the pelt is attached down the side, leaving some fur and the 
animal's legs and tail hanging down. Livid patches of red and 
yellow swell around the stitch marks. The man's jaw seems 
elongated and his teeth have been filed to sharp points. To each 
toe and finger an iron ring with a double pointed metal claw has 
been fixed. One end digs into his foot or hand while the other 
curves out dangerously. The man snarls, snaps and paces like a 
wolf.

Catapas claws green skinny humanoid ABOMINATION~
a skinny, green humanoid with claws~
A skinny, green humanoid with sharp claws stumbles about here.~
   Here is a tall, skinny humanoid with no nose and a mouth that 
has been sewn shut. Its skin has been carved out in rungs and 
dyed green with alternating rungs of brown so that it looks like 
a giant caterpillar. The only thing differentiating it from a 
caterpillar is that it has two arms and two legs. At the end of 
its skinny arms are clawed hands with wickedly sharp fingernails. 
At the end of its two legs are two twisted clubbed feet. It is 
wearing the very basics of protective armors with the chest, 
legs, and arms outfitted with a hardened leather material that is 
sewn into the skin itself with thick, coarse thread.

A young, muscular buck stands here with a wary composure.~
   This young, male deer looks to have recently come to full 
adulthood, bearing his lithe yet muscular body proudly as they 
move about with a certain grace on four thin legs. A pair of 
antlers have sprouted out from between the ears of this young 
buck, branching out over the animal's dark eyes set in its 
elongated face.

a heavily tattooed, wild-haired female orc~
 A heavily tattooed, wild-haired female orc is here.~
   Swirling raven black tattoos of an intricate tribal design 
dominate the face, shoulders, and arms of this grey-brown skinned 
female orc. Hair of an equally dark hue pulls back from her 
scalp tight against the skin in braids, spewing out the back of 
her head in a wild collection augmented by dyed pieces of string, 
bone beads, and raven feathers. Tall for her kind, and long of 
limb, her beady red eyes stare out at the world above her squat 
nose, nostrils blending with the dark tattoos to give the 
appearance of a gaping hole. When visible, short lines of 
scarring show on the undersides of her marked arms, a large 
spider-like shape burned in a scar deep into her left palm.

a striking, lily-skinned woman with pitch-hued locks~
A striking, lily-skinned woman with pitch-hued locks stands here.~
   This woman is the picture of striking elegance, standing quite 
tall and lissome with a straight posture. Her pallid, somewhat 
pointed features bear traces of youth, with a pair of deep grey 
eyes set around an upturned nose, and high, defined cheekbones 
setting off somewhat thin, well-formed lips. Her pitch-dark 
tresses frame both face and form, hanging to her lower back when 
allowed loose. She carries herself with an almost regal air, 
every motion bearing innate grace to the point of a nearly 
stilted manner.

warg WAR-VARIABLE ferocious slathering~
a slathering ferocious war warg~
A slathering ferocious war warg stalks here.~
   This dangerous-looking warg is all muscle and lethal predatory 
grace. Its massive size only lends to the air of menace for its 
lethally sharp fangs are of a scale with the rest of it, making 
them appear even larger than any normal wolf. A thick coat of 
fur acts as its armor and there's little doubt that this creature 
is in peak condition. With each padded step, it slinks forward 
with muscles rippling tautly, ever prepared for the attack.
