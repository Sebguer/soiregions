Vecheso Charan Smokie smug-faced towheaded light-blond-haired man~
a smug-faced, towheaded man~
A light-blond-haired man with a smug face studies his surroundings here.~
   The lightest of blondes dominates this mans hair as it comes 
almost down to his searching blue eyes. His face looks smug, but 
at the same time barely in control of a fierce temper, no matter 
what the circumstance. His build is powerful and cat-like, in 
peak condition for his gaining age. Tightly packed muscles and a 
fair amount of scar tissue do nothing to lesson or alter the mans 
dangerous appearance. The mans lips are thin and cracked, his 
eyes slightly bloodshot from lack of sleep. Pearly white teeth 
form into neat, shark-like rows that tend to make one think of a 
predator. His face is well kept and neatly shaven, his whole 
appearance tending to indicate towards a member of the 
upper-class, or perhaps someone of high stature.

a formless sentinel rogues thug prototype~
A formless sentinel rogues thug prototype is here, an imposing look on their face.~
   This person seems to have led a rougher life then the norm, 
with heavily calloused hands and fingers as well as the 
occasional scar along their body. Looking far from in perfect 
health, they most likely sustain themselves on lower quality food 
and drink, some of their teeth missing and others yellowed. 
Despite all this, they carry themselves in a firm, proud manner, 
holding their head high and their shoulders kept squared. As 
they move about they pay great attention to all that surrounds 
them, moving with a wary air.

an oversized goblin with a flattened forehead and bent ears~
An oversized goblin with a flattened forehead and bent ears stands here, grinning dumbly.~
   Pudgy and tall for a goblin this bloated chump could easily be 
mistaken for an orc, perhaps even a large one. Two red eyes 
stare from deep inside of a seemingly hollow skull mounted upon a 
flabby, thick neck. This creatures teeth have gone far beyond 
yellow and now exist in a darker shade of moldy brown. Wicked, 
cracked lips of gray split slightly around a scar to reveal a 
large gap where at least three of the teeth have been pulled, or 
perhaps knocked out. The brutes ears wrap oddly around its head, 
drawn up slightly as his face appears locked in some perpetual 
smile of idiocy.

a broad-gutted goblin with wide, circular eyes~
A broad-gutted goblin stands here, circular, red eyes searching about.~
   This goblins eyes flick about his surroundings with an intense 
interest, the large orbs taking in all around him. Somewhat 
broad, he lacks the weedy frame held by many of his kin along 
with a few of the sure signs of starvation. Knotted and gnarled 
muscles hang oddly from his arms making him look somewhat comical 
if it wasnt for the searching red eyes and numerous scars.

a squat, one-armed goblin with a piercing stare~
A squat, one-armed goblin trundles about here his eyes locked on the floor.~
   Low to the ground this goblin barely clears the four foot 
mark. Low to the ground his foot drags slightly as he walks, 
shorter then average legs having to move quickly to keep up. One 
of this goblins arms has been hewn off at on point or another 
just below the elbow. A large, white scar nearly a centimeter in 
width runs across the top of the small beasts head, likely a blow 
from a heavy bladed object such as an axe or greatsword.

A gaunt man with pale skin loiters here.~
   Gaunt and pale, this man seems to have led a rougher life than 
the norm, with heavily-calloused hands and fingers, as well as a 
generous peppering of scars about his face and arms. Far from 
perfect health, he appears to have been deprived several meals in 
his life, or to have sustained himself on low-quality food and 
drink. Despite this, however, he carries himself well, the 
short-cropped onyx hair on his head kept clean and his shoulders 
squared. As he moves about, he pays a great deal of attention to 
his surroundings, moving with a wary air.

A groomed, salt-and-pepper bearded man stands here quietly.~
   Well-kept and clean, this relatively stout man seems to take a 
fair amount of pride in his grooming. Clean, combed black hair, 
flecked with grey from age, falls to his shoulders, framing a 
beard of the same coloration. He seems to be in fairly good 
health, and carries himself in a firm, proud manner, holding his 
head high and his shoulders squared through nearly all actions 
and motions. His amber eyes seem to pay a great deal of 
attention to his surroundings, and he moves with a wary air.

Dhorall Lord wight leathery-skinned towering exposed ribcage inside Mewlip Slumberer~
a leathery-skinned, towering wight~
A towering wight with leathery skin stands here, inside of its ribcage exposed.~
   Extremely tall, this massive husk of what once was a man 
instills fear, or, at the very least, nausea in all but the 
hardiest of men. It bears itself proudly at a full seven feet 
tall, though it is much taller than it is bulky. In fact, much 
of its skin seems to have rotted off, what's left of it cracked 
and peeling like dried leather. Beneath this rests exposed 
muscle, sinew, and yellowed bone. The stomach of this creature 
has been torn out, or rotted away: all that remains is an open 
ribcage, rancid organs and putrid viscera hanging within it. The 
creature's face is mostly skeletal, bits of skull visibly cloven 
from beneath its lank black hair. Where the nose once was now 
resides a singular hole, and where the eyes once were, there is 
naught but shadow--a very unnerving and unnatural shadow, at 
that.

monster hideous long lashing many tentacles squidstress~
a hideous, many-tentacled monster~
A hideous monster with long, lashing tentacles resides here.~
   While only roughly man-sized in height, this foul and 
repugnant creature's bulk is greatly increased by the many slimy 
tentacles that sprout out from the base of its squidlike body. 
Each dotted with numerous purple suckers, the greyish skin of the 
appendages is of a similar tone and muculent look to the head of 
this abomination. A pair of oversized, oily black eyes glisten 
in any available light, bearing no discernible pupil nor iris in 
their inky depths. Rising from the creature is an odor most 
repulsive, a rancid cocktail of sewage, raw fish, and butchered 
flesh, an assault upon the nose of all but the crudest of 
creatures. Despite its awkward appearance, this squidlike 
monstrosity moves with all the silent, stealthy grace of a 
soaring eagle, being equally as fast on land as on water. On the 
underside of its pasty body, located in the center of the 
multitude of tentacles, is a large, gaping mouth lined with near 
to half a dozen rows of small, razor-sharp teeth. This creatures 
seems never quite still, constantly twitching and moving about, 
turning this way or that, and simply never, ever pausing.

an emaciated, scarlet-haired woman~
A sickly-thin woman with scarlet hair lingers here.~
   Looking as though starved and work-worn, this woman's pale, 
scarred flesh wraps tautly around her bones, only trace amounts 
of muscle and fat present on her. Her sickly-thin appendages, 
pronounced spine and ribcage, and angular facial features give 
her a skeletal, almost macabre look. Her eyes are a dark brown, 
borderline black, and contrast her pale skin sharply. A similar 
contrast is present between the skin and her hair, which is a 
lustrous, healthy dark shade of red, hanging straight without 
curl or stray strand to her upper back.

A squat, sallow-skinned man with a gleaming skull is here.~
A squat, barrel-chested man is here, his skin the color of aged
parchment. His eyes are a light, murky brown, their pupils bare
dots. There is not a touch of hair on his head, not even eyebrows.
His hands are thick and stubby, and horn-hard with calluses. The
scent of earth and iron surrounds him.

A round-faced man with smooth cheeks and graying hair is here.~
This man's round cheeks are devoid of beard of any sort, though the gray
streaks in his muddy-brown hair make it apparent that he is far too old for
one to be missing. He is a small man, with slightly-stooped shoulders and 
watery blue eyes. His hands are long and narrow, with delicate fingers and
well-trimmed nails. His stomach sags somewhat, hinting that he is getting
on in years.

   This scrappy tomcat has fur which is predominantly white in 
color, with patches of black and tan fur patterns throughout. 
The most distinctive patterning of this cat lies in a mask of 
black with tinges of red and a large red and brown patch of fur 
on its back. The cat appears to be in generally good health and 
possesses a set of yellow eyes.

   Tufts of wiry hair sprout just behind this bald man's thick, 
fleshy ears, one of which is split halfway through from the top 
of the cartilage to the thick pink whorls in the middle. Other 
signs of hard wear appear in bumps on the bridge of his pug nose 
and scars across his knuckles. He has a rough, ruddy complexion, 
the skin covered in a thin sheen of grease over the whole of his 
bloated, pig-like frame.

A grimy, unshaven man is here.~
   This man's gaunt, unshaven face is dominated by pair of dark, 
sunken eyes. His pale skin is covered in a layer of grime, and 
the thick, uneven stubble along his jawline is well on its way to 
becoming a beard. The long, scraggly brown hair covering his 
head is oily and severely matted in several places. Though his 
arms show obvious muscle, his limbs are unusally thin, the bones 
of his hands clearly outlined beneath the skin. His fingernails 
are cracked and yellow, their tips almost black with dirt.

A greasy, scar-faced man lingers here.~
   This man's large, prominent features are set low on his face, 
emphasizing a flushed, greasy forehead. This wide expanse is 
highlighted by a craggy white scar which runs from his hairline 
on the right side, down and across, between his large, dark-blue 
eyes, and out toward the tip of a fat, knobby nose which has 
clearly been broken more than a few times. His ruddy complexion 
is textured with pock marks and enormous pores, which would seem 
to be the source of his near-constant sweating. A dark crop of 
short but unkempt hair pokes out over the man's forehead and ears 
like straw. Dense muscle clings to a short, compact frame, and 
every part of him seems wide and stunted.

A pale, lanky man with long limbs stands here.~
   Standing almost a head above average, this man is lank, weedy 
and pale. His limp black hair is somewhat greasy, though it 
surely sees a bit of care here and there, and it parts in the 
middle, dangling to his jaw in a haphazard fashion. Sunken, 
water-blue eyes peer furtively out from shadows cast by his deep 
eye-sockets, and his hooked nose and chin curve ever so slightly 
toward one another in the shape of a waning moon. His shoulders 
are overly broad for the narrowness of his frame, and although 
his extremities show a subtle musculature, they hang rather 
awkwardly when he is still.

a formless slum thug prototype~
A formless slum thug prototype is here.~
   This person is brutish and dirty, their cracked teeth and 
scarred visage speaking of a lifetime of pain and poverty. 
Whether they are found prowling the slums or loitering with their 
fellows under the shadow of the Third Circle wall, they regard 
the world with cold, predatory eyes, their hands never far from 
their weapons.

a formless slum thug prototype~
A formless slum thug prototype is here.~
   This person seems to have led a rougher life then the norm, 
with heavily calloused hands and fingers as well as the 
occasional scar along their body. Looking far from in perfect 
health, they most likely sustain themselves on lower quality food 
and drink, some of their teeth missing and others yellowed. 
Despite all this, they carry themselves in a firm, proud manner, 
holding their head high and their shoulders kept squared. As 
they move about they pay great attention to all that surrounds 
them, moving with a wary air.

a crooked man with wiry muttonchops~
A man with a crooked back and wiry muttonchops is here.~
   This pasty, sunken-eyed man is perpetually hunched, a bow in 
his spine curving him forward near the middle of his back. His 
limbs are long and lean, and very little fat is visible anywhere 
on his frame, though his thinness has a certain unhealthy quality 
to it. A pointy, roughly-stubbled chin juts outs nearly as far 
as his beak nose, and a pair of wiry black muttonchops flanks his 
waning moon face.

a hunchbacked, broad-faced orc stands here~
This orc is of solid make, thick of build and and almost square-
like in shape. He stands bent forward, apparently by suffering 
from the the bend of his neck and shoulders that are swollen 
into a hunch. The face is broad and thick, and holds a confident 
gleam in the eyes.

Fat, is the best way to describe this orc. It has a big belly, 
thick flabby arms and massive lecks, and the neck is so thick 
it almost looks like the head sits directly on the shoulders.

A disfigured goblin stands here~
This little goblin has been burnt beyond recognition. It's face 
is completely disfigured, lacking lips, nose and with one large 
wrinkled scar replacing the skin on head and neck. The eyes 
are small, narrow and red. Burning as if the fire left it's 
hatred inside the creature's soul.

a small, scrawny child~
A small, scrawny child wanders aimlessly about.~
   This scrawny child can't be more than a few years old, her 
slender body small and somewhat frail. Wide hazel eyes dominate 
a face that is both delicate and gaunt, and her long hair is oily 
and extremely dishevelled. Numerous scars and scabs are visible 
on her arms and legs, though most of her skin is covered in dirt 
and grime, and a pungent, rotten smell hangs about her.

A small child, thin and dirty, is standing here.~
   Oily, matted hair falls over this small child's eyes and down 
around his ears. Lice, or some other wriggly parasites, can be 
seen crawling over his thin body. His limbs are scrawny, with 
dark bruises across much of his face and arms. A thick layer of 
dirt covers most of his skin. The smell that surrounds him is 
strong and sharp, and is reminiscent of rotten things.

An old, scraggly-haired woman with close-set blue eyes is here.~
   Dirt covers most of this woman's body. The smell that clings 
to her is strong and pungent, the odor consisting mostly of sweat 
and rot. Her scraggly grey hair is oily and somewhat matted, and 
now and again small, wriggling creatures are visible crawling 
within the thickly tangled strands. Her eyes, wide and blue, are 
set close together on a face that is gaunt and heavily wrinkled. 
Her thin lips are cracked and peeling, and a number of dark, 
crusty moles adorn her cheeks and chin.
