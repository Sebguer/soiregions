Mack barkeep AMDIR_CHOW_HALL_MERCHANT fat greasy hairy-armed man byCONSCRIPT shopkeep~
a fat, greasy, hairy-armed man~
A fat, greasy, hairy-armed man stands behind a table holding a ladle.~
   An ample gut hanging over his belt, this man perspires 
profusely as he serves the soldiers, slopping food on their 
plates without much regard for anything save getting to the next 
man in line. His sleeves, rolled to just below his elbows, 
reveal fat forearms well coated with grease and red hair. His 
jowls wobble whenever he moves, and he is given to short and 
frequent bursts of profanity, often waving his ladle about 
threateningly.

A bent, wiry, bald little man minds the counter.~
   A think rim of whispy white hair circles this industrious 
little man's head just above his ears, his bald pate reflecting 
the lantern light above his head. He hums and mutters to himself 
as he works, peering at items with a magnifying lens, sorting 
through stacks of furs, or prying at the bark of logs to check 
the soundness of the underlying wood.

A cheery, chubby shopkeeper bustles about the store.~

quick to greet those who enter his store. Though his hair is 
darker, sandy brown, the resemblance between this man and the boy

a short, bald man with a scraggly white beard~
A short, bald man with a scraggly white beard tends to the counter.~
   This spry little man is quick to greet any who come in his 
shop. He has bright eyes and an infectious laugh, and given the 
least provocation, will start telling stories about his days as a 
scout long ago. His skin is wrinkled and the backs of his hands 
are covered with age spots. His crinkly-looking beard shows no 
sign of diminishing with age, though it is snowy white.

A handsome young man with a rakish grin tends the bar.~
   This outgoing young man looks to be in his early twenties, and 
seems to take a lot of care with his appearance. His nails are 
clean and well trimmed, and never a hair is out of place. His 
eyes are a startling shade of blue that contrast vividly with his 
wavy black hair. He is jovial with his male customers but is 
particularly solicitous with women who frequent the tavern.

a short, bow-legged man~
A short, bow-legged man tends the horses here.~
   This short, wiry man's patchy beard is grizzled, and his hands 
seem too big for his body, broadened and calloused by work. With 
a dramatic bow to his legs, he seems to roll when he walks, and 
he is missing a great many teeth. His dark eyes are bright with 
humor, and he is given to bantering with those who are not so 
high ranking as to take offense.

A small, grubby boy lazes about the stable.~
   A smattering of freckles and oversized front teeth give this 
lad an impish grin as he lazes about the stable, dodging from 
time to time a well-aimed kick or a thrown brush from the men 
working there. He is always grubby from his unkempt blond hair 
down to his bare feet.

   This tall, spare officer commands the dock with a stern

A black-eyed man whose blue-black hair is speckled with white directs the crane crew.~
   The commander of the crane squad shouts his orders roughly, 
and any man who moves too slow is likely to catch a boot in the 
rump. He is a stocky man, barrel-chested, with large, calloused 
hands and a rolling gate. His eyes are black and quick to find 
any soldier lazing. His square-face is framed by closely shorn 
hair, so black it appears blueish at times.

and replaced with a rod of wood, intricately carved with nautical

a blond-haired, blue-eyed officer~
A blond-haired, blue-eyed officer minds the door here.~
   Of average height, perhaps a touch shorter, this man seems 
nearly square, his shoulders and chest are so muscled. His neck 
is thick, as are his limbs. A shock of unruly yellow hair peeks 
from beneath his helm, and his beard is a shade darker.

a middle-aged man with dark brown hair~
A middle-aged soldier with dark brown hair guards the gate.~
   This man's dark brown hair is just beginning to grey, though 
he seems to be approaching fifty. Light brown eyes peer from a 
weathered face, and he sports the collection of scars that is 
common for lifelong soldiers. Nearly six feet tall, he is heavy 
about the chest and shoulders, and bears himself with erect 
posture.

A bulky, blond man with hazel eyes guards the cells.~
   The jailer is a grim sort, not given to gentleness. Though he 
is not cruel without reason, he seems to be the sort to enjoy it 
if a prisoner gives him an excuse to do a bit of thrashing. A 
hefty man, he is thick limbed and thick necked, and his blond 
hair is clipped nearly to the scalp.

   Grey eyes set in a stern, austere visage note everything that 
happens on this ship. His hands steady on the wheel, he seems,

pale, is still weathered by the elements, and there are crowsfeet 
at the corners of his eyes from squinting against the sun on the 
water.

Gondrenhun tall obsidian haired byHalfjack DALAMIR_500~
a tall, obsidian-haired man~
A tall, obsidian-haired man is here.~
   Distinguished and highly defined features give this man a 
regal, respectable appearance. His brows are high and arched, as 
well as very thin and a stark contrast in their black coloration 
to the pale, almost pallid skin of his face. His cheekbones, 
already high and pronounced seem to be given further emphasis by 
the gauntness of his face, and the hollowed appearance of his 
cheeks, and his sunken, stone-grey eyes. An efficient pony-tail 
holds back his mid-back length hair, revealing a distinct widows 
peak as his hairline recedes. His pale skin is scarred and 
calloused, with the most noticeable wound being a poorly healed 
scar from just under his left eye, down past his jaw. His tall, 
lean frame is hunched, and his age reveals itself in the lines on 
his face as well as his permanently baggy eyes.

A tall, clouded-grey eyed man is here.~
   A large frame is the defining point of this man. He stands 
tall, with broad shoulders, and a muscular upper body. Though 
his muscles are powerful, they lack a toned definition. His pale 
skin is almost completely unblemished, excepting his hands, which 
have developed small calouses, and are worn and weathered. His 
head is crowned by carefully cut, black hair that extends down to 
his shoulders. His eyes are a muted grey, matching an overcast 
sky in their coloration.

Holdliehan pofHrimsen rangy powerful dapple gray stallion byHalfjack~
a rangy, powerfully built dapple gray stallion~
A rangy, yet powerfully built dapple gray stallion resides here.~
   Standing just past eighteen hands at the withers, this fully 
mature dapple gray stallion sports a pair of intelligent, 
wide-set dark eyes. From the taut muscles rippling beneath its 
black skin and white-patterned coat along its hindquarters to a 
full mouth and broad, flaring hooves, it would seem to be in its 
prime. Corresponding to the ring-shaped markings across the 
barrel, the shaggy mane and tail are a silvery-white while the 
lower portions of its legs begin to show more of its dark skin as 
the dapple pattern tapers off just below the knees and hocks. 
The legs themselves are well built and well maintained, 
furthering the powerful and hearty look of the beast.

a tall young man with sandy-brown hair~
A tall young man with sandy-brown hair is here.~
   The sandy-brown hair of this young man is shorn short, only 
about an inch in length. Despite that, it has accumulated enough 
grease to bend easily to the will of the last thing that 
positions it. And stay bent as such. His face is faintly 
elongated, with a prominent chin, which bears a rather recent cut 
from its center, all the way up to his right eye. Thin eyebrows 
are positioned over his bluish-grey eyes, with a rather thick 
nose between them. His frame is tall, but lacks a notable amount 
of fat or muscle. Despite that, he is clearly relatively strong, 
if only due to his heritage, and not his excercises.

Vincent thick necked man rough goatee POF_ORODIR qDeacon~
a thick-necked man with a rough goatee~
A thick-necked man with a rough goatee is here.~
   Seen from the front, this man's neck is as wide as his 
face--and he has a pretty wide face. He has a short crop of 
curly black hair that comes down to a very small widow's peak. 
His dark eyebrows are bushy and thick. His eyes are wide-spaced 
on his large face and are dark brown. His nose is also wide, and 
the nostrils flare up slightly at the ends. His lips are pale 
but otherwise unremarkable. His entire face is covered with 
stubble, but it has been cut off pretty close to his face except 
around his mouth, leaving a rough sort of goatee. He has two 
cauliflower ears, and his skin is tough and pock-marked. His 
nose, upon careful inspection, is canted at a slight angle. He 
is taller than average, and much bigger--large and muscular. His 
hands are thick, tough, and capable-looking. As he stands, both 
his arms and legs curve outward at the elbows and knees. Because 
of his clothing, it is hard to tell if this is simply posturing 
or an actual imbalance in his muscle tone.

A jade-eyed little girl with tawny curls is here.~
   Healthily plump, this young girl has a round-cheeked face with 
a dimpled chin and creamy fair skin. A little snub nose turns up 
at the end, spattered with pale brown freckles that fade out as 
they spread outwards along her cheekbones. Dark jade green in 
color, her wide eyes have little flecks of gray and long, thick 
lashes. Her hair is a warm golden-brown, riotous curls that 
tangle all around her face in little ringlets, picking up coppery 
hints in the light.

A delicate, smoky-eyed little girl plays here.~
   This young girl is slight and delicate of build. Her 
smoke-colored eyes are bright and filled with wonder. Her head 
is covered with a cap of straight hair in ebon hue, reaching just 
to the bottom of her jaw. Her chubby fingers are quite dexterous 
and she is often caught fiddling with something, be it button, 
toy or her own hair. She is smaller than is perhaps normal, but 
perfect in her petiteness. Her skin is the color of fresh cream, 
tinged with rose across the swell of her cheeks, matching the 
pale pink of her lips. Her features are delicate and achingly 
sweet, a promise of great beauty yet to come.

A midnight-haired boy with eyes of flint-grey is here.~
   Small and sturdy, this young boy has large eyes the dark grey 
of flint that lock eagerly onto the sights around him. Straight 
midnight hair crowns his head in a handsome contrast to his 
creamy skin. A faint pallor underlies the shade of his flesh and 
his face has a thin quality unusual in such a young child. His 
lips, however, are rosy in hue and curve easily into a smile even 
in repose.

A bright-eyed boy with ebon curls is here.~
   Bright eyes the color of flint and speckled with reflective 
flecks nearly silver in shade peer curiously at the world from 
under this boy's head of tumbling ebon curls. He is slender of 
form and tall for his age, with long fingers and large feet 
promising growth yet to come. Seldom still, his attention 
wanders anywhere and everywhere all at once. His skin is pale 
with pale pink flushing his cheeks, his aristocratic nose, and 
matching the hue of his stubbornly set thin lips.

a slim young maid with nut-brown eyes~
A slim young maid with nut-brown eyes is busy about her chores.~
   Lines beneath large, nut-brown eyes belie this woman's 
youthful visage, a testament to what ever life she may have led 
in the past. A thin face framed by shoulder-length mousy hair 
bears fair features, lending her a vaguely haunted beauty, a hint 
of weariness lingering about her even when her thin lips find 
themselves turned upward. Her frame is scant and her stature a 
bit shorter than average, but she bears herself mostly upright 
and carries with her a pleasant enough demeanor, with a ready 
smile for those who greet her.

a tiny calico kitten with blue eyes~
A tiny calico kitten with blue eyes is here.~
   This kitten is quite small even for being so young, likely the 
runt of the litter. Her eyes are huge and still a milky blue, 
just a little too large for her face. Her nose is bright pink 
and surrounded by long, drooping pure white whiskers. Between 
her eyes and covering her muzzle is a patch of golden brown 
marked with lighter cream, which comes to a point on her 
forehead. As is common for the breed, her markings are 
asymmetrical, looking as if she were splashed with different 
colours of paint. Her throat and chin are white marked with 
small inclusions of cream, and all four of her paws are white. 
Large ears are, like most of the rest of her, black, but the tips 
are gold, with tiny tufts of fur that stick out. Her back is 
patterned with all three colours besides the dominant ebony, and 
her long tail is part gold at the base, black in the middle, and 
tipped in white.

a sage-eyed lad with coarse black hair~
A sage-eyed lad with coarse black hair stands here.~
   This lanky lad stands at an average height, with somewhat 
knobbly knees and elbows upon willowy limbs, ending in hands and 
feet which appear just slightly too large. Coarse black hair 
falls to a crude cut just above his shoulders and frames a 
pointed, sallow face marked with round, deep sage-coloured eyes 
and thin lips. Each of his features bears marks of evident 
youth, and his wiry muscle is yet undeveloped.

Korak adult raven large glossy black bird xpofTersi xNauriel~
a large, glossy black raven~
A large black raven struts about here.~
   This large bird is sooty black from his thick, gently curved 
beak, to the tips of his dual-clawed toes. His feathers are 
shiny and smooth down the lines of his back and sweeping wings. 
The feathers under his wickedly sharp beak and down his neck are 
more ruffled, giving him a faintly unkempt appearance. Scaly, 
skinny legs end in three-toed feet, with a dewclaw on the back. 
The flexibility of the toes and the two talons on each make for 
surprising dexterity, easily picking up objects for examination 
by ebon beak and gleaming eyes. His tail folds together when at 
rest, only fanning out when he takes to the air.

an aging, large black raven~
An old black raven broods here.~
   This large bird is a slightly-faded black from his thick, 
gently curved beak, to the tips of his dual-clawed toes. His 
feathers are shiny and smooth down the lines of his back and 
sweeping wings. The feathers under his still-sharp beak and down 
his neck are more ruffled, giving him a faintly unkempt 
appearance, some of the color faded. Scaly, skinny legs end in 
three-toed feet, with a dewclaw on the back. The flexibility of 
the toes and the two talons on each make for surprising 
dexterity, easily picking up objects for examination by ebon beak 
and gleaming eyes. His tail folds together when at rest, only 
fanning out when he takes to the air. The feathers around his 
still-bright eyes have faded to a dark grey, adding to the 
impression of the bird's advanced age.

a snow-white destrier~
A snow-white destrier is here, whickering softly.~
   This destrier may not be the largest of warhorses, but he 
certainly isn't small by any means, still much larger than the 
average riding horse. He stands around sixteen hands tall at the 
withers and carries the girth of muscle to match his height. His 
coat is a snowy-white in color, as is his mane, and two dark eyes 
are set on the sides of his head. Despite his considerable 
stature, he carries himself with calm and quiet and well-trained 
manner.

A burly man with golden tresses~
   Broad shoulders and a toned physique mark the tall form of 
this middle-aged man. A war-scarred and weathered face bearing a 
pair of ice blue eyes and a slightly large nose is framed by 
strands of healthy, if somewhat coarse golden hair, the majority 
of which is held back by a strip of leather. His skin is tanned 
and somewhat roughened by the elements.

A twiggy, owl-eyed damsel is here.~
   The most prominent feature on this scrawny girl's freckled 
visage are her owl-like deep brown eyes that peer out from above 
a tiny nose and thin, pale lips. Lank, unkempt ashy hair falls 
into her face and unevenly around her thin shoulders, which slump 
slightly forward and emphasize her short stature. Faint, whitish 
scars of various sizes adorn her pale limbs here and there, and 
when she smiles, she reveals a slight gap in her front teeth.

A lithe, midnight-tressed woman lingers here.~
   Midnight black hair with a slight wave contrasts vividly 
against the pale skin of this woman's face. Eyes of dark grey 
shine with the luminance of intelligence and curiosity. Her chin 
is strong with a stubborn set and her lips are somewhat thin and 
aristocratic in shape. The rest of her figure is slender, 
demonstrating a life of apparent ease.

A bespeckled grey mare with feathered hooves stands here.~
   This horse stands on four strong legs at roughly fourteen or 
fifteen hands. Her coat is a shadowy grey, with numerous white 
spots; it looks as if one took a paint brush and simply 
splattered her flanks and back with white. Her mane is that same 
shade of white, as are the feathery tufts of hair about her 
hooves. Her two eyes are dark, but kind and gentle, and they 
belay no hostility or wildness whatsoever. She bears a calm 
demeanor, as one trained for riding.

A young woman with a head full of onyx curls stands here.~
   This young woman bears a mop of curly onyx tresses that would 
fall just past her shoulders if let loose but are more often than 
not held back by a simple leather strip into a simple, puffy 
ponytail at the back of her head. Her eyes are a silver grey, 
standing out in a pale, somewhat pointed face, upon which the 
most prominent feature is a scar running from the far corner of 
her left eye in a curve along her cheek to end just beside her 
chin. Her frame is wiry and athletic, with many more scars 
marring her pallid skin.

a lanky woman with silver-streaked onyx hair~
A lanky woman stands here, her onyx-hued hair streaked with silver.~
   This woman stands tall and slim, her limbs somewhat lanky and 
her skin somewhat roughened from years of labour and toil in the 
sun. She has a full head of thick, onyx-hued tresses that bear 
very thin tendrils of silver here and there, an indicator of her 
age when coupled with the lines of laughter and worry etched 
lightly into her otherwise soft features. Deep blue eyes peer 
out from above a slightly crooked nose and full lips, which 
conceal mostly straight, slightly yellowed teeth. While she may 
have been a striking beauty in the years before age began to 
creep into her appearance, it seems that time has begun to wear 
upon her.

A man with crimson hair stands here spattered in freckles.~
   This tall, brawny man is quite pale, with copper-coloured 
freckles covering every inch of visible skin, concentrated 
heavily over his nose and cheeks. Above his blunt nose rest a 
pair of lead grey eyes, and above those is a mop of somewhat 
unkempt red hair that rests tousled around his somewhat overlarge 
ears. Broad shoulders lead to beefy arms, a barrel chest, and 
sturdy legs, hands quite rough and calloused and fingernails 
dirty.
