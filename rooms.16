A Hastily Built Warehouse~
   The original purpose of this large area cannot be discerned 
from the efforts taken at transforming it into an operating, 
field depot. All interior walls have been demolished and the 
roof sustained with large, roughly-finished wooden beams. 
The harsh stone floor is laid bare, and seems to already have 
endured a large amount of abuse, bearing a chipped, flaky 
surface, victim to much traffic by foot and hoof. What must
have been the entrance to this place has been tore down 
hastily, to allow the passage of wagons and carts. An overall
sense of chaos and disorder fills the warehouse, with so 
many items scattered inside, which, nonetheless, have a sort 
of logic to them, as they are grouped with some intent 
behind it. The only exit is through the demolished wall south.

Crossing of Roads East of the Barred City Gates~
   An enlarged square of black and white cobblestones has been 
placed here with roads joining from the north, south and east, an 
iron portcullis set in the city wall westwards. The portcullis has
been lowered and a set of thick, iron chains cross entwine on its
lenght, shutting it down. A wide, solid barricade of logs has been 
set in front of the portcullis, shutting any chance to reach the
portcullis. Behind these two obstacles, the great western gate
of Osgiliath has been closed shut and apparently barred, 
forbidding passage into the Anorien. Four cast-iron lamp 
posts, rusted with old age but still able to bear light in the 
darkness, have been set in each of the four corners of this 
crossroads.

The Burned-Out Shell of a Field Hospital~
   This room is nothing but a collection of smoky, fiery stains, 
large scorch marks, and collapsed and burned wood. Larged hunks 
of stone from the eastern and northern walls litter the floor, 
and many burned corpses of both humans and rats cover the floor 
underfoot.

A Small Storage and Bedroom~
   This small, simple room must have been some sort of
bedroom in the past of this building, but now serves simply as
a storage room for the medical supplies the hospital uses, and
as a poor respite from the unending needs of the injured to
the south. A few bins and a bed are set around, used for the
needs of the healers. No window is set in the walls, but a poor,
sputtering brass lantern has been affixed to the western wall,
shedding a hesitant light into the gloomy area. The only
exit is through the door to the south, back into the Hospital.

New Room~
   This street of Osgiliath is empty, disturbingly so; farming 
produce lays rotting in the streets, as does uncollected refuse. 
Lanterns and lamp posts are untended, the glass smashed. The 
buidlings that line the street are either boarded up, looted, or 
but a blackened stone shell. A smoky pallour of soot and haze 
often hangs in the air, drifting in from the east. An eerie 
silence, disturbed only by the rare person to walk through, 
pervades the abandoned and ruined buildings of Osgiliath.
