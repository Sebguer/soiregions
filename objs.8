a humanoid skeleton~
A humanoid skeleton rests here, slumped against the cavern wall.~
   This skeleton is completely devoid of flesh or tissue, the 
bones themselves brittle and aged. Hair however, yet remains, 
showing long hair and a thick flowing beard, now twisted and 
matted. The head is a bit large for its body, which at full 
height is probably only half as tall as a typical man.

   Perched atop three rough stone blocks, this table was once a 
millstone. The lower portion has been removed, ensuring that it 
will never work again for its original purpose, and allowing 
chairs or stools to be pulled up to it. A hole in the center of 
the stone allows a thick wooden pole to pass through, which must 
have turned the thing in times past. Now, however, it stands 
motionless.

at the neck, to expose quite a bit of the cleavage of the wearer 
and is partially see-through, due to its gossamer texture. The 
lower hem has been cut diagonally, so the right side is longer 
than the left, exposing more of the wearer's left leg. It is 
very light and form-fitting.

in place. Two stout pine logs stand astride the stone structure 
and hold a thatched roof protectively over it. Another stout log 
acts as a cross-member between the two vertical logs as well as 
support for a pulley that hangs from its center. A long rope, 
knotted at one end and spliced to the handle of a wooden bucket 
at the other has been threaded through the pulley. Looking down 
into the well, one would note it is rather deep and the stones 
are smooth and moss covered.

been built for damage instead of ornamentation. The blade is 
long, broad and razor sharp. The top of the dagger hooks 
backward in a wave-like shape almost as if the tip was bent back, 
but is very noticably made that way specifically to greatly 
increase a puncture wound from this weapon. The hilt has been 
made out of a high quality bronze and wrapped in a sticky leather 
for increased grip. The crossguard is wide, extended out for 
greater protection of the user's hand.

A cluster of mature, fine Ruby Grace grapes lies here.~
   This cluster is pretty large, being twice the length of a 
common man's hand. The grapes are deeply purple and dark, and 
seem healthy and savory. With a sweet taste, these grapes are 
the ones commonly used for wines produced in the Anorien region 
of Gondor. Unlike the more common kind of grapes, these seem 
more dark and firm, possibly the effect of some effort made to 
turn these into a more valuable fruit.

A long, vicious blue-grey-hued scythe has been left here, the blade adorned with a dragon-head motif.~
   Crafted of a masterful watery-steel, this scythe was forged to 
perfection. The shaft is curved perfectly to suit the user's 
comfortability and maneuverability. The shaft is a darker 
blue-grey hue, which matches with the lighter blue-grey that the 
blade and counterweight have. The broad blade of the scythe has 
been shaped to the form of a dragon head, the snout being the 
bulk of the blade. The etchings and runes on the scythe are 
flawless, as is the viciously sharp edge which has a bone-white 
sheen.

   The guards tell you that only Astirian Villeins holding a 
valid hunting license or certificate in their hands are permitted 
through the gate to the mountains, due to the grave dangers 
above. 
   If you wish to pass, use the "show hunting" command while 
holding a valid license which can be obtained in the Pelennor 
bastion. Be aware that only Villeins will be permitted to pass.

A straight bronze key has been left here.~
   This key is reasonably new, not yet tarnished by time or 
overuse. It is rather simple, with only a few teeth and a small 
circular handle which can be easily fitted onto a thong or 
keyring. While not heavy, it has a substantial feel.

There is a rope ladder here, its fibers slightly frayed.~
   This ladder has been made from lengths of thick rope, tied 
every few handspans to the ends of wooden planks. Secured from 
above, it doesn't seem very stable. The materials used in its 
construction appear to be old and worn, the frayed fibers and 
splintered boards an indication of its durability.

The end of a swinging rope bridge is attached here.~
   This bridge has been made from lengths of thick rope, tied 
every few handspans to more lengths of twisted rope that hold up 
the ends of wooden planks. It is secured at this end by massive 
iron rings, driven deep into the stone. It doesn't seem very 
stable, swaying in the wind, and swinging ever more when it is 
traversed. The materials used in its construction appear to be 
worn and frayed, the fibers and splintered boards hinting at old 
age. It is unclear if the bridge is attached at the other end or 
is just swinging in the wind.

The following commands may be used to check the Pelennor
Bastion treasury and transfer an erin at a time to the hands
of the Warden who uses them. Present here is a board. A
Warden transferring money must leave word here that they have
done so and why. Wardens may also use this board for posts
that concern the Wardens only. Please do not use it to
leave messages for the Chief Warden.
Commands:
"check funds" - you are shown the receipt summary for the
Bastion. Please note that as of this note being placed,
there will be no more coin -spent- only coin made as pure
profit.
"transfer erin" - If an erin is present to be collected,
use this command to transfer it your hand. You -must- leave
a message on the board that you have done so. This is
your annual budget in that treasury, so please confer with
the other Wardens to plan in advance what you will do
with it.

"tally funds" - Just look at the coin total available.

Large bright grey-blue eyes survey the outside world with a 
solemn wisdom, which disappears whenever his ready chuckles 
emerge. He has a long, lean frame, standing fairly tall for his 
age. His skin is pale, soft and downy, emphasising his rosy lips 
and cheeks. He wears a jerkin, britches and a pair of carefully 
stitched kidskin shoes.

of lines across the vest, partivularly along the seam lines. The 
shoulders feature cap sleeves, short ones with a slightly-rolled 
brim, and the neckline is v-shaped with a contrasting edging that 
is also diamond punched. The vest closes down the front with 
fabric-wrapped buttons and a brawny, flexed bicep has been boldly 
embroidered in glossy, black thread upon the chest of this vest. 
It is enough to protect blows from practice weapons, but those of 
real ones would do the wearer extreme damage.

serious damage. A diamond pattern has been stitched across the 
surface of the leggings, only broken by the bisected bones of 
heavy, rolled cotton mounted to the outside edges of the leggings 
which helps to redirect attacks. Upon the upper, right-hand hip 
of the leggings, the image of a flexed bicep has been boldly 
embroidered in black thread.

appear to be quite old as mold has set over them in various 
areas, giving it a greenish tinge. Various forest life is shown 
upon it, though amongst the tranquility of the depictions a black 
sheep stands out: a humanoid figure, stooped over. It would 
appear as if a child has drawn it, large, sharp teeth casting its 
mouth into a perverse grin. Its hands are clawed into talons and 
everything else in the drawings shy away from it.

to have once had writing but now all has been lost as the paper 
is hardened from the water and the only legible words are that of 
the name 'Astirian' and the word 'Tower.' Tucked inside the book, 
however, are many sheafs of paper as if purposely hidden between

oblong stone has been so weathered by the elements as to have a 
certain softness to its rolling curves. Thin, bluish lichen has 
found purchase on the shadowed northern side, speckling the stone 
as the years pass. Careful inspection, or the slanting shadows 
of twilight, reveals that cunning hands have inscribed the rock 
with shapes, though now they are so weather-worn as to be 
difficult to descry. Swirling, interlaced knotwork marches the 
full circumference of the monolith, twining through vine-like 
curves and sweeping loops.

a large sleeping pallet of rabbit furs~
A large, comfortable pallet of rabbit furs rests on the floor here.~
   Ranging in color from grey, to black, to soft chocolate brown, 
numerous rabbit pelts have been stitched together to form this 
large, comfortable looking sleeping pallet of hides. Expertly 
tanned to leave the soft fur intact, each hide has been joined 
with imbedded stitching to leave it feeling seamless to the 
touch, creating the textured illusion of one massive hide, two or 
three inches thick. Certainly not a bed, it nevertheless looks 
capable of providing a good night's sleep with extreme comfort.

A pine trunk set in the ground here, a bundle of oil-soaked firewood tied to the top. The Warden protects a bundle of oil-soaked arrows nearby.~
   This pine trunk stretches at least twelve feet above the 
ground and is set firmly into a hole near the entrance to the 
compound. The branches and twigs tied in place at the top of 
this beacon would require a flaming arrow to be shot into them to 
set fire. 

A bundle of arrows is set near the Warden. You will need to hold 
a flint and tinder kit and use "light fire" to use this beacon. 
The Wardenry will not be pleased if it is misused.

shape. About the outside of each piece of the armour, a thin 
metal rod has been inserted into a fold of boiled leather to 
create a suit of armour that will hold its shape over time.

   This fog seethes and almost seems to boil inside its own 
boundaries as one looks at it, expanding and covering the entire 
area. The nightmarish fumes hang at perhaps waist level and are 
thick enough that, after stepping inside them, occlude any sight 
past perhaps the thigh. The faint scent of decaying, rotting 
matter is the companion of this phenomenon and, paired together 
this way, they are a foreboding duo indeed.

   This baby boy is rather large for his age giving him the 
appearance of being several months older than he actually is. 
His body is podgy, a soft layer of fat protecting his baby frame 
and pronounced by the folds in his arms and legs. Nearly bald, 
soft sparse strawberry blond hair wisps about in no real 
direction. His eyes are wide and round but narrow and tapper off 
on the outside corners. The dark cobalt blue hues often gaze 
about curiously taking in the surroundings. He has full, pouty 
lips that quiver when he cries and two small dimples in his 
chubby cheeks that are visible when he smiles.

#1A forest of nightmare-black mushrooms with spiked, dagger-like exteriors is here covering the entirety of the cavern in an undulating, black mass.#0~
   The mushrooms that compose this strange forest stand between 
five and seven feet tall, with both stalks and caps an utter, 
pitch black. The top of these mushrooms, rather than being 
smooth and soft to the touch, is incredibly jagged and rocky 
almost, with the dagger-like protrusions reaching the length of 
some ten or twelve inches from the top of the cap. Rather than 
having their roots sink down into the stone like their 
above-ground cousins, each individual mushrooms' roots lead to 
its neighbor in a large, interlocking tangle. The majority of 
the cavern's floor is covered in these roots, each one as thick 
as a grown man's wrist or forearm. At routine intervals, each 
and every mushroom in the whole of this broad cavern seems to 
draw itself upwards with an inhalation of air, hold still for a 
heartbeat, and then sigh, a rush of black air roiling from the 
plant. Between the intense, thick blackness of the area and the 
serpentine nest of roots along the floor, transversing this mass 
is an intense venture indeed.

   This baby boy has a mane of thick dark red hair and often a 
few strands seem to stick right up on his head. His bright, big, 
round hazel eyes peer out at the world, glimmering with a quiet 
sparkle that conveys a feeling of innocent curiosity. Smooth 
skin, light and creamy is drawn over the soft plumpness all 
healthy young babies seem to be gifted with. Chubby cheeks add a 
certain cuteness to this babies face which, when graced with a 
smile reveals small dimples only adding to the affect. Often 
found within a thoughtful silence this baby can still easily be 
tempted into a happy chuckle or upset cry.

A finely made, broad-bladed longsword shines from the ground here.~
   Forged by a master's hand, this weapon seems fashioned almost 
strictly for lethality. Made of steel, the metal shines with a 
pale and cold quality when light touches it. The sword is a hint 
over three feet in length. A dramatic, double fuller runs the 
length of the blade. With superior balance, the weapon's edges 
and rounded tip have been sharpened to a razored edge. The hilt 
has been wrapped tightly in fine, black leather cord and is 
crested by a silvered cross-guard. The only marks on the blade 
are engraved on the circular, weighted pommel: a regal hawk with 
wide-spread wings, etched to an amazing detail. Fashioned of 
extremely high-quality steel and flawlessly balanced make this 
blade a marvel to wield; an extremely mortal weapon in the hands 
of a skilled user.

the dome. Similar branches cross horizontally round the 
circumference, making it more sturdy to the elements. Packed in 
between is a thick layer of mud and on top of that lies straw, 
woven around the wooden frame to create a quite efficient 
waterproof outer layer. At the top a smoke hole opens up to the 
skies and it bears a simple, wooden door which is somewhat 
shorter than the average person.

guard the hand of the holder. The handle grip extends so that if 
needed the lance can be gripped by both hands.

a deadly sharp spear of steel and hardwood~
A spear with a sharp steel tip and a hardwood shaft lies here.~
   This spear is comprised of a medium-length shaft of some very 
hard wood, and a tip made of bright steel. The business end of 
the weapon is the long, sharp spearhead, with both the tip and 
edges sharpened, allowing for it to be used both to thrust and to 
slash. The shaft is made of wood; it is hard and darkened, 
though it is not immediately apparent whether that quality is 
derived from the wood itself or some treatment that it has 
undergone. The medium length of the shaft makes it light enough 
to be used with only one hand, but also long enough to be used in 
both hands. A small engraving of a fierce-eyed raven where the 
tip attaches to the shaft identifies the maker.

   This full-length, hooded robe is sewn of a dense, rich woolen 
fabric, billowing with many folds and drapes. The cloth is died 
a dusky, midnight blue, and is brocaded with fine thread of a 
similar tone, the surface of the garment crawling with an almost 
invisible, elegant design of winding lines. Broad bands along 
the hem of the garment are woven with fabric of an even darker 
hue, the subtle pattern of the weaving now worn with age. The 
robe is open-fronted, its sleeves voluminous, though not 
cumbersome. The garment has clearly survived extensive use, its 
lower lengths spattered with dried mud.

   The underbody of this cuirass is fashioned of a single, rigid 
piece of boiled leather, thick and firmly-moulded. About the 
armor, cords of dark braided leather have been wound in broad, 
intersecting, upward-slanting bands, riveted firmly to the 
cuir-bouilli frame beneath. Thick, four-lamed spaulders of 
hardened leather rest on either shoulder, chased with a faded 
wave design. Slender faulds of banded leather descend from the 
bottom of the cuirass to guard the wearer's thighs. Though 
well-maintained, the armor has evidently seen some use; several 
of its tightly-wound coils are frayed, while others have been 
meticulously restitched.

granting a good amount of shade while still allowing one to see. 
A little ribbon of matching, yellow cording allows one to tie the 
hat in place atop one's head.

A pair of cord-twined, smoky leaden greaves lies here.~
   The bodies of these well made greaves are fashioned of hard, 
smoky metal of a leaden tone, and are expertly moulded and fitted 
to form. Emering from the surface of either greave are coiled 
bands of the same cloudy substance, bound fast to the solid frame 
below. The upper and lower edges of the greaves are lightly 
embossed with a pattern of rolling waves. Both greaves stretch 
from knee to ankle. The metal that composes the greaves has a 
distinctly unnatural, otherworldly quality to it.

   Rigid plates of cloudy metal are fastened together in an 
articulated fashion to form the sturdy frames of these unique 
gauntlets, which have evidently been designed to offer the 
highest possible level of protection while preserving the 
wearer's freedom of movement. From wrist to tip, either gauntlet 
is ribbed with bumpy metallic coils. At the palm of either 
glove, the coils curl delicately into a spiral, meeting at a 
central point. The metal that composes the gauntlets has a 
distinctly unnatural, otherworldly quality to it.

A coiled gorget of misty grey metal is set here.~
   This fine gorget is composed of a pair of form-fitted pieces 
of rigid misty grey metal, buckled together to encircle the 
wearer's neck. The front of the gorget tapers gradually into a 
point, designed to tuck down toward the chest. Emerging from the 
surface of the gorget are diagonal bands of coiled metal, 
criss-crossing the armor from left to right to offer an 
additional layer of protection. The gorget's collar is chased 
with a delicate spiral and wave design. The metal that composes 
the gorget has a distinctly unnatural, otherworldly quality to

   It is a long, cylindrical spike of solid silver, which tapers 
into a slender ridge at either end. Dense, translucent ice coats 
the entirety of the weapon, crystalline and rigidly edged. The 
silver beneath is lit with a ghostly light, and gleams white with 
frost. The shaft exudes a numbing aura of frigidity, seeming 
deathly cold to the touch - it smokes lightly in the open air, 
thin, coiled vapours drifting from its glacial surface.

A flowing, silken cloak of shadowed hues lies here.~
   A smooth fall of soft fabric that reaches nearly to the 
ankles, this cloak drapes from the shoulders and enfolds the 
body. The material is silken in nature, soft and light yet 
strangely warm for its weight. It is difficult to say what 
colour the cloak is: grey with the hue of twilight, yet in 
another light it seems green as shadowed leaves or brown as 
fallow fields by night. A deep, lined hood of the same silken 
material falls back from the shoulders and, when raised, the 
cloak veils the wearer entirely. The clasp, a gently curved, 
cunningly wrought eagle feather of bronze with inlaid golden 
highlights upon the barbs so cunningly crafted that the feather 
appears lifelike, pins the cloak upon the right breast, fixing 
the garment securely together.

fur to provide superior comfort and warmth. The thicker outer 
layer has been meticulously hardened to strengthen the boots, 
encasing the wearer's foot protectively when worn. An intricate 
design of climbing ivy has been tooled upon the exterior, twining 
from the boot's toe to where they end at mid-calf and then dyed a 
foresty-green. Shapely and contoured, these boots have obviously 
been custom tailored, fitted for one particular wearers foot.

untamable thicket across his head, dwindling into fine, downy 
curls upon his neck and back. His eyes are huge and dark and his 
lips have a distinct upward curl at the corners of his mouth. 
Two irregular, purplish spots, each the size of a thumbprint, 
appear on the smooth brown skin of the child's back.

sheen, shows nothing in the way of imperfections and errors; 
clearly crafted by someone who is a master at their craft. Made 
of fine, reinforced steel, it covers the torso, shoulders and 
hips and provides an outstanding amount of protection. While it 
appears at a glance to be quite heavy, the appearance is 
deceptive - it is reasonably light, perhaps little heavier than a 
chain hauberk. A pair of pauldrons protect the shoulders. The 
right pauldron bears a white sun rising amidst a sky blue field, 
half a dozen rays from the sun crossing the blue field.

body. The material is silken in nature, soft and light yet 
strangely warm for its weight. It is difficult to say what 
colour the cloak is: grey with the hue of twilight, yet in 
another light it seems green as shadowed leaves or brown as 
fallow fields by night. A deep, lined hood of the same silken 
material falls back from the shoulders and, when raised, the 
cloak veils the wearer entirely. A broad mallorn leaf showing 
its summer colours forms the clasp; bright silver below with a 
coating of pale green enamel atop, the artistry of the leaf so 
precise that it would be difficult to tell the clasp from a 
living leaf. This clasp pins the cloak upon the right breast, 
fixing the garment securely together.

bloody and brutal death.

An unadorned, simple-looking longsword lies here.~
   Relatively simple in design and without much adornment, this 
longsword looks to be of cheap and simple make upon first glance. 
If one where to study its design closely, however, they would 
realize they where quite wrong. The blade is the work of a 
master and sharpened to a razor sharp edge, coupled with a fine 
point at the tip and is excellently weighted. The hilt is 
wrapped in a single long strip of black leather and capping the 
sword at the end, a round dulled steel pommel caps the end. The 
crossguard provides excellent protection for wielders hand and at 
either end of it are set glass-like oval stones. The longsword 
would clearly be a deadly weapon in the hands of a skilled user.

A horrid, jumbled mass, coated in dried slime and fungus sags here against the wall.~
   Neither eyes nor minds lend themselves readily to the task of 
discerning how this loathsome, dead mass is composed. Here there 
lies the remains of what appears to have been a bat, but one side 
of its body has been stretched out of all proportion into a 
hideous shape. Atop it sprawls the dried carcass of what may 
have been a large rat, save that all its bones appear to have 
been worn outside its flesh. Other dead creatures spill down the 
wall to join the tangled mass: huge ants and spiders, serpents 
and strangely-spiked fungi, eyeless razor toothed beasts and 
still other things without names. The bulk of this charnel 
display is shot through with needle-thin spines of dark crystal, 
here piercing a desiccated eye, there pinning a twisted wing to 
the dried cap of a malignant-looking mushroom. There is no rhyme 
or reason apparent to their presence, and indeed a closer look 
verifies that some of the tiny slivers of dark stone seem to have 
extruded from under the very flesh of these dead creatures.

bracer PC_UNIQUE embroidered grey courbouilli tube leather LEATHER~
an embroidered, grey courbouilli bracer~
A long tube of grey-dyed leather embroidered with the image of a bird lies here.~
   Made of exacting measurements this piece of leather armor has 
been tailored for a specific person. Created in the style of 
courboulli this bracer has been moulded and sewn up into an 
archer's guard. Along the side intended for wear on the inner 
forearm, the leather has been ridged laterally along the length 
of armor, rather than ribbed. The careful waxing allows the 
bowstring to slip easily along, without scarring or harming an 
archer's arm. Bronze buckles have been attached to the straps of 
the leather, allowing the bracer to be tightened or loosened with 
relative ease. An even, solid coat of grey dye has been applied 
to the entire bracer and has been allowed to dry completely. 
Carefully embroidered upon the outer forearm with its wings 
spread out is the form of a hawk. Fine bone-white thread has 
been used to create this image, sparing no detail. Ghostly 
outlines of feathers and talons have been sewn into the leather. 
True to standard, the entire piece of armor has been dipped in 
wax before hardening.

crossguard is angled upward, the metal formed in the shape of a 
thorned vine. The pommel is made of steel, crosshatched with 
diagonal etchings to aid in gripping. The round pommel 
counterweights the blade, and in the end is set an emerald, 
cracked down the middle and looking as if it could fall out at 
any moment, despite the firm setting.

chair as well. Light-weight, medium-colored wood framing have 
been used for both the seat and the backs of the chairs, though 
only seen if one looks from the back or the base. Completing 
these seats are the cushions made of a soft, supple snow white 
velvet which are tacked to the seat and the back of each chair. 
Chair arms of brass have been welded to the brass of the frame.

a large banner bearing a sword-and-star and a birch tree~
A large, leaf-green banner bearing a sword-and-star and a birch tree flies here.~
   This large banner is composed of a heavy linen fabric dyed 
evenly in leaf-green throughout, held up on its long end by a 
wooden crossbar and tapering down to a point. Appliqued in white 
fabric near the top of the banner is a white emblem of a 
seven-pointed star arranged around the hilt of a sword that 
points down towards the taper with its tip. Below the sword is 
another piece of white fabric, detailing the outline of a birch 
tree. A thick oaken shaft runs down the back of this banner, 
joining to the crossbar and coming to a point some distance 
below. Dark leather cording is wrapped around the shaft 
approximately midway down the banner, large enough for two hands.

A teardropped, oval-shaped keyring, painted a bold emerald shade has been left here.~
   This elliptical keyring is made of a slim, rounded bar of 
willow. There is a gap of almost two inches in the oval shape. 
On each end of the gap is a globular teardrop shaped piece of 
matching wood, their bulbous ends connecting to the keyring, 
while the two points of the shapes face each other, close enough 
to almost touch. Each of the teardrops attaches to the keyring 
by way of a small, metal screw that twists into a tiny hole, 
capable of being removed in order to add or remove keys. The 
entire thing has been painted in a brilliant emerald green, along 
the edge is the Numenian-Tengwar letter 'calma', or 'K', written 
neatly in black, and the whole thing has been varnished to avoid 
being chipped.

a severed warg head~
A severed warg head lies here.~
   This is the gruesome severed head of a large adolescent warg. 
Its eyes stare blankly ahead, tongue lolled out to the side. The 
head has been severed about midway up the neck with fresh blood 
still dripping from the visible arteries and veins. Bloody, 
matted and stinking fur covers the entire skull.

out from above the snout of this once fearsome creature.

The statue of a tall, grim faced man stands on a pedestal at the end of the path.~
   Standing on a small, oval pedestal at the end of the path is 
the life-size statue of a man. The statue is exquisitely carved 
from dark-grey stone and depicts a man clad in a breastplate, the 
heraldry of the Great Lord Astirian carved across the front of 
the armor with great detail. Elsewhere he is clad in chain mail 
and a flowing, hooded cloak hanging from his shoulders . Tucked 
under his left arm he holds a barbute helm, the t-shaped visor 
widened slightly and a nose guard has been added in the shape of 
a sword, the blade pointing down towards where the mouth would be 
when worn. His hair is long, reaching to about shoulder height, 
and frames a face with a grim expression, as he frowns down upon 
the onlooker from his perch upon the pedestal. His right arm is 
outstretched and open, as if holding his hand out to help someone 
from the ground. Below the statue, a large plaque has been 
carved from stone.

remains only as rotting corpse. Flies and maggots mar its flesh, 
which now remains only in patches with yellowed bone reaching 
through it. The smell from this dark creature is immense and 
fills the room and those around it.

Its rusted armor has little use and is brittle and rusted to 
uselessness, upon his chestplate the faint etching of the White 
Tree can be roughly made out.

contentedly perched inside a beautiful golden cage. The bars of 
the cage are delicately filigreed with scrolls and curls as is

An empty gold filigree birdcage stands here.~
   The bars of this cage are delicately filigreed with scrolls 
and curls as is the little gold latch to the door. Inside, a 
small perch, a small bowl of water and some seeds and seed 
casings have been scattered upon the straw evidencing that not 
too long ago, this cage was inhabited. Currently, however, the 
door stands wide open awaiting its resident.

   This nightingale is a clever little bird with a puffed 
cream-colored chest. His head and back are a plain brown color 
which turns rusty in hue towards his tail. His little talons and 
beak are a paler brown, closer to tan and his eyes are a bright 
and intelligent black, the tiny soft feathers ringing each eye a 
touch paler than the rest of his head.

A tall elegant tree of slender beam grows here.~
   This tree's trunk splits near its base, rising high over head 
with sweeping bows sheathed in smooth white bark. The pale 
boughs split into branches of ever increasing slender delicacy 
until they all but disappear. The tree's leaves, white as the 
branches, rustle on every breeze, issuing forth an almost 
constant rustling that borders on the hearer's awareness as a 
murmuring song.

A small, scraggly plant with sharp thorns sprouts from the ground here.~
   This malevolent growth sprouts here, its woody trunk as thick 
as a man's thumb and covered with a maze of prickly, sharp 
thorns. Its branches reach out in haphazard manner close to the 
ground and sport small, blood-red buds, tightly rolled and 
protected by ebon thorns that warn any from trying to pluck them. 
Anyone who tries to pull this plant from the ground would be 
dealt a nasty scratch or stab from the thorns.

A collection of low-hanging and dangling greenery and twigs has been gathered and arranged here, leaves moving in the slightest amount of wind.~
   Numerous branches and twigs have been arranged here into a 
low-hanging dangling mass of greenery. From the various 
collected plants, a fragrant odor rises, earthy and clean. It 
seems to be a collection pleasant for any small wildlife or 
insects, although for any larger creatures, it could well present 
a tripping hazard.

   The whole helm is expertly crafted from fine steel in the 
shape of a hound's head. The visor as a whole attaches to the 
rest of the helm with a thick leather strap and metal buckles. 
It is forged to represent a snarling hound: the elongated muzzle 
shows a set of sharp, bared steel fangs. The oval eye slit for 
the wearer is located where the eyes of the hound would be. Two 
triangular-shaped metal ears are attached on either side on top 
of the helm. Covering the entirety of the head of the wearer and 
with padding inside, this helm provides complete protection.
