Ondoher Artamir Faramir statues large three _ARMENELOS_ _UNIQUE_ STONE~
three great statues~
Three great statues are set here, towering over those walking by.~
   These three statues of white marble are works of the same 
artisan, and set together on a giant base of similar stone. 
Larger than life size, they command attention from those who pass 
by underneath. The tallest of the three, in front, carries a 
winged crown in the crook of his left arm, and wields a sword in 
his right hand held aloft. He is gird in mail, and on a fine 
cuirass is carved a beautiful white tree and stars. 
   
   The two behind are smaller figures, yet still dwarf a normal 
human's size. The taller is graced with a circlet on his 
forehead and wears similar detailed raiment. The third is 
dressed as a common soldier, yet his features match the other two 
in grace, bearing, and lineage.

A stained glass window casts soft light into the room.~
   Soft light spills through the stained glass of this window, a 
series of sixteen glass tiles set in a square pattern, morticed 
with gold. The image crosses the tiles as a stylized set of blue 
irises, intertwined with long leaves. Stunning in its elegant 
simplicity, it uplifts the entire room with its grace.

an ancient tapestry~
An ancient tapestry hangs high upon the wall.~
   This faded tapestry is of a woman in a white gown, sitting at 
a stone bench within a gazebo. The gazebo overlooks a cliff side 
and an ocean view. The sea is calm, and it is a cloudless day. 
The woman has her left hand outstretched, and a white gull is 
alighting upon it. 
   The artistry of the piece is masterful, even though it is now 
worn by time.

   Upon a marble pedestal lays a carved silver bowl of leaf 
patterns. The artisan carved their design from the bowl, leaving 
gaps between the leaves of silver that make up the piece. The 
metalwork is otherwise plain and unadorned. Light gleams from 
the bare polished silver.

row statues lamps figures _ARMENELOS_ _UNIQUE_ METAL~
a row of statues holding lamps~
A row of statues holding lamps are set into the ground at intervals.~
   This row of lamps are hung from metal statues of soldiers of 
Gondor. Each soldier holds a spear aloft, and to each spear is 
affixed a brass bracket which holds an oil filled glass globe. 
The soldiers are all alike, but each bracket is of a unique 
design. One is an image of flying eagles, another of hunting 
foxes, another still of leaping fish. They seem to represent 
fauna and flora from all corners of the Realm of Gondor. All 
hold the glass firmly, and when lit cast shadows of their animals 
all about in a bewildering array of light and dark.

A statuette of a Knight of Gondor is here.~
   Standing just over a foot tall, this marble statuette of a 
knight upon a horse is finely detailed. From the white tree on 
the escutcheon to the overlapped plates on the crinet, the horse 
is accurately rendered. The knight holds a heavy spear in hand, 
and bears a sword in a scabbard which is also graced by the white 
tree emblem.

table BY_VAIRE ancient crumbling decaying STONE~
an ancient decaying, crumbling table~
An ancient decaying, crumbling table lies in ruins.~
Faded sigils scratched and worn beyond recognition by smudging, cracks
can be seen in a few locations on this rough dilapidated wreck of a
table. Upon it's top, the three quarters of it which has survived are
darkly stained with worn blood and fresher slime. Insects skitter
across it's length, quickly disappearing between the cracks which riddle
the entire length of the table. Off-center is a claw-like piece of iron
twisted and embedded deeply into the stone with bits of dull glass
fragments nearby suggesting it may have previously been a lantern
that had gotten crushed into the stone. Between these clawlike pieces
of iron is trapped the long-dead corpse of a rat, the meat having
been scavenged long ago as mangy pieces of fur cling to the skeleton
of the rodent, and an inedible mould which gives off a distinctly
unpleasant aroma, nestling itself between the crevices from which
the insects scurry to and fro. Four roughly hewn stone blocks spaced
unevenly about the table provide seats.

An old, rotten warg-pelt couch sags near the wall.~
   The rancid smell of rotten hide permeates the area surrounding 
this dilapidated piece of furniture. Moldy stuffing of stained 
scraps of fabric is exposed in the many places that the warg pelt 
cover has been torn or decayed, and its entire structure seems to 
sag with age and wear. The arm on the right side appears to have 
been broken off at some point, leaving mysteriously stained 
jagged shanks of wood protruding forth from beneath the ragged, 
stinking hide.

A white-marbled fountain emitting the sound of bells is set here.~
   A wide pool is contained with a high white-marbled walled 
basin, much of the glory of container faded and worn now. Within 
the pool a sweeping spiral has been carved out of a single block 
of black and silver speckled marble. A single boldly steep 
channel twists about what becomes a wide base and narrow top, 
with a large silvered glass bowl set at the very tip. The force 
of the water that is channelled here sends a great plume of heavy 
spray upwards, captured as it falls and then dropping through a 
hole in the glass bowl to flood down the spiral channel into the 
pool. As the water descends, a series of glass bells of 
ascending tone spin and ring with clear and fresh notes, gaily 
emitting their song amidst the awful gloom of this place.

A bronze statue of an archer has been placed carefully along the wall.~
   Made of gilded copper, this figurine is of a crouched man 
holding a bow, about to release a yard shafted arrow. Naked, his 
rippled musculature is in sharp relief. Intent upon the distant 
target, his brow is furrowed over an aquiline nose as he sights 
past the tip of the broadhead just beyond his left hand, wrapped 
around the golden shortbow. The copper is very green underneath 
the gold.

rug carpet panorama Numenor Andunie _UNIQUE_ _ARMENELOS_ TEXTILE~
a great rug~
A great rug is set upon the floor here.~
   This rug has grown in beauty as it aged, and is now of a 
sufficiently significant antiquity to exude beauty, elegance, and 
quality in equal measure. Imaginative and artistic coloring has 
combined with the most careful fabric work to produce an image 
that is vast and breathtaking. 
   Anor the sun is unseen, yet the interplay of his soft glow 
with the long shadows cast about upon the image are the epitome 
of perfect gloaming, as twilight falls upon a shoreline. In the 
foreground, a city is nestled within a bay set between two arms 
of land that both curve the same direction. There are towers in 
the city that look out, upon the water. A great bird flies high 
above the tallest tower. In the background, the land rises to a 
set of mountains, with one single, very tall peak among them. In 
the far distance, the Sea completely encircles the land.

   The eye is drawn to the nape of the neck of this white marble 
bust, which is positioned in the room to highlight the feature. 
Her head is turned away, a hint of a gown over a single shoulder, 
and her hair elegantly coiled atop her head. A soft cheek can be 
seen, as well as one ear. The artist has captured a moment of 
beauty and courtliness for all time.

links have a red and crimson shine to them, some of the blood 
dried and crusted, some freshly spilled.

roadway. A gurgling of water swirls near the bottom at one end, 
where a small pipe can be seen poking in, gently refilling the 
water.

A series of huge piles of rubble, broken glass, remnants of old buildings, and discarded items is here.~
   Comprising broken aged glass, twisted iron poles pitted with 
rust, great blocks of stone still clutching decayed mortar, the 
odd rusted item left behind, this is a place for scavengers to 
crawl among the wreckage that once stood proud and new to the 
east within the garrison. Streams of grime run out of the huge 
mounds during heavy rain and pour into the long trough besides 
the wide roadway of packed dirt and wide lanterns hanging from 
newly-sunk poles. Rats and stray dogs slink about, tearing at 
discarded wreckage and, some say, the murdered and disappeared 
hidden amongst the past here. You can #Bscavenge#0 here.

An old, rotten warg-pelt couch sits broken near the wall.~
   The rancid smell of rotten hide permeates the area surrounding 
this dilapidated piece of furniture. Moldy stuffing of stained 
scraps of fabric is exposed in the many places that the warg pelt 
cover has been torn or decayed, and its entire structure seems to 
sag with age and wear. The arm on the right side appears to have 
been broken off at some point, leaving mysteriously stained 
jagged shanks of wood protruding forth from beneath the ragged, 
stinking hide.

A series of wagons rumble back and forth here.~
   The Egthela transport system is hardly sophisticaed. Old 
wagons, no doubt stolen from Ithilien's abandoned farmsteads, 
ride the stony paths and avenues back and forth all day and 
night. A covered seat houses the scowling blackblood 
wagonmasters who are paid for their services by the Priest-Lord. 
Back and forth, on and on, occasionally crashing off the ramps 
and killing everyone inside, but normally quite safe.

a human-masked helm of blackened iron~
A human-masked helm of blackened iron lies here.~
   This helm has been forged to take the unique shape of its 
wearer's head, and its protection encompases the entire head and 
face, as well as part of the neck. Its back piece, beginning at 
the crown of the head, is smooth and rounded, bearing a loop for 
a chain at the base of its neck. Another piece extends down over 
the brow in an exaggerated widow's peak, with barbed iron rivets 
along its edge. From there is a mask in the shape of a stylized 
human face, with narrowed slits for eyes, a prominent, pointed 
nose, and high cheekbones. A hinged bucket-jaw rests below that, 
its rivets larger versions of the barbs across the brow. It 
appears that the front half of this helm can be unfastened and 
slid back to allow for easy removal.

a hooded greatcoat of patchwork leather~
A patchwork-leather greatcoat lies crumpled here.~
   Sewn of many different heavy patches of supple leather, this 
greatcoat is by far from masterfully made, though it seems to be 
able to serve its purpose of keeping the wearer dry and warm very 
well regardless. The coat seems to be designed with armour in 
mind. Two large arms allow the coat to be used over all but the 
thickest of armour types and a large, heavy hood covers the 
wearers head when needed. The coat reaches down easily to 
ankles, even on the frame of a taller person. The coat has 
clearly been soaked in oil many times, providing good water 
proofing, water droplets simply sliding from it when contact is 
made. Several small pockets and two larger ones are present on 
the inside. It is lined in thick, shaggy fur.

A talon-marked iron full-helm lies here.~
   This iron full-helm is, at its basic design, a sturdy cylinder 
which angles inwards at the eye-slits. Made mostly of 
well-polished iron, a raised talon spreads down across the face, 
with the middle directly over the nose and the others to the 
sides of the eyes; these have been blackened, as have the 
reinforced bands about the eyes and top of the helm, save for a 
strip around the talons, which remains uncoloured. The helm 
almost fully conceals the wearer's face, obscuring all but a 
small portion of the wearer's eyes.

   This piece consists of a breastplate and back-plate of iron, 
each hammered smooth and fitted to the intended wearer; fastening 
them together are tooled straps of black leather, and iron 
buckles of a matching colour. Each shoulder bears a pauldron of 
gleaming, blackened iron, and, upon the polished iron 
breastplate, over the wearer's solar plexus, is the image of the 
clawed foot of some great bird of prey, the talons reaching about 
the rib-cage and seeming to pierce the sides.

around the top, further chain has been designed to fasten to the

talons fastened to the ankle which descend over the front of the 
wearer's boots.

leaving dark stained tracks which flow away from the eye and

bodice etched smoky grey hard fitted pKANDIDIA LEATHER~
an etched, smoky-grey hard leather fitted bodice~
A smoky-grey hard leather bodice has been left here, its surface bearing etchings in the leather.~
   Laced at the sides with sapphire cord, this bodice is made out 
of panels of hardened smoky grey hued leather that have been 
shaped and structured to the female form in an hourglass shape. 
Each of the panels is tightly sewn to its neighbours with thick 
thread that matches the hue of the lacing cords. The front panel 
is larger and flat, designed to flatter, with an etched design of 
a crescent moon at chest height. Wide leather is used as straps 
over the shoulders to ensure the armour is more secure, each of 
these containing small, round holes to lace sleeves onto the 
garment. Buckles are placed on these straps as they pass the 
collarbone and back of the neck to attach a collar. At the end 
of the lacing cords are strung small, carved bone beads and they 
are topped with sapphire and bronze-hued feathers the size of a 
woman's little finger, the decorations left to dangle over the 
hips. The edges of the leather are sewn with deep sapphire silk 
to increase comfort during wearing as well as add a splash of 
luxury.

A pair of smoky-grey and sapphire-blue sleeves of snakeskin leather have been left here on the ground.~
   Supple diamonds of dyed leather have been sewn together in a 
snakeskin pattern for these sleeves. The majority of the pieces 
are smoky grey, however a handful of sapphire blue have been 
scattered in amid the darker pieces. The sleeves are laced at 
the cuffs, binding them to the wrists, and have silver-capped 
blue cord points to attach them to body armour.

   This collar is made up of smoky grey leather plates sewn 
tightly together with thick sapphire hued thread. It covers the

and behind the neck with broad leather straps to secure it to 
body armour. Sapphire blue silk has been sewn to the edges of 
the leather for comfort and aesthetics.

A pair of smoky-grey leather leggings with black plating have been left on the ground here.~
   Well-fashioned, these leggings are of an exotic look, being 
similar to brigandine. While bearing a series of sooty black 
round steel plates set atop each thigh, knee and shin, this pair 
of leggings is composed of tightly moulded, pliable smoky grey 
leather that clasps and reveals the wearer's form. Blue cord 
laces the leggings up, each ending in ornate silver points.

a sapphire-blue butterfly emblazoned leather helm~
A sapphire-blue leather helm, emblazoned with butterflies, has been left here.~
   Made of moulded hard leather, dyed sapphire-blue and painted 
realistically, the front of this helm resembles a butterfly with 
spread wings, its body forming the nose-guard. Two elliptical 
slits grace the upper wings of the butterfly, stylised to 
resemble exotically shaped eyes through which the wearer's own 
eyes can be seen. The butterfly plate slides vertically, being 
able to be pinned upon the top of the head for a greater field of 
vision, or to cover the face for greater protection. The rest of 
the head is encircled with snug-fitting, smoky grey hardened 
leather lined with thick sapphire-blue silk.

a long, rusty poleaxe bearing a spear marked, blood-red banner~
A long, rusty poleaxe stands here, attached to the top is a blood-red banner, clustered diagonally with five black spears.~
   This long, wooden pole has a large, blood-red banner attached 
at the top, as well as a somewhat rusted, pointed iron axe-head 
on it's tip which has been roughly sharpened. The grisly banner 
consists of a blood-red field, on which five black spears have 
been clustered diagonally. The stitching is haphazard and 
shoddy, yet the insignia is still clearly depicted. The banner 
and axe-head are attached to a thick, red paint-flaked wooden 
pole that can stand upright on it's own, and allows the grisly 
banner to flap in the wind whether being carried or on display.

different than most others. The thing that sets it apart is the 
engraving of a scale with an entwined snake, flanked by a fox and 
a mongoose that has been delicately carved in to the steel 
surface. Other than that, this key is fairly unremarkable.

an ornately-runed, embellished, steel-bladed dagger~
An ornate, steel-bladed dagger embellished with a blood-filled glass encapsule lies here, discarded.~
   A blade of fine steel is one of the main ingredients of this 
dagger, although the shape of it is something rather odd. 
Imitating a serpent, the blade is thin, twisting, with slight 
indentations along the length. Giving off a fine sheen in even 
dim light, the blade is truly a piece of fine workmanship. The 
only other oddity about the weapon would be the hilt; made of a 
pure white material, resembling ivory, it is long and smooth, 
with only an occasional fleck of a dull grey. Embellished within 
the center of the hilt is a small, encapsulated vessel, filled 
with what appears to be an ichorous, blackish-red substance. 
Dark, ornate runes encompass the entirety of the ceremonial 
weapon, etched deep and with vivid precision in an ominously 
Morgulite style.

A series of gruesomely adorned iron chains lies here in a pile.~
   Hewn of dark iron purposefully smoked longer than necessary to 
take out any remaining shine the metal might have held. Crafted 
of one continual snaking of links, these dark iron bindings are 
adorned with independently with blunt weights and hooks spanning 
in size from fish-hooks to slaughter-house meat-hooks, some even 
still hooked into the wearers mutilated flesh. At once perhaps 
used to restrain, now the ends would be worn about the shoulders, 
and dangle shattered as trophies to clatter with the movements of 
the wearer. Scattered about in chinks of the iron, are severed 
digits of several races, flaccid tongues, perhaps strings of 
teeth or top-knots scalped from owners.

   Chain links forged of thick, dark iron form a heavy noose and 
short leash that ends in a broken link. The loop is wide enough 
to pass over the head of a tremendous beast, and the blackened 
metal is covered with a layer of grimy filth. The leash is only 
a few feet long, the broken link suggesting that it had meant to 
be longer.

   A crude pair of horns has been attached to the temples of this 
giant-sized helm, which is made of thick panels of leather set 
with blackened scales. They drape down the back of the neck, and 
a nosepiece is set in front, a slender taper of metal that offers 
some slight protection to the face. The scales are set closely 
together, bristling outward as they cover the helm, and a great 
number are used to fashion the monstrously large helmet.

overall, and was once a white colour but now has been stained in 
places with sweat, blood, and muck.

a pattern of lines across the tunic, particularly along the seam 
lines. The shoulders feature cap sleeves, short ones with a 
slightly-rolled brim, and the neckline is v-shaped with a 
contrasting edging that is also diamond punched. It is enough to 
protect blows from practice weapons, but those of real ones would 
do the wearer extreme damage. A small patch bearing a caged 
helmet has been sewn over the right breast.

and helping to deflect blows that land there. The arm uncovered
by the armguard is afforded some basic protection with some

of many a savage blow. Some leather strappings offer meager 
protection to the left uncovered by the greave.

strapping affords the arm unprotected by the armguard some
basic coverage.

and buckles, rather than laces. The leather has been boiled in 
wax and left to harden. The gorget has been dyed $finecolor, and 
a wavy border has been embossed along the bottom collar.

A brass-rimmed, wooden spyglass rests here.~
   A little over a foot in length, this spyglass is made of 
darkly-stained wood. Tapering from one end to the other, the 
larger end is perhaps twice the width of the narrower one, itself
about an inch in diameter. Both ends are rimmed with brass into 
which have been set recessed lenses. A shoulder strap is 
attached to the spyglass, allowing it to be worn when not in use.

a delicate ring crowned in a silver rose and garnet teardrop~
A delicate ring crowned in a silver rose and garnet teardrop has been left upon the ground here.~
   This ring is a thin, delicate band formed of silver hammered 
to a smooth, mirror-like finish. Silver, cut and finely-molded 
into a coil, has been discreetly soldered to the band in the 
likeness of a blooming desert rose. Within the unfurling cradle 
of the flower rests a gleaming garnet teardrop held tightly in a 
deceptively fragile setting.
