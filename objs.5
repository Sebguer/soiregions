a crude scimitar~
An ill-fashioned curved blade lies here.~
   A heavy curved blade of dull iron has been affixed to a crude 
wooden handle. The indentations of hammer-strokes along the 
blade mark where the smith who fashioned it hurriedly and 
unskillfully beat the cooling iron. What it lacks in workmanship 
though it makes up for in weight.

A grimy, serrated dagger lies here, its blade blackened.~
   This dagger isn't much more than a jagged piece of metal 
mounted upon a small handle.  The blade is blackened with some 
sort of odd finish, and the whole thing is caked with grime.  It 
smells of old blood and damp metal.

   A rough wooden shield, slightly longer in diameter than a

   A frayed, tattered and otherwise worn leather vest, which has 
been roughly patched a great number of times, so it almost seems 
more patch than vest. A light brown originally, it has been 
patched with brown, grey, black and even red-dyed leather 
patches. The patches are of various thicknesses, making the vest 
flex unevenly and awkwardly.

construction of this spear, being clearly evident in its crude 
form. Despite its obvious imperfections, it is still usable as a

   Evidently stitched quickly and somewhat poorly, the rough and 
unpolished leather of this set of mid-calf boots is dulled to the 
point that small cracks have broken through along the form of the 
ankle area. Seeming too dry, yet overly oily, the leather is 
unadorned and practical, obviously worn for no other purpose than 
protection. The soles are thick and heavy, giving them a certain 
weight that allows for a threatening appearance and a far from 
comfortable wear.

an iron, metal-working hammer~
An iron, metal-working hammer has been discarded here.~
   The head of this smith's hammer has been forged from iron, and 
carefully sanded into a smooth cylindrical shape. The handle is 
built out of heavy ironwood, giving the hammer strength, while 
protecting the wielder from the heat of the head. Part of the 
hammer has turned black from exposure to the soot in the fires.

A hiltless swordblade lies here.~
   Newly cast, this blade is little more than a long piece of 
blackish cast-iron in the shape of a sword blade. It has not yet 
been strengthened by a smith's hammer, and is consequently still 
very fragile.

a rough, dull iron anvil~
A rough, dull iron anvil stands here.~
   Standing roughly at knee-height, this iron anvil has been cast 
large enough so that repetitive hammer-strikes do not budge it 
from its position. It is flat on the top, and there are several 
curved or otherwise different geometric surfaces on the sides 
that would allow the smith to forge any shape of his choosing. 
It is dullish gray in color, the glossiness having been faulted 
by multitudes of scratches.

a charred wooden shortbow~
A charred wooden shortbow has been left here on the ground~
   Built from the charred remains of some sort of wood, this 
shortbow does not look to have a long usable future ahead of it. 
The wood is very brittle and requires careful use so as not to be 
broken. The edges are not entirely even, making it a bit awkward 
to nock an arrow that would be pointing straight in the correct 
direction. The string of the bow seems to be made from some sort 
of dark-greenish hide.

   A thick-set blade of iron meets a solid bronze hilt styled in 
a simple curving pattern at the base of this sword. The blade is 
well made, though likely mass produced and bears few 
extraordinary features outside its surprisingly sharp, v-shaped 
tip. The hilt is wrapped in a single piece of red leather sewn 
behind small quillions for perfected grip.

A wicked, two-headed pole-arm has been discarded here, its iron blade dirtied.~
   This heavy weapon has been constructed of dull iron forged 
into a heavy five foot long pole and then wrapped in black 
leather. At the end of the pole is a pair of crescent shaped 
blades coming to a sharp point in the middle. Resembling a twin 
headed glaive slightly a pair of a tassels are tied to where the 
head meets the haft. This weapon could likely function as a 
spear or a pole-arm and still function in a lethal fashion in 
either capacity.

A large tattered tapestry hangs upon the wall here.~
   A large woolen article that once used to be a tapestry hangs 
upon the wall. While it used to cover most of this entire 
section of the wall, it appears that every so often, over the 
course of its multi-centennial life, someone walked by, and 
detached a piece from the bottom of the tapestry. Currently, the 
only parts remaining are those that are just above a taller man's 
arm-reach. Most of the colors have been faded, or eaten away by 
moths. From a distance, one can merely see the resemblance of a 
yellow sun in the upper right hand corner.

   Whilst of poor quality, this arrow is still easily capable of 
causing grevious damage when nocked into a bow and released into 
flight. Shorter than the typical arrow, the iron head that tops 
the blackwood shaft has been forged of crude iron, most likely 
due to a hasty smelting process.

   The iron of this blade has slowly began to rust away, flaking 
off ever so slightly. Though not as sharp as it once was, the 
blade remains firmly fixed to a heavy iron cross-guard designed 
to protect the hands. The hilt is made out of a careless leather 
wrap which is coming undone in some places, yet despite its lack 
of beauty and glorious design the blade is still and effective 
and dangerous two and a half feet of iron.

frame of a leather in a less then beauteous fashion creating a 
rough-edged, unyielding breastplate. The iron itself has been 
darkened slightly from the smoke and ash of the fire where it was 
forged. Heavy pauldrons extend from the shoulders, each bearing 
three massive, but slightly rusty spikes. The plates themselves 
are somewhat patchwork leaving occasional holes in the defense of 
the armor where rows of dark iron chains stretch across the chest 
to deflect blows.

to hide the wearer from the elements. Large holes in the coarse, 
black fur have been patched over where holes had been torn out of 
the cloak or the crafter was simply careless.

Crudely threaded through each is a dirty cord that has a small

of the claws, evidence of their violent removal.

rags is somewhat itchy the touch and is most uncomfortable. 
While this garment can barely be called a tunic, it is made out 
of greasy, torn linen and is cut at the edges to allow the arms 
to stick through. The stitching holding this tunic together is 
quite clumsy and careless as it is coming loose any many places 
leaving bits of string sticking out.

of $drabcolor linen that were likely at one time a cloak before

protection from lying on the ground itself and allow for small 
treasures to be stored away between them, evident from the bits 
of bone and other objects imbedded within.

$drabcolor linens it has long since seen its better days and 
various stains of food and worse have began to accumulate upon 
it. Far worse, however, is the occasional perception of a moving 
insect between its folds, only rearing their heads long enough to 
make their presence felt. While grotesque, this blanket does 
keep its user warm, a reminder that pleasantries can mean little 
if something can save one from freezing to death.

polished to a sharp sheen is attached to a thick pommel wrapped 
in leather. Deadly and precise, this blade could easily chop 
through bone and the force of its swings would be quite intense. 
Although this blade is totally unadorned and undecorated it takes 
away little from the effectiveness of this weapon.

   Stained nearly black with dried blood of unknown origin, these 
teeth and claws seem to have been torn from some large beast. 
Crudely threaded through each is a dirty cord that has a small 
iron hook at each end that serves to secure it to the wearer's 
neck. Bits of dried flesh are flattened to the tops of many of 
the claws, evidence of their violent removal. Hanging from the 
middle of the cord is a silver ring embedded with quartz, flanked 
on either side by the teeth and claws.

A blackened trapjaw helm lies here.~
Forged of thick blackened iron, this trapjaw helm consists of a
single deep iron cap combined with three crudely spiked iron jaws
overlapping each other, spanning from under the jaw to just below
the eyes, leaving a slit for visibility. The ugly jaws are held
in place by a single metal pin on either side of the helm, just
behind where the temple would be situated. Delved into either
side of the iron helmet are two rounded arcs, allowing its wearer's
ears to slightly protrude when worn. Adorning the top of the helmet
is a lone iron spike, which has been sharpened to a lethal point.
Although this helm is of a substantial weight, it offers ample
protection to the head.

A blood-red bladed battlesword with a skull hilt lies here with an unusual gleam.~
   The long, curving blade on this sword seems to have been 
etched with odd numenian runes. Clearly a weapon made for two 
hands, this blade would not be light to the touch and is clearly 
devilishly sharp. The pommel has been wrapped in darkened warg 
leather easily allowing enough room for two hands to clutch the 
sword. A large, skull shaped design has been implemented on the 
blade, yet it would appear to be the skull of an orc, not a 
human. The skull seems to have an odd and cruel grin about its 
face. The blade is an impossible hue of red, almost as if it had 
been soaked in blood that had turned to glass.

pike SUB_QUALITY iron warped-headed head METAL~
an iron, warped-headed pike~
An iron pike with a warped head lies here.~
   The metal long since blackened by rust and old blood, this 
pike's iron head is quite warped, corroded along the edges. 
Still, it has been sharpened to a serviceable point and can 
probably do much damage if wielded in the right hands. Its long, 
wooden shaft is slightly bent in several spots, and smeared with 
a layer of black pitch.

A rectangular shield of hard, boiled leather lies here.~
   About the height of a goblin, and two thirds of that in width, 
this shield bears a roughly rectangular shape. It is made of 
tough, boiled leather and is quite lumpy in places, while 
slightly cracked in others. A thick, iron grip is riveted to the 
back, while a pair of leather straps allow it to be slung across 
one's back.

A pair of small drums, stretched with human leather, rests here.~
   The heads of these drums appear to be made of human skin, put 
through the tanning process and turned into a yellowish leather. 
The drums themselves are fairly small, painted black and 
blood-red in angular patterns around the curved sides. They are 
held together by a short rod of wood, while a cord running 
through allows them to be slung around the neck.

a mithril-edged, obsidian-rimmed broadsword~
A mithril-edged, obsidian-rimmed broadsword lies glinting upon the floor.~
   This large broadsword has been crafted in a conserving fashion 
from mithril. The mithril makes up the frame and the edges while 
the middle of the broadsword has been filled with polished 
obsidian. The dark stone upon the shining metal cuts an odd 
contrast, but not half as odd as the series of runes inscribes 
upon the obsidian in some form of green ink. The edges of the 
blade are straight, at all places except the hilt and the tip of 
blade where it tapers into a sharp point.

A jeweled sword-scabbard made from blackened iron lies here.~
   This sword scabbard is fit for a rich man, and is almost 
becoming of a King. A series of rubies have been encrusted upon 
the hilt in the oddly black iron every so often. It appears 
almost as if the scabbard was weeping tears of blood upon the 
length of blade. Woven bronze vines trickle down a short way on 
the scabbard before coming to a rather abrupt stop at the first 
and largest of the rubies.

a fearsome, skull-headed battering ram~
A fearsome, skull-headed battering ram lies here.~
   This large siege implement looks fearsome indeed, being big 
enough for three or four men to hold at once. A straight, round 
log has been capped with black iron at both ends, shiny bronze 
rivets holding the metal in place. Facing downward on the front 
end glares a jawless human skull, covered with bronze and 
sporting two thick, ridged horns that curl to form the 
bludgeoning end of the ram. Jutting from the rear end is a 
squat, sharp iron spike fastened to a metal plate to prevent the 
wood from splitting. At regular intervals along the length of 
the log, four broad rope handles have been sturdily tied, 
allowing it to be gripped by as many wielders. Between them has 
been carved a war-scene into the wood, in which a group of humans 
are being crushed, maimed, and slaughtered by a host of malefic 
creatures, including orcs, goblins, and a mighty troll. Etched 
onto the forehead of the skull is a lidless eye, speaking of 
whence this creation came.

   Heavy and anything but pretty, this cloak is fashioned from 
numerous wolf pelts sewn together crudely. The grey fur lining 
it is dirtied in areas, lined with fleas and grime. Sufficiently 
warm enough to protect its wearer against the elements, this 
cloak is not so stifling as to overheat someone were they to 
stand beneath the sun. Stitched into the material on the back is 
a skull.

has long sleeves and a thigh-length lower hem. Its neckline, like 
all its edges, is slightly tattered. The garment has a few stains

It is meant to go around a wearer's head, completely covering up 
one of their eyes.

   The thick, brown leather of these boots has been roughly cut, 
but the stitches are very sturdy, if tastelessly made. They rise 
to just below the knee, secured by means of tugging several 
leather straps through their accompanying bone buckle, the latter 
of which is blackened thoroughly. Despite their rather shoddy 
workmanship, they look very sturdy and protective.

leather has been shaped to fit over a four-legged creature's

fastened to the mount, and though the leather is patched, it 
looks as if it would provide decent protection to most of a 
creature's vital areas.

many splotches and stains, as if it was tanned badly or has 
simply been mis-used by former owners. It is roughly square in

   Once this vest may have been a fine example of leatherworking. 
Now, time and possibly another owner or ten, have torn holes into 
the strong material. The left shoulder strap has been patched 
with an oily piece ragged burlap that also wraps around the 
midsection and right lower side. A single bronze ring is left 
attached on the bottom piece of hide, dented into a shape more 
like an oval then a circlet. It does not fasten shut, making it 
a most indecent piece of armor for a female.

this sheath is a horrible display of craftsmanship, and an 
excellent display of functionality. Basically a long strip of 
hardened leather, it is worked to loop around the waist in a 
sling, and has another, smaller, adjustable loop for whatever the 
wearer decides to sheath. This design leaves most weapons 
exposed to the cruelties of weather and daily wear and tear.

shards and pieces of metal, punched with holes and then threaded 
with tough pieces of sinew to hold them into some roughly 
shirt-like form. As armor, it would offer some protection from 
light blows, although the pieces of sharp metal would cut back 
into the skin. However, it is well-ventilated and relatively 
light weight - ideal for wearing in the heat.

The handle of this knife has been crafted into an hour glass

is the handle which, curiously enough, has been carved from a set 
of deer antlers.

blade itself is of good craftsmanship, sharpened on both sides, 
it's tip rounded, marking this as a slashing weapon, as opposed 
to a thrusting one. The hilt is wrapped in thick leather straps 
and the bronze crossguard is thick and heavy. A large bronze 
triangular pommel is the last piece of this sword, balancing it 
out nicely.

pool jagged rocky murky water STONE~
a large, uneven pool~
A jagged pool has been dug out of the rocky ground, full of murky water.~
   The depth of this large, obviously hand-dug pool is difficult 
to discern, as the water that fills it is murky with scum and 
debris, though it looks plenty deep enough for a goblin to drown 
in if they aren't careful. It's approximately six feet in 
diameter, fed by a trickling stream that crosses the pathway, 
oozing into and out of the pool as it meanders along.

a roped-off fighting pit~
A huge, roped-off fighting pit is dug out of the cavern floor.~
   Dug directly out of the hardpacked earth, this crude pit is 
spacious enough for even two trolls to brawl if one truly wished 
to risk viewing such a brutal spectacle. Heavy rope is tied to 
poles that are set at even intervals around the pit, providing 
little in the way of actual resistance, but serving as a general 
reminder to keep back from the edges. A steep drop-off of 
several feet forms a wall when within the pit, uneven steps cut 
out of the hard dirt that lead down into it from two sides. The 
sand-strewn floor is littered with gruesome reminders of past 
fights, and is gouged and stained with many unidentifiable 
liquids, though blood is most certainly one of them.

An engraved, two-headed pole-arm has been discarded here, its steel blade gleaming.~
   This great weapon has been constructed of burnished steel 
forged into a five foot long pole and then wrapped in black 
leather. At the end of the pole is a pair of crescent shaped 
blades coming to a sharp point in the middle. Resembling a twin 
headed glaive slightly, a pair of a tassels are tied to where the 
head meets the haft. This weapon could likely function as a 
spear or a pole-arm and in a lethal fashion in either capacity. 
Artfully engraved into the surface of each blade is the likeness 
of a crow's wing, designed to follow the blade's wicked curve.

A black flail lies here, a clump of matted hair shooting from its handle.~
   Although simple and unadorned the craftsmanship behind this 
implement of war is clearly superb, in competant hands truly a 
dangerous weapon. Its handle is just over a foot and half long, 
which save for several inches on each end has been ribbed and 
wrapped in warg leather for a sure grip. Each end bears a 
half-link of thick chain, the bottom holding a long tassel of 
grey and brown warg hair while the top connects to a two foot 
long chain. This chain leads to a solid wide cylinder, nearly 
half the length and over twice the width of the handle. Three 
rows of thick triangular spikes encircle this cylinder, their 
edges and points finely honed to an incredible keenness.

blackened steel, its ends curving up and down in wickedly formed 
spikes. Its haft is of simple make, a thick piece of metal 
wrapped in leather for a strong grip. The pommel is set with a 
single warg tooth.

vest hide ragged stinking fur LEATHER~
a stinking, ragged hide vest~
A vest made of ragged furs lies in a stinking heap.~
   This filthy vest is disgusting enough that even a goblin might 
hesitate before wearing it. The furs weren't ever tanned, still 
stinking of blood, gore, and decay, and matted with more of the 
same. What they once belonged to is now unrecognizeable, and 
they're held together in a relatively shapeless mass by threads 
made of sinew. It has a ragged hole for the arms, head, and 
waist, and little more than that.

a pair of filthy hide footpads~
Strips of filthy hide lie discarded on the ground.~
   Badly cured and incredibly filthy, this footwear is little 
more than long strips of soft hides, meant to wrap around the 
foot and muffle sound. They provide some scant protection to the 
foot against the debris of the ground, though little else.

A belt made of mangy strips of rat hide lies here.~
   This is a thin belt made of patchy, mangy rat fur. It has no 
buckle, but is long enough to tie around the waist of most orcs, 
and twice around the waist of a goblin. Though stinking badly 
and poorly tanned, it's relatively strong.

   The hollow skull of a humanoid creature has been packed 
tightly with dirt, filling every hole and crevice. Wrapped 
around it is a layer of dried grass in order to both keep the 
dirt in and serve as padding. The result is a round, if 
misshapen, ball that moves in an erratic fashion when rolling 
along the ground.

A slender crossbow lies here, its stock a dark-hue.~
   A dark wood has been used in the construction of the 
smoothly-sanded stock of this crossbow. Set at the narrow end of 
the base and extending down to the middle is the flexible bow, a 
groove shaped from its end to the tip of its stock is designed to 
allow bolts to fly freely and fiercely. The mechanism for the 
draw of the bow connects to a dull bronze trigger, the the thick 
tendon string sturdy enough to survive the elements and worse. 
The crossbow is thin and long, and bears no unneccesary 
adornments, instead appearing a weapon suited for repeated use.

   Crude in make, mismatched pieces of metal have been riveted to 
a pair of rawhide leggings, forming a somewhat protective metal

   This rugged vest is fortified with layers of thin, overlapping 
blackened metal scales attached to a thick leather backing. The 
scales themselves are jagged, likely more to make the wearer 
appear more intimidating, but they could do some damage to anyone 
who got too close, including the wearer. Thick leather straps 
fasten the vest under the arms and down the side of the torso.

The legs of the hides dangle loose, to be tied around the wearer to
hold it in place.  Foul-smelling and infested with fleas and worse,
this crude armor provides gruesome, if functional, protection.

the helm, two oversized, red-stained fangs of a legendary fell 
beast descend to either side of the wearer's visage with a slow 
curl inward to end just beneath the chin. Three like-sized 
teeth, wickedly sharp extend back from the helm's crest, reaching 
to the rear of the head and curled downward to lend a sleek 
appearance to the otherwise stoutly-built cap.

a sharp, blackened falchion~
A sharp, blackened falchion of plain construct is here.~
   This falchion, a weapon shaped like a sword but with a broad, 
heavy blade with no point but a weighty edge, is of plain 
construct. That is, no unnecessary decoration adorns the blade, 
instead it is simple a dark wooden handle attached to a blade of 
dusky iron bearing a sharp edge.

   This leather kit is a bit larger than a clenched orc's fist, 
and seems crammed full of smaller items. A smaller oily pouch is 
within, filled with dirt, and upon closer inspection, small white 
bugs, crawling and worming incessantly. A thick discolored glass 
bottle is also within, the contents of which is a thick, acidic 
smelling liquid. Several other miscellaneous items litter the 
kit as well, from metal sutures to thick rough cloth.

A blackened iron helm sits here, a series of metal bars across the front.~
   This helm has been fashioned in a hasty manner from iron, 
blackened with the same quick approach - there are many small 
imperfections and nicks, and places where the dull metal is not 
quite as dark. Despite these minor flaws, the helm is of sturdy 
construct. Across the front of the visor, six metal bars have 
been placed, opening upwards on a creaking hinge. This cage-like 
visor allows one a superior view out of the helm compared to more 
encompassing helms.

certain sections of the gauntlets, marking out the knuckles and 
wrists of the one wearing the pieces.

numerous squat spikes jut out from the front of the object.

an ornate, embellished, steel-bladed dagger~
An ornate, steel-bladed dagger embellished with a hollowed eye socket lies here, discarded.~
   A blade of fine steel is one of the main ingredients of this 
dagger, although the shape of it is something rather odd. 
Imitating a serpent, the blade is thin, twisting, with slight 
indentations along the length. Giving off a fine sheen in even 
dim light, the blade is truly a piece of fine workmanship. The 
only other oddity about the weapon would be the hilt; made of a 
pure white material, resembling ivory, it is long and smooth, 
with only an occasional fleck of a dull grey. Embellished within 
the center of the hilt is a picture vaguely resembling that of an 
eye, although it is without pupil - a socket.

   This bulky orc, naked till a pair of stinking, dark leather 
pants, strides through the middle of a pack of labourers both 
orkish and human that work about a construction project here, 
carrying stone and lumber up and down the wooden scaffolding. 
Most of the workers are clad in nothing more than rags, and a 
small gathering of burly, leather-clad mercenaries sometimes 
spectate the lowly labourers, offering kicks and throwing rocks 
at them. The foreman seems to take little enough care of this, 
instead prowling the grounds looking for goblins and smaller men 
slacking off, giving those he finds impromptu beatings before 
casting them back to work.

a spiked, single-edged battleaxe~
A large single-edged battleaxe lies here, a spike protruding from the top.~
   Made of dark, heavy iron, this battleaxe sports a single wide, 
crescent blade with a skillfully crafted empty space between the 
handle and the edge. The space lends the weapon a somewhat 
fragile appearance, but the weight and expertly fashioned edge 
quickly erases such idea as well as to make clear that the wounds 
given by this axe will be either fatal or grievous enough to maim 
an opponent. The handle is carved out of thick oak with a long 
strip of leather wrapped tightly to it, securing the grip needed 
to use this weapon properly. A short but stout spike runs 
vertically from the top of the weapon, with a crude skull burned 
into the wood near the weapon's head.

head, wrought of solid black iron, is wide and vaguely

some caked with dried blood. It is suitable only for wielding 
with two hands, and would take someone of great strength to use 
it effectively.

An ancient black bladed dagger is here, its blade covered in shadow.~
   The blade of this dagger looks very old, the dusty black color 
worn by time. Upon closer inspection, strange runes can be seen 
running its length. The hilt and cross-guard are simple, 
blackened by fire, the hilt scarred in a crisscross pattern to 
add to one's grip. Below, a dull steel counterweight is set. 
The dagger itself looks rather normal, if not ancient, though 
occasionally, when one is not looking directly at is, a shadow 
seems to cross the weapon, as it from nowhere, disappearing when 
the weapon is looked directly at.

a bearhide vest~
A thick bearhide vest is set here.~
   This thick, sturdy vest is made of cured bearskin, the dark 
shaggy brown fur on the outside. It covers the torso very 
simply, with buttons to close it down the front. It has no 
neckline or sleeve caps, nor a lining to protect against the 
leather inside. It is a very simply designed garment meant to 
provide basic protection.

helmet xOrkish thick angular metal METAL~
a thick, angular metal helmet~
A metal helmet sits here, oddly shaped and angled.~
   Seemingly pieced together from whatever scrap metal was 
available, this metal helmet nevertheless seems stout. Pieces of 
metal have been riveted together, some long and narrow, others 
thick and square, forming a somewhat round dome. Cheek guards of 
differing length and thickness reach far down the sides of the 
helm, with a misshapen metal piece riveted between to protect the 
nose. The entire creation provides no smooth edges, and looks 
rather crude, though looks capable of protecting the head of its 
wearer.

   This thick iron gorget seems to be of orkish make. Crude yet 
effective, its composed with two bands stacked atop each other, 
each consisting of three thick, blackened iron bands, curved and 
formed together in a circle. The bands are riveted to a mesh of 
chain, allowing some flexibility, though the piece of armor 
obviously favors protection above freedom of movement.

a shrunken goblin head~
A shrunken goblin head is here upon the ground.~
   This head resembles that of a normal goblin except that it it 
is the size of a goblin's fist. Whatever caused the goblin's 
head to be so small seems to have no effect on the hair, which is 
very thick and black in color. The hair is long enough so that 
it can be gathered up and tied to something, such as a belt. The 
head is dark in color, seeming to be unevenly colored. Most is 
completely black but more greyish, ash-colored areas can be seen 
as well. The eyes and mouth appear to be sewn shut haphazardly 
using rotting pieces of sinew.

liquids in or out. A thin leather strap allows the bag to be

of mask. Openings have been left for the eyes and the nose allowing the
person wearing this to see and breath. A space has also been left open
between the folds for a mouth so the wearer could eat or drink, but the
comfort of such an action would be questionable.

   Fashioned with crude effectiveness from the feumur of a small 
bear, this bone rattle has been sanded and cleaned, making its 
surface smooth and easy to grip. One knobby end has been left 
bare, while the other has been fitted with the curved horn of 
some other animal, giving it a cruel point. The horn itself has 
apparently been hollowed out and filled with other bone 
fragments, which produces a rattling sound when the tool is 
shaken. It has been painted with crude, dark paint forming bold 
and unrepresentative designs. Around the bone at the base of the 
horn has been attached a skirt of ratty animal fur for 
decoration.

thin and unadorned, to those twisted or etched with obscure

with even the rare silver or bronze strip mingled between. 
Distinct qualities of widths and tints prove each set to be

indistinct design leaves no clues as to what the forger may have 
intended for this trinket's use.

   The hilt of this sword has been forged of black iron and has 
been wrapped quite thoroughly with leather, providing a suitable 
grip. It spouts a bronze pommel with a skull insignia upon its 
tip, crudely moulded into it in an imperfect fashion. There is a 
bell-shaped crossguard of bronze, shaped in a fairly shallow 
curve that is more than sufficient to cover the average wielders' 
hand. The blade is long, and approximately three quarters of the 
way up takes a sharp fourty-five degree shift backwards. The 
metal of the blade has been thoroughly tempered and 
fire-hardened, and would appear to be coated in some kind of 
black pigment, but for the fact that its edges are no less keen.

The mask is made of thin metal that has been painted a dark shade 
of green and bent in many places to simulate wrinkles. The face 
shown on the mask has an incredibly large nose and a large mouth 
that is held in a grin full of oversized teeth. The mask can be 
secured onto one's face by two ratty straps of rawhide.

more to a lack of skill than stylish intent. Worn $drabcolor 
cloth, more than likely scraped from another old garment, tapers 
only slightly along the abdomen, before falling a few inches 
below the waist. The sleeves have been shortened to cut across 
the upper arm, with the coarse thread already beginning to

hammer colossal ethereal two-handed GOTHRAKAHAUNTING GOOD_QUALITY METAL~
a colossal, ethereal two-handed hammer~
Almost the size of an average man, an ethereal hammer lies discarded here.~
   Nearly six foot long in all, this two-handed hammer is truly 
colossal. It appears to be entirely ethereal, having a 
translucent and flickering nature to it. The haft is some kind 
of grayish bone-like material, though entirely impossible to 
break through any mundane means, and it sharpens into a wicked 
looking point at the very base. The head is made of some heavy, 
black metal-like material that seems to entirely sap the heat 
from anything it touches. As a result, a trail of cold water 
vapor often follows behind it as it moves, as the water condenses 
out of the air.

a tattered spectral breastplate~
A piece of tattered spectral armour has been tossed aside here.~
   This breastplate is ethereal and spectral, being not entirely 
solid in this world. It bears the nicks and marks of a great 
many blows, and is incredibly tattered. The pauldrons are 
extended in a fashion that could not possibly provide any extra 
protection, and the entire belly section of the armour is absent.

a shimmering, tattered ethereal bandolier~
Flickering in and out of substance, a tattered ethereal bandolier lies here.~
   This long, ethereal bandolier fits right around the torso of a 
rather large being. It seems to be made of some vitreous metal, 
not entirely stable in the physical world as it flickers in and 
out of being. It is incredibly tattered, the metal actually 
appearing rather fabric like, stretching and tearing into fibres. 
It has several loops on the back, allowing weapons to be hooked 
in.

   Upon closer inspection, this dark brown mottled length of 
necklace has in fact been crafted from two rat-tails, tied by two 
tight knots, one at each end to the other. Small, thin hairs 
seem to line its surface giving the entire necklace a lighter hue 
in places and looks like, if placed around ones neck, would hang 
loosely down to the chest area of a smaller, bipedal creature.

weapon when it moves particularly quickly.

themselves about their hand.

mask human-leather coarsely-sewn sewn UNIQUE_RATMUK GOTHAKRAHAUNTING LEATHER~
a coarsely-sewn, human-leather mask~
Lying crumpled on the ground, a small leather mask is here.~
   This mask is made of a thin, multi-layered leather that a 
reasonably educated eye will easily know to be the leather made 
from human skin. It is crudely tanned, and looks very aged, 
having turned a dark shade of brown. In some places the leather 
has decayed a little, and so it has some areas of black marring. 
The mask itself covers the entire face of an average wearer and 
is tied on with four ribbons of the same leather, one from each 
corner of the mask. Uneven, reasonably sized slits have been cut 
for the eyes and nose of the mask, and a somewhat larger hole is 
made for the mouth - however, it has been sewed over with the 
coarse, fraying thread that the rest of the mask has been made 
from in a cage like fashion, although it is still open. Around 
the bottom of the mask, a shaggy, uneven beard of some hair 
decidedly not of humanoid origin has been attached.

   This longsword is crafted with a fine steel. The blade itself 
looks vicious with its razor-like edge, as it curves to a point 
at the tip. The hilt is grafted of a dark clad bronze with the 
skull of a dragon protruding as the pommel. A simple bright 
bronze polished ring sits in the center of the hilt. Upon the 
crossguard is the skull of a dragon with its horns wrapping 
around the gaunts on each side.

wrapped in leather for a better grip. Instead of a crossguard,
however, six large fangs are set along the side of the piece,
sweeping down and out. A quickly smoothed chip of bone serves
as a pommel.

designed to punch through armor instead. It is forged of iron,
blackened in the process, with a haft that leads down to a handle
of yellowed, bumpy antler. The design is simple, a furrow running
down the edge of each side of the head, and a rounded brass cap
at the end of the grip.

sewn with various pieces of metal. The shards are held on with tough
sinew, threaded through the leather to hold them firmly in place. The
protective quality of this piece is questionable, perhaps providing
safety from light blows, but at the expense of discomfort and aesthetic
value.

in places, making their wearing and removal a process wrought with danger. They
contain many small hiding places for vermin, as well, but do provide a bit of
extra protection.

   Thick, well treated and stitched pieces of leather form these 
bulky gauntlets, fitting well over the entirity of the hand and 
halfway up the forarm. Running along the fingers of each 
gauntlet, a long iron spike lies, coming to a halt a few inches 
from the end of the knuckles.

the rim of the cap, and then in five rows across the length of it,
are a number of short, iron barbs, riveted into the thick leather.

this jagged, bloodstained tooth was very likely from one. It is long
since dried out and dead, though blackened ichor clings to the tattered
roots still.

A battlesword with a leather-wrapped hilt lies here, blade broken near the base.~
   This once was obviously a fairly nicely made weapon, but now 
has been broken and is unusable. The blade is snapped near the 
hilt, a dull, jagged edge of several inches is all that remains. 
The hilt itself is wrapped in oiled leather, still very sturdy 
despite the abuse the weapon has taken. The pommel is a loose 
cap of brass, round and ridged.

it around the hands. While infested with fleas and giving off a

blotchy and extremely wrinkled. The material is puckered into ridges

metal that covers the mouth and chin leaves an opening for 
respiration and speech.

consequence of a smith who took too little care in preparing the 
armor to withstand the elements.

Tiny spots of rust have begun to wage their own war on the

ridges on them, giving them the potential to do damage if used to 
knee someone.

stretch from the solar plexus down to the groin. The final 
pieces are the large, hardened leather pauldrons, curved down to

A ragged shirt of maille lies in a heap here.~
   This ragged shirt of maille has been formed by countless 
individual chains linked together; to be precise, each chain is 
linked to another four. However, far from providing a near solid 
sheet of metal, the shirt is rather patchy in areas, and the 
binding of each link is far from quality work, the occasional 
chain broken and left hanging ragged. Despite all of these 
faults, the sheer weight of this piece of armour is certain to 
ensure it provides at least some protection its wearer.

A thin maille skirt lies here in a heap.~
   This ragged skirt of maille has been formed by countless 
individual chains linked together; to be precise, each chain is 
linked to another four. However, far from providing a near solid 
sheet of metal, the skirt is rather patchy in areas, and the 
binding of each link is far from quality work, the occasional 
chain broken and left hanging ragged. Despite all of these 
faults, the sheer weight of this piece of armour is certain to 
ensure it provides at least some protection its wearer.

further enhanced by all manner of dirt and rust caught up between 
the individual chains.

coif lopside maille METAL~
a lopsided maille coif~
A lopsided maille coif lies here.~
   This piece of maille or chainmail has been shaped to form a 
coif to prevent its wearer from suffering injury from slash or 
chop. Fashioned from hundreds of tightly-knit maille rings, the 
manufacture is average yet sturdy, bearing a dark, grim surface 
that betrays its yrch origin. Despite this, the coif is built 
solidly in a four by one style, offering its wearer confidence to 
face an assailant, the maille falling slightly over one side, 
giving it a lopsided appearance.

A dark-iron breastplate lies here, ridged and bladed.~
   The dark iron of this breastplate is polished and set with 
sharp, razorlike blades that glint grimly, angling strategically 
away from the armor. The metal is ridged decoratively, almost 
seeming to be made of overlapping plates. While certainly 
protective, it is also as dangerous offensively as it is 
defensively.

allowing for superior flexibility despite the rigidity of the 
metal.

Sharp metal blades extend like claws from the back of the hand,

The iron is dark and polished, and very carefully forged. The 
gauntlets flare at the cuffs, allowing them to be worn in 
conjunction with other armor.

appearance, cruel blades set along their lengths. The metal 
gleams dully in light, promising superior protection and mobility

armor, they would no doubt also serve as a nasty way to deal out 
pain in a pinch.

dark and polished, glinting grimly in light.

sharp, razorlike blades that glint cruelly. Several furrows run 
down the surface of the shield, bending toward the sharpened

handle and a sturdy leather strap are set on the rear side, 
making gripping it easy.

rust, tarnish, and nicks mar its surface, but the weapon is still

weapon, a fluted cylinder with both ends left mostly flat. A 
hole in the center of the stone allows a wooden haft to be 
inserted and lashed in place with sinew. Stained cloth is 
wrapped around the handle, little more than scraps intended to 
make handling easier. While certainly crude, this weapon will 
still hurt as readily as any other.

   Hewn out of a light-wood, efforts have been made to portray a 
wolf figurine by an amateur hand. Shallow cuts and smudged soot 
represent a creative attempt of a shaggy coat rendition, 
extending down to the jagged carve of the short tail. A 
flattened muzzle and two straight ears place this palm-size 
statue eternally in a prowling crouch, with notches fixed in 
place of the eyes.

pieces slide on each other.

A solid piece of wood with many nails has been left on the ground here.~
   Three or four crude, rusted nails line the top edge of this 
piece of wood's surface. The nails have clearly been pushed 
through the wood in a poor manner as they jut out at various 
different angles. A perhaps lethal and dangerous weapon, the 
design is of a crude fashion and would likely do little damage to 
any well defended opponent. A tattered, worn piece of leather 
has been wrapped around the bottom section of this plank for some 
form of grip.

A short, L-shaped bar is set solidly against the southern wall.~
   The short wooden bar fits solidly on the rough floor. It 
extends about eight feet straight with a perpendicular four feet 
wing closing it off against the wall on one side. It is made 
from two solid blocks of sturdy oak, but the bar's surface is a 
polished, dark cherry wood. The short overhang is comfortably 
rounded for those who sit in front of it, allowing leg room. 
Eight four-legged stools rest in front it, two of them set up on 
the shorter perpendicular wing of the bar. The inside of the bar 
is cut out to allow for storage, and an extra cushioned stool is 
placed aside haphazardly for a resting bartender.

However, it seems that this particular flower has seen more than

slow but inevitable decay towards oblivion. The delicate petals 
have begun to shrivel and dry, and spot and discolourations have 
formed upon their forms.

   Formed from a small patch of dark, umber leather, this brooch 
has been made to adorn any piece of probably shabby clothing. 
Atop the oval leather patch is a small disc of scratched, dulled 
metal made in a similar shape although its edges are roughly hewn 
and attached only by a few tiny pins. Around its edges are 
various scraps of thin, wiry metal which seem to snake around the 
brooch in a wavy pattern. A rather diverse, unique effect can be 
seen as the various coloured metals of thin wire weave together 
around a base of metal disc and tatty leather.

wearied by time. A small hole has been hewn into top of the

and far from intricate design, this necklace has probably been 
crafted by one's self from stray material or a bored merchant in 
his earlier days of practice.

   Clearly fastened by a tiny piece of wire, this dried,

rusting metal chain as some sort of trinket or charm to be worn

strange design would be hard to find in any respectable shop. 
The finger smells strongly of salts and other potent materials, 
constituting the method of preservation.

slanted iron pauldron, riveted to the cuirass and scale. Falling 
down from the front and back of the cuirass are another two plain 
iron plates, protecting one's midsection.

Platemail vambraces have been built over some scale mail sleeves here.~
   A pair of heavy scalemail sleeves form the backing of these 
vambraces, the scales small and tight knit, the occasional shiny 
brass scale seen amongst the dark iron. Fitted over each heavy 
scale sleeve is a vambrace that fits about the lower forearm, a 
curved plate that fits about the elbow, and an outwards sheet of 
iron for the upper arm. All the iron is beaten and scratched, 
the armour built purely for functionality, and not for show.

All the iron is beaten and scratched, the armour built purely for

is designed for a quick fighting style, and requires skill with

occasional chips and rough spots on its wooden sides and rim attesting
to a desire for quantity over quality in the mind of its maker. Despite
that, it is solid and watertight, and would serve well enough as a
container for whatever liquid one might choose to fill it with. Its sole
decoration is the shape of a dragon adorning one side, the serpent-like
wyrm shown unfurling its wings while unleashing a blast of flame in the
crude lines of the carving.

a thick skull-shaped face plate of darker steel affixed firmly to 
the front, notably absent of the jaw piece of the skull. The 
only holes in it are nostrils, and the two eye sockets, through 
which the wearer can see the world. The darkened steel tapers to 
the back of the neck, with side panels screwed in place, and some 
chainmail draping onto the wearer's shoulders. On the right side 
of the helm there is engraved one and a half skulls. The full 
one lies on the temple, and the other one is only partially 
engraved, and lies just behind the ear.

a blackened steel breastplate engraved with a skull~
A blackened steel breastplate engraved with a skull has been discarded here.~
   This blackened steel plate is comprised of a mirrored breast 
and back plate of thickened, rounded steel. A set of buckles and 
leather straps under each arm allows it to be taken on and off 
very easily. Buckles at the shoulders allow it to attach to 
sleeves, giving seamless coverage, while the plates stretch down 
below the waist, to attach over leggings so as to leave no gaps 
in protection. The steel is of good quality, but occasionally 
one could find a dent or two where the hammer struck it during 
the forging process. In the center of the breastplate sits an 
crudely engraved skull, looking as if it was literally scratched 
out whilst being forged. Two empty eye sockets stare out from 
the center, as though something was contemplated being put there, 
but then decided against.

more than reflect it. Two solid, steel plate form the 
breastplate and back piece of this armor. The two plates are 
connected on the left side via several strong, hinged steel 
bands. Under the plate is a couple of layers of leather, 
providing comfort to the wearer. Connected to this leather on 
the right side are a few leather straps with buckles, which are 
used to hold the plates together. Two large, spiked pauldrons 
sit atop the wearers shoulders. Three spikes protrude from these 
and inadvertently protect the wearers neck from horizontal blows.

a fearsome, skull-engraved, double-bladed waraxe~
A fearsome double-bladed axe, engraved with several skulls, has been discarded here.~
   This large waraxe, with a double-blade of finely tempered 
steel sitting atop a long haft of solid, reinforced oak, seems to 
almost radiate malice and terror, a palpable aura of its intended 
use surrounding it. Each of the identical twin blades is thick, 
deadly sharp, and bearded. Upon each face of each blade, a crude 
representation of a skull without a jaw has been rendered, and 
although the design itself is by no means fine, the engraving 
work has been done by a steady hand with meticulous care, and 
each is identical to even a keen eye. The engraving appear to 
have been filled in with some kind of dark ocher, and the designs 
take up most of the blades upon which they sit. The head is 
attached to the haft by means of several steel rivets, and the 
handle has had its own grip fashioned into it with steel, 
overlaid with a padding of leather. Upon the base of the haft, a 
pewter skull with tiny ruby eyes has been attached. The axe 
looks very well balanced, and capable of chopping through even 
thick mail armour. Overall, a very fearsome weapon to be wielded 
into battle.

An extensive steel breastplate, red-tinted, and of Orkish design lies here.~
   This piece of armour, quite distinctly Orkish in design, is 
obviously the breastplate of a very important Orc. It is 
extensive in design beyond what any normal armour smith would 
attempt, with plate upon plate and many engravings, of skulls, 
teeth, claws, axes, and other less legible things. The pauldrons 
of the shoulders are viscously spiked, angled outwards. Slightly 
inflexible, but fairly good for a suit of breastplate, the steel 
of this piece is made of what looks like a dark-grey, just short 
of black, with a red undertone. At some angles, with the right 
light, the breastplate looks as red as blood in the moonlight, 
and is truly fearsome to behold.

Discarded here is a runed steel waraxe with a pitch-black head.~
   At four feet in total length, the haft of this waraxe has been 
crafted from solid iron, nicks and chips work their way down the 
haft before reaching a thick, dull steel ring which has been 
fixed onto the bottom to allow the waraxe to be secured onto a 
harness. The double-bladed head of this waraxe is crafted from 
fine steel, blackened by fire, coloring both blades a 
pitch-black. The edges of the blades are viciously-sharp, easily 
capable of removing limbs with a couple of hefty chops. Upon the 
two blades, small sigils snake their way through the steel in 
Orkish patterns, seeming to have been etched well with obvious 
care. Overall, this waraxe has been crafted very well, and in 
the hands of a strong individual, a deadly weapon.

a wickedly-sharp, fine-steel battlesword~
A wickedly-sharp, fine-steel battlesword lies on the ground.~
   Wrought of the finest hardened-steel this superbly-crafted 
battlesword's business end has been honed to a very keen, 
razor-like edge. On end, it stands taller than most men and 
boasts a heft requiring a two-handed grip for all but the 
strongest who would dare wield it. Sporting a black, 
braided-leather hilt and lacking in pageantry of any sort, this 
no-nonsense weapon appears to have been crafted by expert 
artisans for a single end: destruction.

a gold cage necklace~
A small cage of gold lies here, attached to a cord.~
   Meant to be worn around the neck this golden ornament in the 
shape of a cage is hung from a thick leather strap, the 
craftsmanship simple but without blemishes. It is formed like a 
barrel bent slightly oval with eight bars and carries no 
decorations, only smooth and shiny gold in a reddish hue.

a chipped, yellow tooth~
A chipped tooth of dulled, grimy yellow lies here.~
   This rather large, grimy tooth has clearly seen better days 
judging from its rather dirtied, chipped appearance. Still 
bearing the form of a tooth, its edges have been lightly chipped 
and its sirface is tinted with a browny, dingy yellow.

A rotting piece of flesh lies here.~
   Perhaps hard to tell due to the amount of black and brown dirt 
that has formed the grimy substance over this piece, but it is 
human flesh. Similar in size to the largest coin, a greeny 
yellow tint has taken to the surface amongst the dirty grime and 
its flapped edges have been, for some reason, roughly cut.

   This rolled, dirtied and simply matted clump of hair has 
clearly collected months of the floor's dust and other smaller 
residue. A few of the hairs have become tangled with crumbs and 
larger pieces of soil or dirt and, on closer inspection, tiny 
pieces of flesh.

a pile of butchered corpses~
A number of butchered corpses have been piled here, swarms of flies buzzing around them.~
   The sickening stench of rotting flesh invades your nostrils in 
the immediate area of this stockpile of corpses. Bodily fluids, 
primarily curdling blood seep into the ground underneath the 
twisted mess of limbs. Upon closer inspection, one may spy 
intestines or other ghastly innards spilling from the leathery 
guts of the occasional body, or a half-clenched hand sticking 
from the pile's midst. Remains of shattered weapons and tattered 
armor can be seen mixed amongst the grimy, and in some cases 
scorched flesh. The visages of those lost are contorted in what 
can only be described as utter horror, with mouths twisted agape 
and paled eyes jarred wide. The constant buzz of flies lingers 
in the area.

a bear-headed iron torc~
A bear-headed iron torc has been left here.~
   This torc has been simply made, iron wire twisted intertwining 
to make the thick neckring. The neckring does not go full circle 
and there is a two-inch gap between the two ends. The symbols on 
the end have been made crudely but are recognizable as a bear 
head. The neckring is fairly light and is simple. It appears it 
would do a little to stop a slash to the neck.

Carved in the likeness of a prince of welsh lore, this fountain spurts water into the air~
Grey marble has been masterfully worked to form a statue of a man. He is elegant, refined, and somewhat dashing. Worn on his head is a helmet set at a rakish angle, and his grey eyes seem to blast an unholy, but well-deserved anger at his english oppressors. Gushing from his mouth is the finest, clearest blue water.

bronze, but a strange alloy of a golden sheen, great strength and 
little weight. The metal on the exterior has been nicked and 
damaged. Near the rim, a pattern of delicate vines intertwine 
and connect. 
   On the underside of the cup, at the very center, where the 
curved surface normally stands upon a flat surface, a pair of 
intertwined sigils resides, only visible when the cup is held 
upside down. Of the finest calligraphic engraving, the letters 
swirl ornately.
