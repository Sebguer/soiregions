a massive, polished brass chandelier~
A massive, polished brass chandelier hangs here, suspended by chains from the ceiling.~
   Nearly seven foot long and five foot wide, this four-tiered 
chandelier is too large for any save the largest, most stately of 
rooms. Made of twisted, well worked brass, it glints brightly 
from its own illumination. It provides a base for nearly twenty 
candles, but they are more for appearance than illumination. In 
each tier are several candles, each tier getting smaller as it 
goes down, so that the third and bottom tier is only large enough 
to support the eight oil lamps that give of the majority of its 
brilliance. twelve more total are set along the other two tiers 
in among the candles to ensure it is capable of providing light 
for even the most palatial of enclosures. It is so large however 
that is must be attached by several stout brass chains to the 
ceiling to hold its great mass aloft.

little foot bridge crosses the water out to the island, and the 
path to the footbridge and the area between it and the bench is 
all set with smooth white stones. The tips of the willows 
branches just brush the surface of the water, like a leaf-dotted 
curtain, moving gently.

a silver-etched, ruby-set, intricately-decorated longsword~
A silver-etched, intricately decorated steel longsword lies here, the large ruby in the pommel glinting.~
   This masterfully worked steel longsword is polished to a 
mirror shine and etched the whole length of the blade with a fine 
silver decor. The twisting knot-work runs down the blade on 
either side of a single narrow fuller. It is double-edged, 
two-inches wide from crosspiece to about three inches from the 
tip, where a rounded taper leads to a sharp thrusting point. The 
crosspiece itself is silver leafed and set with opals and 
moonstone, glittering in even the mildest of light. The grip is 
doeskin, undyed, wicking mosture from the palm easily and giving 
a comfortable grip. The pommel is made of bronze flaired and set 
with a bright ruby, the metal itself silver leafed. 
Understandably a work of art, the edges still seem to be 
sharpened regularly, and the metal oiled. A bright lining of 
gold has been masterfully added to the bottom of the crosspiece, 
offering a unique design with the silver top.

An exquisitely wrought, sapphire-studded dagger lies here, glinting.~
   This small, razor-honed dagger is the product of masterful
workmanship. The blade is deadly keen, made of well polished
steel, narrow and coming to a fine point. Two thin fullers
run up the length of it, chaised in silver. The crosspiece
is gold filigreed and set with three brilliant sapphires on
each side. The hilt is wrapped in indigo silk cord and nearly
as long as the blade. The pommel is dome-shapped, studded with
dozens of tiny sapphires and plated in gold. The weapon is
marvelously balanced and light, both beautiful to look at and
dangerously effective to use.

   Finely cut pieces of stained glass, set within their twisting

within a gorgeous green garden, bursting with colors. Behind it

a brilliant blue sky. There are easily three hundred individually
cut pieces of glass in this arrangement, each catching the light 
and infusing it with its own delicately mixed spray of colors.

A stained glass portrait of a fox peeking around a rose bush is here, in a fine mahogany frame.~
   This beautifully wrought piece of stained glass is about one 
foot high by two feet wide, it's of a little golden- orange fox, 
twisting about the base of a rose bush. Blooming roses are 
represnted and a dozen shades of green sparkle among the leaves. 
The little fox seems to be poking his head around the side, 
peeking at you, his foofy little tail puffing out and around the 
front of it. One ear cocked a bit funny, it is obvious the 
crafter of this fine piece spent a lot of time ensuring the fox 
was an almost too precious example of his kind.

a stained glass portrait of a Great Eagle~
A stained glass portrait of a Great Eagle, perched upon a mountain top with the moon rising behind it is here, in a silver-chaised oak frame.~
   This huge work of art is perhaps three foot wide and five foot 
high, set in a carved oak frame that has been chaised in silver. 
It represents, in splendorous detail, one of the Great Eagles, 
each plume wrought of a different cut pieces of stained glass in 
its lead fittings. It stands, wings spread, about to take flight 
or having just landed it is hard to say. It is perched upon the 
peak of a snow-capped mountain. The night sky sparkles around 
it, and the silvery face of the moon can be seen highlighting it. 
The mountain seems stark and desloate, while the Eagle itself is 
a regal representation of the noble creatures. The whole thing 
is dramatic, spraying a range of colors in the light and is large 
enough to fill even the greatest of windows.

etherial feel compared to the solid silver of the trees trunk and 
branches. Set over it are three brilliant blue sapphires; large 
and faceted to catch the light. The top is capped with silver as 
well, etched in Adunaic in the Numenian script is 'Let us rule 
wisely until the King returns'.

A suit of scalemail armour is on display here.~
   A maplewood armour display stands here, approximately two
meters in height. A suit of scalemail armour, stuffed with hay-
filled linens, is supported by the structure. Its gloved arms
have been pulled together to clasp over the pommel of a blue-
hilted sword which is held point-down before the mannequin.
  
A display of scalemail armour appears to be in excellent condition.

A glimmering mace of fine steel lies here.~
   This mace has been constructed with a flanged, steel head 
that's been sharpened to a dangerous-looking edge. It has a 
black cord wrapped about the shaft for grip and a White Tree 
carved into the handle inlaid with silver. An amethyst gemstone 
has been set into the hilt above the White Tree. Etched on one 
of the flanges is an etching of a short, bearded figure holding 
an immense battle-axe, while on another flange, in 
Numenian-Tengwar, are the sigils that would read 'Edain' to any 
that know the script.

an ankle-length, hooded deerskin vest~
A long deerskin vest lies here, beading along its hem.~
   Made of soft deerskin, this long vest trails down to the wearer's
ankles with a gracefully-cut line. With long slits up its sides, ending
at the wearer's hips, it shows flashes of the clothing or skin beneath
with every step. It clasps up the front with simple bronze lacing-rings,
making three bowties. Belt loops hold a belt if desired. Its natural
color is a rich fawn-brown, with its only real decoration a series of
geometric patterns along its lower hem. Set along the patterns are
numerous white teeth, sewn into the leather like beads. The vest has
no sleeves or sleeve-caps, its armholes simply made and roomy, but it
does boast a simple hood, deep and unlined, to keep off the weather.

Dress embroidered wooldress fine bright green TEXTILE~
an embroidered dress of fine bright green wool~
~
This comfortable-looking dress is made of finely woven bright green wool, 
and is soft and pleasant against the skin. Its bodice is gently
structured with light stays in the side seams. Its round neckline
leads into buttons that go all the way down the front, each buttonhole
carefully made with precisely the same stitches. The garment is not
gathered from the waistline but gored, so it flows smoothly down over
the hips to the ankles, with triangles of fabric sewn into each seam
to give it fullness; each triangle's uppermost point is perfectly laid
in, without the slightest puckering. White silk edges the lower hem and
the sleeve and neckline edges, with a tiny cluster of white orchids
embroidered over the right breast of the bodice. Six larger clusters
of orchids are sewn evenly around the skirt's lower edge. Durable and
easy-to-wear, it is also a soft and well-made garment.

leather. Reaching down to the calves of the wearer, the upper 
half has an elegant, slim cut, while below the hip the coat is 
flaring slightly due to a slit in the back that enables a rider 
to drap it over his legs while on horseback. The coat overlaps 
on the chest to offer more protection against the wind and can be 
closed with two vertical rows of silver buttons. The sleeves end 
in small cuffs and the wide collar can be turned up to offer a 
little protection against the elements.

A rugged, shaggy-black-furred cloak of warg fur has been discarded here.~
   This rugged, warg skin cloak of black fur is obviously been 
taken from one of the larger types of its kin. A deep, dark cowl 
tops the cloak. It appears to have seen good use, since it has 
been repaired numerous times.

battleaxe GOOD_QUALITY UNIQUE_PGERAINT_PNISTRODIN blued-steel double-bladed metal METAL~
a blued-steel, double-bladed battleaxe~
A battleaxe with two edges and made of blued metal has been left on the ground.~
   Made of double crescent blades, apparently forged from a 
single length of steel and fitted to a long, solid shaft of a 
darkly varnished wood, this battleaxe is an example of excellent 
workmanship and skill. The metal that makes the head of the 
weapon has been evidently worked long and hard in the forge, 
being somewhat lighter than it should. The steel has been blued 
through some metallurgic process, yielding a beautiful background 
to some superficial, yet detailed engravings that show two 
magnific dragons, poised to attack, their tails coiled in the 
center of the axe-head. Despite being a weapon designed more for 
strength of the blow rather than edge, the twin blades have been 
worked painstakingly to a beveled, razor feel. The shaft has 
been evidently worked to fit the eye of the axe-head precisely, 
sanded and varnished for a solid grip, either with one or two 
hands.

gleaming White Tree of Gondor has been woven into the design of 
the rug. The entire thing is quite large, stretching across an 
ample amount of flooring.

   Made from high quality steel, this plate covers from the 
collar, down to the abdomen, where it flares outwards slightly at 
the bottom, to allow one to wear a set of leggings more securely. 
The face of a tortured orc has been wrought onto the chest 
portion of the armor, fixed in a permanent look of fear. The jaw 
seems wrenched down and to the side, a terrified scream forever 
frozen. Along the collar portion of the armor, a pair of names 
are etched. In Numenian Tengwar, the left word reads 'Nivalis', 
while the right side reads 'Fallon'.

A finely-made pair of steel, chainmail sleeves lies here.~
   Crafted from hundreds, if not thousands of well-woven links, 
this garment provides protection from the shoulders down, the 
upper portion reinforced by a pair of steel plates, wrapped 
around the shoulders and slanting up, slightly. Each plate is 
engraved with a different image. The one on the right bears a 
rearing horse, while the other holds a pair of crossed swords. 
The elbows are plated with a thin layer of steel, though without 
any engravings or etchings. This piece of armor ends at the 
wrists, where latches allow it to be secured to gauntlets or 
other such armor.

A polished, silver-and-moonstone pendant on a hemp cord lies here.~
   This pendant is strung on a thick, black cord, the hemp 
strands braided together to add both a minor amount of elegance 
as well as enhance the support. In shape the silver pendant 
itself is circular with a thick band around the outside, highly 
polished and engraved with a series of simple galactic swirls. 
The inside is indented and a frosted silver, though raised from 
it is an almost mirror-like depiction of a stylized Tree of 
Gondor. Crowning the Tree, set into the outer band, are seven 
small rainbow moonstones, their irridescent surfaces shining most 
brightly beneath the light of Ithil. Engraved on the back in 
tiny Numenian script are the words: For Taergarol, to remember 
what he stands for and those who care about him.

length, sharpened iron studs and sturdy rings which are polished 
to a high sheen, have been fastened into place along the collar. 
Together this provides added protection as well as being a

has a short laying collar, and the hem hangs far enough to be 
tucked in. Overall, the outfit presents a clean, stylish look.

longsword UNIQUE_PAERUIL MASTER_QUALITY archaic steel METAL~
an archaic, steel longsword~
An archaic, steel longsword lies here, metal glinting in the light.~
   This longsword's blade is coloured a dull blue, and the 
surface pattern on the steel itself is composed of hundreds of 
swirling, light-etched regions. The meandering, watery lines 
upon the blade are marred by a series of deeply-set runes running 
the weapon's length, though they are far too faded to determine a 
mode of Tengwar, let alone to decipher. The blade itself shows 
no sign of brittleness, despite its edge being dangerously sharp. 
The brass handguard and leather-wrapped handle are plain and 
unornamented, and their shape and style seem rather outdated, 
suggesting the sword to be both utilitarian and fairly old. The 
weapon is exceptionally well-balanced and surprisingly light, and 
is likely a Master's work despite the lack of embellishment.

an emblazoned, gleaming steel breastplate~
A steel chainmail vest lies here, a breastplate engraved with a sword and star across the chest.~
   This expertly-crafted breastplate is made of a solid plate of 
steel, polished to a high gleam and is worn over a 
finely-wrought, steel chainmail vest. Both pieces are of high 
quality, the chainmail interlocking into a double-layer mesh 
while each link is particularly fine and well-woven among the 
others to create a sturdy, but lightweight sheath of flexible 
steel. The edges of the breastplate are turned, providing a 
nice, rounded trimwork while buckling onto the body with dark, 
leather straps and silver buckles. From the torso, the chain 
falls down over the hips, providing extra protection while yet 
reducing weight and improving mobility at a small cost in 
protection. Deeply-engraved into the metal across the chest is 
the recognizable herald of Greathouse Astirian, a longsword 
before a seven-pointed star, the recesses of the 
skillfully-worked design darkened to bring out the detail.

   Made of darkened steel, this sallet helm provides complete 
protection for its wearer's head. Featured on the front is a 
sharply angled visor with reinforced ridges and lined with 
bellows; small holes to allow breathing. When lowered, the visor 
provides a narrow band of visibility, the edges strengthened to 
provide more protection. On top, a prominent horsetail crest of 
maroon-dyed hair stands at stiff attention, curving down the back 
of the helm in a gentle slope that extends low enough to provide 
protection to the nape. Fixed on the inside is a soft pad of 
cotton and supple leather, adding small comfort to the helm.

   Smooth and producing only a small gleam of light due to its 
darkened hue of steel, this bevor is designed with articulated 
plates set with rivets. Its design fully encompasses its 
wearer's neck, extending below the shoulder level with straps to 
help distribute the load of a cuirass. Reaching up to the chin, 
it has one fitting that allows the head to pivot up and down 
slightly, only allowing a small range of motion. Thin pads of 
quilted cloth provide a little cushin for the throat around the 
inside of the bevor, while sturdy buckles secure it around the 
back.

   Vaguely mimicking the musculature of a man in peak physical 
condition, this dark-hued steel cuirass is formed by two full 
plates of steel hinged about the shoulders and ribs with 
adjustable straps. Covering the shoulders are curved spaulders, 
adding protection to the front and back of the shoulder while 
leaving the underarm exposed to the chainmail shirt beneath. The 
circumference of hip is ridged and creates a subtle concave shape 
over the front, further strengthening the piece. The back plate 
is broad and simply shaped to protect the back, with the neck 
opening designed to seamlessly fit with a bevor.

   Providing full protection of the arms from the shoulder to

turn any more glamourous upon being polished. The shield's 
surface is not uniform in color, however, and instead contains a 
myriad of swirling, light-etched regions of a watery-blue shade, 
suggesting that the steel may have been mixed with some sort of 
impurity during the forging. A pair of leather straps on the 
reverse are used to fasten the roundshield to the user's arm.

A mask of ash bark has been left here adorned with feathers and fangs.~
   This mask is nothing more than a piece of ash bark with a loop 
of leather fastened to the eye holes to keep it to the wearers 
face. The eye holes are crude and jagged triangles, pointing to 
where the user's nose would be and looks like someone had just 
thrust a sharp object through the bark to cut them out quickly. 
A mouth hole has also been cut in this fashion, the jagged edges 
looking like sharp pointy teeth so that the overall impression is 
an aggressive, open-mouthed, almost leering expression. The only 
other decoration is where the leather fastens to the eyes, a few 
feathers and fangs attached with cord to dangle down the sides. 
The mask reaches down to chin level and covers the entirety of 
the face.

shortbow bow UNIQUE_PRAGNYYRIS feather-and-fang-decorated feathers fangs recurved yew-wood WOOD~
a feather-and-fang-decorated, recurved shortbow~
A recurved, yew-wood shortbow lies here decorated with feathers and fangs.~
   On closer inspection, underneath the decoration, this shortbow 
is of a fine make and quite exquisitely-crafted. The finest 
materials have been used in the construction of this bow. The 
wood, stout, gives a strong resistance to bending. Brown 
leather, soft and supple, is wrapped around the middle of the 
bow, providing gripping, and a taut bowstring of braided linen is 
stretched between the ends. Somewhere along it's life it has 
aquired a decoration of feathers and sharp canines. The 
decoration dangles down from either end of the wood, fastened on 
with leather cord. Simple carvings of wolves and bears have been 
etched lightly into the wood, so as not to decrease the bow's 
power or effect it's performance. At the top of the shaft has 
been carved what looks like a hawk of some kind, wings spread, 
looking down towards the ground.

A pair of brutal-looking, leather-strapped antler pieces have been left here.~
   Each point sharpened further to increase the brutality and 
barbarity of these hand weapons, they have been cut from the 
original antler in a way that would fit into the wielders hand. 
When gripped, the middle and third finger are splayed apart, a 
sharp barb of of antler protruding out from the gap. Two other 
sharpened antler points also protrude from either side of the 
users hands, enabling them to be used in more than a straight 
forward punch.

of the ring are the words "Our Love Eternal."

A masterfully-crafted, one-handed spear with a watery-steel head has been left here.~
   This well-balanced, masterfully-crafted weapon consists of an 
ornate yet sturdy black, ash shaft upon which a highly-tempered 
steel head has been mounted. A deadly, diamond-shaped head that 
angles backwards before angling down to a razor-sharp point 
adorns one side of the shaft while the other has a silver buttcap 
to counter the weight of the head. The head of this weapon has 
been forged of the highest-quality steel which offers a 
bluish-like glow and tint to it's surface. Thick strips of 
leather have been wrapped around the shaft partway up it's 
five-foot length to provide a comfortable grip for the hand. The 
spear is as lethal as it seems, especially in the hands of a 
skilled user.

   Dominated by a single, mirrored plate of round steel that 
covers the left breast, and a pair of steel-banded pauldrons that 
offer a great deal of protection to the wearer's vulnerable heart 
and shoulderline, this unusual style of armor is clearly unique. 
While composed almost entirely of thick leather that covers the 
majority of the chest, and abdomen, it has been reinforced with a 
series of bronze rivets that run across the belly and back of the 
piece. The leather is dyed in an unpatterned yet skillful 
fashion a mix of light browns, tan, and cream colors. It has a 
light grey lining of fur, inconspicuously concealed beneath the 
hardened leather shell.

A masterfully-crafted, engraved champron of tempered steel lies here.~
   This champron has been fashioned from steel, the metal 
tempered so that it gives off a bright, silvery-blue sheen. It 
is made of solid plates forged together to fit over a mount's 
head snugly yet comfortably due to the light, leather padding 
that lines the inside of the piece itself. Two ridges protrude 
slightly at the eyes, offering additional protection for the 
mount yet not obscuring its vision while two, curved protrusions 
stick up slightly to protect the mount's ears. At the base of 
the champron are reinforcements of bronze studs while buckles 
fitted there allow for the attachment of a manefaire. Down the 
center of the champron where the armor encases the steed's 
muzzle, fine engraving has been worked into the metal, just as 
masterful as the rest of this piece.

A well-crafted, iron champron has been left here."~
   This well-crafted champron has been crafted out of quality 
iron and has been carefully sculpted to fit the head of a steed. 
The armor is broad and flat as it extends from the top of the 
steed's head to its muzzle and carries the engravings of vines 
with thorns along the whole length of its surface. This piece 
slopes inward slightly near the steed's eyes to avoid hindering 
sight and protrudes adequately near the steed's ears for ample 
protection. The whole piece is held in place by a series of 
dark-green leather straps with thin, gold braiding that fasten 
along the bottom of the horse's head. An impression of a small 
anvil has been set into the underside of the champron.

round steel pommel at the base of the hilt. Overall, the

craftsmanship easily belies its deadly efficiency as an armament 
of war.

a long, flowing, sleeveless gown of lily white~
A long, flowing, sleeveless gown of lily white lies crumpled here in a heap.~
   Masterfully detailed, this gown's bodice has been decorated 
with a delicate design of climbing vines and the heart-shaped 
leaves of ivy. Stemming from the front, thin straps pass over 
the shoulder and cross each other, the only covering of the 
plunging back. The skirt flows smoothly down, hugging the hips, 
flaring outward as it nears the ground. A train of the finest 
lily white linen sweeps along behind the wearer of this elegant 
gown.

A well-made pair of claw-striped, courbouilli leggings is here.~
   Made of supple, tight-fitting leather, these leggings were 
designed to ease the wearer's ability to travel. For protection, 
two rigid courboulli skirts dyed red and black, resembling a set 
of claw marks, up and down the length of the armor, have been 
riveted to the waist and along either leg to cover the thighs. 
The same rigid leather has been riveted to the knee area and down 
the shins.

protection as can be provided. The left vambrace appears to be 
shorter than the other to allow the wearer a bracer for archery. 
Expertly dyed, these vambraces have been left red and black, in a 
pattern mimicking claw marks, uniformly done over the entire 
piece.

longsword filigreed steel gleaming masterwork UNIQUE PGERAINT METAL~
a filigreed-steel, gleaming masterwork longsword~
A gleaming longsword, the surface filigreed, has been placed here.~
   This longsword is, without doubt, fashioned by the hands of a 
Master of its trade, and even then it is exceptional in all 
counts. Made of some sort of steel, the surface of the blade 
does not glitter like gondorian swords do, but glows dully on any 
light, marked with ten millions of meandering lines which makes 
it an amazing sight, unlike any common weapon. The hilt, under a 
carefully corded wrapping of some dark, finely-cured leather, is 
made of lebethron wood, which has been sanded and varnished with 
skill, keeping its beautiful, fair color. The crossguard is made 
of some magnific, glittering metal that reflects any sort of 
light and image and seems impervious to mar or scratch. The 
length of the blade has been carefully worked until the edge has 
a glass-like feel, which indicates that under the hand of one 
skilled, this weapon would be able to shear flesh, bone and even 
armor without a major exertion. A circular pommel, made of the 
same glittering metal has been set to counterweight the blades' 
swing, bearing a extremely detailed engraving of a star with 
eight rays, each set with a smattering of what seem to be some 
sort of shining jewels, lending a bright trail to any motion done 
quickly. Overall, this weapon is a magnific example of gondorian 
craft and, from the exotic and fine quality of the materials, 
evidently meant for one of high stature.

broadsword EXPERT_QUALITY sword heavy filigreed steel METAL PGERAINT UNIQUE_EOTHELM~
a heavy, filigreed-steel broadsword~
A heavy broadsword of filigreed-steel has been forgotten here.~
   This longsword has been fashioned by the hands of a Master of 
its trade, displaying excellence in the metallurgy and work 
involved. Wider than the usual longswords toted by men, this 
broadsword has a solid heft to it, and is probably forged with a 
specific person in mind, being slightly longer and heavier than 
the common type. Made of some sort of steel, the surface of the 
blade does not gleam like westerner weapons do, yet has a dull, 
bluish glow on any light, marked with millions of meandering 
lines which makes it an amazing sight, unlike any common weapon. 
The crossguard has been made of solid steel and seems unmarred on 
its making, hinting at a cast work. The length of the blade has 
been carefully worked until the edge has a glass-like feel, 
offering those strong enough to wield it a devastating, powerful 
blow against flesh or armor. The pommel is made of a circular 
piece of solid, blued steel, offering a comfortable 
counterbalance to the weight of the weapon. Slower than other 
comparable blades, without doubt the added weight and quality of 
the metal insure that once this lands on a foe, a severe injury 
is dealt. A great example of gondorian craft, the only mark the 
blade has is a small engraving of the White Tree by the hilt.

   This armored vest has been masterfully crafted in layers, the 
outer and inner layers made of thick, leather courbouilli that 
fit the wearer snugly. However, in between is placed a 
skillfully worked plate, the metal molded to custom fit a 
feminine form. The breastplate itself is only a half piece, 
curving over the wearer's chest and upper torso while padded, 
cotton batting absorbs blows directed to the abdomen. The 
leather softens as it moves closer to the hips and waist, 
allowing for full freedom of movement. This cleverful armor 
serves to offer lightweight protection as well as camouflage 
while in the wilds, having been dyed a dark green in color.

   This sturdy vest is a creation of masterful quality. Thick, 
courbouilli layers envelope a breastplate fitted to the upper 
torso of a male figure, covering his chest while leaving his 
lower abdomen protected solely by the leather. The thin but 
protective plate stretches from each shoulder of the wearer but 
the abdomen has been padded comfortably by cotton fabric to 
further absorb blows while leaving the hips and waist with full 
freedom of movement. The outer layer of leather has been dyed in 
green and brown colors into a pattern that allows the wearer to 
blend in unseen in forest terrain while wearing this lightweight 
but very durable body armor.

the fabric. Black, silk laces tie at the back, allowing one to 
tighten the garment to create a slimming effect when worn by the

straps riveted in place beneath them to fasten over ones

longsword lebethron fine forged PLITHAN_CUSTOM METAL~
a lebethron-hilted, finely-forged steel longsword~
A finely made longsword is discarded here, seemingly forgotten.~
   Forged of a brilliant high-quality steel, this standard 
three-foot blade is astounding to look at. Though plain on the 
blade, it has been masterfully forged without chip, scratch, or 
imperfection, being a bit wider than a normal longsword and 
sharpened just to keep an edge, but not too thin to be brittle 
and break once in combat. The hilt and crossguard seems to be 
the main focal point of the weapon, as the crossguard, made of a 
thicker, blackened steel, curves gently down, allowing enough 
room for the wielder's hand to be protected and the sword to be 
maneuvered. The finely carved lebethron wood hilt , wrapped with 
a tough leather dyed white, bulges outward where the palm of the 
hand should be, allowing a better grip. The pommel is made of 
iron and bigger than normal to accommodate the wider, heavier 
sword. On the end of the pommel, a broken-tipped star has been 
engraved out and then filled with silver, giving it the 
impression of shine as the northern star might in the midnight 
sky.

mace EXPERT_QUALITY engraved flanged green steel UNIQUE_PILYTHE EXPERT METAL PGERAINT BySaladin~
a green-steel, engraved flanged mace~
A flanged mace made of engraved green steel has been forgotten here.~
   This heavy mace is made out of eight flanges of solid, weighty 
steel, which has been worked with some metallurgic process to 
obtain a matte, strangely green finish. The flanges are straight 
and run the length of a hand, the sides filed down and the 
corners sharpened so a skilled user can cause injury, no matter 
where the mace lands. The core of the weapon has been forged 
from the same metal and worked in a way that the flanges come 
naturally from it, belaying the impression that the weapon has 
been drop forged rather than assembled. A small spike tops the 
end of the haft, which has been made from solid, aged and 
varnished oak, on which leather has been tightly wrapped, 
allowing a secure and comfortable grasp. The metal has been 
carefully engraved with a pattern of oak leaves, branches and 
growing acorns, fashioned with a detail which takes advantage of 
the green surface to give an idea of life and growth. A 
beautiful display of craftsmanship and a dangerous weapon, the 
weight and design of the mace make it a tool ideally suited for 
crushing, devastating blows through most types of armor. A 
sindarin letter G has been discreetly set on the base of the 
head, where it meets the haft.

A narrow longsword with a basket hilt has been dropped here.~
   Made from some exotic metal or alloy, this longsword is longer 
than usual, almost reaching four feet, and narrower than the 
norm. The surface of the sword bears an exotic, filigreed 
finish, as if millions of meandering lines had taken hold of the 
steel, drawn with calligraphic effort, although no evidence of 
engraving or marking can be perceived. Sharpened closely and 
thinly, this weapon's narrow blade has a fast, speedy performance 
in the hands of a skilled user, lending itself for quick slashes 
or deep stabs with its acute, razored tip. The crossguard is 
straight and combines with a basket hilt of wondrous workmanship, 
which offers a wrapping, secure protection to the hand of the 
wielder, painstakingly worked to resemble an entangling rosebush 
of metal and enamel. The attention put into this part of the 
weapon is surprising, the vines rendered carefully and enameled 
in a deep green color, the rosebuds set with what seems to be 
flashing rubies. Evidently fashioned by the hand of a master in 
westernesse weaponry, this longsword is unique both in design, 
materials and adornment, a heirloom to be passed through 
generations.

   Slightly longer than a typical greatsword, this weapon's 
length nears five and a half feet in total and almost half a foot 
in width. Evidently fashioned for one of great strength, and 
intended to be wielded with two-hands, the blade's holds a nearly 
effulgent shine and a result of the expertly-forged steel that 
has been folded to give the appearance of lines lazily making 
their way through the steel. One side of the sword sports a 
weaving circle of scrolling text, At the bottom of the blade 
where it meets the bronze crossguard, an engraving of an 
ornamental scroll engraving on one side that starts from the base 
of the crossguard, weaving its way into a circle encompassing a 
kite-shield with a longsword in front, crossing diagonally. On 
the other side of the greatsword a small wolf is engraved howling 
at a crescent moon. A hilt carved of lebethron wood has been 
carved to accentuate the gnarls and heavy grain of the wood, 
ending the hilt is a polished bronze pommel.

An elegant, etched bodice dagger has been forgotten here.~
   This dagger's steel blade is thin and razor-sharp, polished to 
shine like a torch in the darkness, refracting here and there in 
the available light. It sports a beautifully carved, curved hilt 
of fair lebethron wood. The grain of the wood hilt swirls lazily 
throughout the hilt, shown only when the black leather wrapping 
is taken off. Great care to detail has been given for this 
dagger's appearance as an exuberant etching and engraving has 
been done. The etching starts on the golden band around the 
bottom of the dagger's hilt, where an elegant filigree of ivies 
has been set into the gold. The pommel is made of gold, holding 
a small emerald. The leather cording has been masterfully 
stamped with the same ivy pattern, wrapping diagonally up the 
hilt to give the impression that the ivy climbs and grows. This 
pattern is also carefully etched into the blade, starting at its 
base where the ivy curls, making a bed from which a single golden 
etched lily to sprouts from, in full bloom. Although highly 
decorative and evidently, intended as a display piece for a 
woman, the metal of the blade is strong, being able to slice 
through exposed flesh or stab through its acute tip with ease, 
lending itself for service as a concealed weapon.

an asymmetric, smoky-steel two-handed battleaxe~
An asymmetric, smoky-steel two-handed battleaxe has been left here.~
   This magnific weapon has been evidently fashioned with one 
purpose in mind, and that is to enact violent injury to whomever 
the wielder attacks. Forged from some sort of steel, the surface 
of the blade holds a matte, smoky finish, which has been 
performed as part of the forging process, as if the metal borne 
swirls of vapor under a case of glass, giving a unique appearance 
to it. Asymmetric on its form, one side of the weapon holds a 
thick, hefty axe head, worked carefully to hold a firm edge, 
although evidently the damage is compounded more from the inertia 
of the swing rather than by the sharpness of the metal. On the 
opposite side, a thinner blade, curved like a scythe, has been 
carefully honed into a papery-thin edge, for quick, long slicing 
unto unprotected flesh. The hilt is made of a carefully shaped 
and strong piece of ebony, wrapped with leather at two thirds for 
a better grip. Weighty and sturdy, this masterwork axe can only 
be wielded effectively by one of great strength and girth, but 
once it is handled, it can inflict devastating wounds to most 
types of opponents.

longsword GOOD_QUALITY sword polished engraved engravings blade steel PROFICIENT METAL PGERAINT MT_BLADES WARDENRY_ONLY~
a polished longsword with an engraved blade~
A polished longsword with engravings on the blade has been left here.~
   Fashioned from quality steel, this longsword's blade gleams 
slightly on the light, revealing no evident marks of the hammer 
and holding a polished sheen under most circumstances. Assembled 
solidly, and clearly intended for daily use, the weapon has a 
strong, bronze crossguard which has been worked to keep an off 
tone, while the hilt is made out of some riveted hardwood, 
wrapped with a generous amount of soft leather to insure the 
grip. The edge has been worked closely, to allow consistent 
injury both to armored and unarmored opponents. A long fuller, 
half the length of the blade, has been engraved on each side with 
tengwar sigils, well set on the surface of the metal, with a 
darker tone. The pommel, a solid, weighty disk of bronze, holds 
a drop-forged White Tree on one side and a Sword and Star on the 
other, revealing that this is a weapon to be used by those in 
service to a Gondorian Lord.

mace razor flanged edged blue STEEL METAL PLITHAN sharp~
a razor-edged, flanged mace of blue steel~
A sharp looking, flanged mace of blue steel has been abandoned here.~
   Forged from blue steel, this razor-edged, six-sided mace has 
been masterfully made. The head of the mace is composed of six 
separate, razor-sharpened blades of steel, with an average hand's 
length. When looking down upon the six pieces from a top-angle, 
the mace takes on an six pointed star shape. A polished steel 
shaft has been forge-welded onto the head where a tough black 
leather cord has been wrapped around the base of the haft. The 
shaft has been grooved in a downward spiral, stopping at a raised 
part where the leather cording starts. Due to the sharpening, 
this mace could easily tear into the flesh of the defender with 
little effort while still able to inflict blunt blows due to the 
way it is wielded.

#5A chubby, baby boy with chartreuse-green eyes is here.#0~
   Encircling the crown of this baby boy's head is a vibrant 
downing of feathery-soft, aurulent-colored hair. His eyes are a 
bright and wide chartreuse-green in color which contrast subtley 
with the dollop of red on the apples of each of his chubby 
cheeks. His skin is soft and light-pink, a visible testament to 
his hale health. He kicks his feet and waves his arms rather 
animatedly, observing his surroundings with curiosity.

a steel-broadhead arrow with $color fletchings~
An arrow with a menacing steel broadhead and $color fletchings has been left here.~
   This very finely made arrow has a hardwood shaft and carefully 
dyed with indigo fletching. The tip is a razored, wide broadhead 
forged of steel, allowing a heavy, gaping wound to anything hit 
with it. Those versed in archery would consider it the work of 
an expert.

crossbow skeletal PMacharius stock recurve lath WOOD~
a recurve lath crossbow with a skeletal oak stock~
A somewhat crude recurve crossbow with an oak stock lays here on the floor, collecting dust.~
   With the body a simple skeleton of solid oak, this crossbow is 
made less for pleasing the eye, and more for function. Blackened 
steel fittings make up the mechanics of this ranged weapon, 
giving it a strong and durable manner. Fit across the front of 
the crossbow is a sandwich of material. Yew has been layered 
over sinew and under the sinew, more yew. Some process has been 
used to give the lath of yew a recurve, a more powerful and 
accurate launch made possible by it.

a crossbow bolt with a steel-bladed head~
A small length of wood with a steel tip lays here on the ground.~
   Crafted from a small length of oak, this bolt is solid and 
durable. Flight feathers have been fitted and dyed the colour of 
tree bark. The head, which is made of a pair of crossed 
bolt-heads, forms a cross when staring straight at the arrow. To 
give the quarrel a low profile, the steel has been carefully 
blackened.

crossbow finely made oak stock thick etched lath recurved PMacharius WOOD~
a finely made recurve lath crossbow with a thick oak stock~
A well-crafted recurve crossbow with a masterfully etched oak stock lays here, steel fittings gleaming in the light.~
   Made from the finest oak wood, the stock and frame of this 
crossbow are thick and strong. With steel fittings set well into 
the wood, the oak is reinforced by an inch-wide band of steel 
around the end of the stock, thick yet unimpeding. The stock has 
been made broader than it perhaps should be, though the nature of 
the etchings should make this reason obvious. Carefully carved 
into one side of the wood is the heraldry of a half sun above a 
horizontal blade. In the Numenian mode, scripted in Sindarin 
symbols, an etching has been made surrounding this image. The 
reverse side of the stock holds a careful embellishment of a 
woman's features. Sharp does her face appear, a regal nose set 
above full, firm lips. Though a slight profile of the woman is 
done, a single ear is visible under a long lock of hair, small 
and slightly pointed. Her expression is slightly guarded, eyes 
set into their expression permanently in the wood. The lath of 
the crossbow has been made of yew and sinew, layered twice in a 
sandwiching and recurved. The structure of the 'bow' gives a 
powerful and accurate shot when used.
