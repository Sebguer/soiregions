wyrm DRUADAN_TOMB black-scaled ridge-backed~
a black-scaled, ridge-backed wyrm~
A black-scaled, ridge-backed wyrm slithers here.~
   This horrid creature resembles a great snake - wingless, and 
shod in tough, black, scaly skin. Its body is sinewy and thick - 
at least two feet in diameter at its widest point - and it seems 
about twenty feet in length. Its wide, reptilian head is crowned 
with many spikes of horn, and ends in an upturned nose. Its back 
is ridged, and lined with serrated, overlapping scales that dully 
reflect any ambient light. Its black lips hide a long row of 
teeth, yellow-stained and wicked sharp. The scales of its 
underbelly are worn from movement but appear resilient 
nevertheless. Its narrow eyes, like shards of the blackest opal, 
are dark and penetrating. Hot, rotten breath issues from its maw 
whenever open.

a monstrous, red-eyed cave bear~
A monstrous, red-eyed cave bear is hunched here.~
   This old, adult cave bear is covered in glossy, night-black 
fur, its coat rent in many places by wicked scars of a pale hue. 
The snout of the bear is somewhat narrow in profile, lined by 
mottled grey lips that froth with spittle, and housing ridges of 
short, razor-like teeth. The bear's great hunched shoulders 
support massive, muscle-bound limbs that end in wide paws, each 
foot thickly padded, and bedecked with claws of a deadly 
sharpness. The eyes of the bear are slender, and stained a 
frightening crimson.

A slender-muzzled, grey-furred timber wolf prowls here.~
   Narrowed yellow canines sprout from the slender muzzle of this 
fully-grown male timber wolf, honed to a razor's sharpness. 
Dusty grey-brown fur coats the creature's sinewy frame, growing 
lighter in hue near the feet. Its large, splayed paws are 
thickly padded and equipped with a set of keen claws. Amber eyes 
adorn its head, glinting with a predatory glare.

a hulking, black-lipped grizzly bear~
A hulking, black-lipped grizzly bear stalks the woodland here.~
   This fully matured bear has reached a monstrous size. Though 
it usually lumbers along at a gradual pace, its broad, 
thickly-muscled haunches suggest a capability for deadly bursts 
of speed. Its muscle-roped frame is wrapped in a coat of grizzly 
brown fur, which glistens silver-grey from the right angle. 
Thick, black lips curl about the base of the creature's 
knife-like teeth, no less keen that the hooked claws that issue 
from its great, flat paws. The back of the bear is bony and 
ridged, its shoulders high. It seems to have a very aggressive 
mien.

A man with blond-hair and brown eyes stands here, keeping watch over the area.~
   The blond hair of this man has been cut off so that it stops 
just before his eyebrows. The eyebrows are of the same color 
that his hair is. The end of this man's nose has been cut off, 
leaving only a scar to replace what used to be the tip of his 
nose. A thin pair of lips rest beneath the man's nose, with a 
single scar running down from one of the corners of his lips to 
his chin. His build is muscular and shows signs of many years of 
battle.

A wart-covered troll with slate-gray skin looms here.~
   Numerous knobs and protrusions sprout from the thick, gray 
hide of this lumpish brute's limbs and head. Its heavy, sagging 
arms are studded with wiry black hair and end in broad hands that 
sport cracked and grimy nails. A fat-lipped, drooping mouth 
scarcely conceals its wedge-shaped teeth and its knobby chin and 
short, squat neck are often slick with saliva. The troll's eyes 
are small, pinkish, and pig-like.

a hunchbacked, bow-legged troll~
A hunchbacked, bow-legged troll lurks here.~
   This lumbering troll's broad frame is so badly hunched as to 
appear bent almost double. Its long, wart-pocked arms hang so 
low to the ground that, when moving, it occasionally plants a 
huge palm upon the earth as its tree-trunk legs work to keep the 
brute upright. Chipped, yellow teeth jut from its massive jaw, 
some pointing straight forward while others rise, tusk-like, to 
point at the troll's bulbous nose. Dark, close-set eyes glare 
out at the world from under a broad, shaggy brow.

A wrinkled, one-eyed troll stares about.~
   A sickly, whitish cup of bone, surrounded by knots of puffy 
gristle, mars the side of this broad troll's lopsided skull. Its 
short, thick neck is twisted to one side, perhaps from long years 
of peering forward with its one baleful looking, yellow-rimmed 
eye. Huge, knobby knuckles sprouting coarse, black hair make 
this brute's hands look almost like paws. A fat, shapeless 
abdomen sags down toward the troll's knees. Its bulky frame is 
held aloft on flat, splay-toed feet of great size.

   Beneath scum-crusted, watery eyes, this troll's brownish-gray 
flesh sags into a pair of moist, drooping jowls that completely 
conceal its neck, hanging down onto its broad, shapeless breast. 
The bulk of this creature's limbs no doubt conceal considerable 
strength, but its arms, trunk, and bowed legs show no real 
definition of any kind, swaddled as they are in folds of thick, 
scabby hide. The yellowed nails of its hands are long, dense, 
and wickedly sharp.

   Beads, bits of bone, feathers, and blue-black tattoos mark the 
faces, bellies, and arms of these wild-looking people. Their 
skin tones range from a reddish-brown to a sallow, olive hue. 
Their hard eyes are dark, as are the tangled and braided locks of 
their hair and beards, save where age or old injuries have shot 
through streaks of white or gray. Many have crooked limbs, 
missing teeth, and ugly scars; testament to short, hard lives in 
the wild.

BROKEN DO NOT LOAD~
a war charger with brick red skin~
A war charger with brick red skin is here~
   This handsome brick-red warhorse stands nineteen hands high, 
pawing at the ground with great black hooves. Its front 
shoulders are very broad, supported by powerfully muscled legs. 
Its mane is black as coal, the shiny hair resting lightly on the 
right side of its beefy neck. Deep midnight-black eyes gaze out 
soulfully on the world, as its wide nostrils snuffle loudly and 
its lips pull back, revealing strong, shiny teeth. The animal's 
hindquarters are a solid mass of muscle, its long lustrous tail 
whipping about idly as it waits here patiently.

something fierce quite often when something catches her

her fluffy face, while her tiny nose is a patch of pink amongst 
the pale hues of her extremely fluffy fur. The soft grey of her

tip of her tail. The tips of her large ears have a large amount 
of tufty upon them, giving the little creature an almost comical 
appearance.

of her nose has a white streak on it similar to those that can be 
found upon the rest of her body. Despite her old age, her fur is 
still quite soft and plush. Large green grace her fluffy face 
while the tips of her ears hold just a bit of tuft to them.

a narrow-eyed, brown haired elf~
A narrow-eyed, brown haired elf lingers here.~
   Locks of a walnut hue are bound back in a simple braid to 
clear this male elf's face. His brow is high and descends with 
perfect symmetry to meet narrow, almond-shaped eyes. The line of 
his jaw is fine, if somewhat slender, and his lips too are 
narrow, lending themselves readily to neither a smile nor a 
frown. His shoulders, chest, and limbs are shapely and 
well-proportioned, though in no wise bulky; the strength 
suggested there is one of swift flexibility rather than brute 
power.

coal-black eyes look out at the world in a predatory fashion, and

a brutally-scarred, black-furred warg~
A hulking, brutally-scarred, black-furred warg is here.~
   Matted, black fur covers the hulking frame of this powerfully 
built warg. Standing easily as tall as a man at the shoulder, 
his massive head bows down slightly lower, supported by a huge 
neck and ends in a long muzzle filled with razor sharp fangs and 
one long canine, the other is half its length, possible lost in 
some ancient battle. A large, deep scar runs across the muzzle, 
partially revealing gums and teeth on one side, and over an empty 
left eye socket, ending in a tuft of hair where one of its ears 
should be. Massive paws, as large as a man's head, top each of 
his powerfully built legs. A short, stumpy tail completes this 
monster of a beast.

a formless soldier type~
A formless soldier type is here.~
   This gaunt-looking soldier observes their surroundings with 
keen and wary eyes. They have an alertful watchfulness about 
them at all times, never seeming completely at ease. Despite 
their somewhat rustic, weather worn appearance, they hold 
themselves with a proud air, and sense of purpose. Their hands 
never stray far from their weaponry.

Gyrgak HILLMEN_LEADER grotesquely-scarred rat-faced man~
a grotesquely-scarred, rat-faced man~
A grotesquely-scarred, rat-faced man lingers here.~
   Hideous is the only word that can be used to describe this man 
at first glance. Scars travel their way all across every exposed 
piece of skin. Upon further investigation, they appear to be of 
a ritualistic nature, swirling and spiraling across his skin. 
Long, dreadlocked dirty brown hair is matted upon his head, with 
long stalks hanging down in front of his face. A big bushy beard 
is also dreaded near the bottom and a mangled set of teeth are 
set in dry, cracked lips. A long, sloping nose gives him a very 
rat-faced appearance. His build is small, yet stocky, showing a 
very firm base.

A short, rangy man with thick, shaggy eyebrows stands here.~
Standing not even quite five feet tall, the only feature that
really stands out at all is his thick, shaggy eyebrows. His
eyes are a dark, chocolate brown, and his skin is tough and
weather-worn. Thick, hairy arms end in equally thick, stubby
fingers and his legs appear to be equally as muscled.

a swarthy-skinned, hazel-eyed young woman~
(null)~
Of an average height, thick and curly auburn locks trail
down the back of this woman's head, a bit unkempt in its
keeping. Dark green eyes peak out from beneath this
woman's thin eyebrows and constantly dart back and forth,
staying alert of her surroundings. Her arms and legs are
well-muscled and her fingers, perhaps a bit oddly in the
contrast are long and tapered, the nails upon which are
cracked and chipped.

A large, hook-nosed man with large eyes stands here.~
This large, bulky man is of average height, but of
impressive girth. If it were not for his darker skin
tones, he could possibly be mistaken for a dwarf. His
arms bulge with muscles, while his massive gut hangs
out over his waist, supported by a set of powerful legs.
Matted, chestnut-brown hair drapes against his face,
fixed with bone fetishes plaited into the mess. His
eyes are black and uncharacteristically large.

A tall, weathered man, with fierce dark brown eyes stands here.~
This man's hawkish features lend to his stern
appearance, his features cold and hard, looking like
they could be carved from granite for all their
expressiveness, or rather, the lack thereof. His
appearance is neat and he is relatively well-groomed,
his hair braided into plates with bone charms and
hardly any stubble at all touches this man's face.
He is well-muscled and walks with a confident stride.

A crooked-toothed, bulbous-nosed man is standing here loosely.~
   This man is tall and skinny, with a narrow face and pointed 
chin. A pair of blueish-grey eyes frame a sharp nose, his lips 
thin and ears small. He has lengthy arms with slender fingered 
hands that hang at his sides and stalkish legs that support his 
body on two long feet. Strawish hair encircles the crown of his 
head, which is bald. When revealed, one can notice his crooked 
front teeth.

a weathered man with tangled black hair~
A weather-beaten man with tangled black hair stands here.~
   Tall and lean, this man has clearly seen something of the 
outdoors. His skin is lined and weather-beaten, though he is far 
from old; the paleness of his skin is mostly masked by dirt, 
though some half-hearted attempts appear to have been made at 
washing his face, at least, for it has been smudged off the 
cheeks and away from his eyes and mouth. His tangled black hair 
falls past his shoulders, and seeing twigs or bits of leaves 
entwined in it is no unusual occurrance, and his face shows the 
evidence of several days without shaving. On either side of his 
nose are set grey eyes with a sharp glint to them.
