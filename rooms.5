Base Room for Minas Morgul~
   This is the base room for Minas Morgul, the current abode of 
the Witch King of Angmar, servant of the Dark Lord Sauron. 
#5Nix#0 is currently the project lead for this zone; all changes 
and/or additions must be passed through her before they are moved 
to the player port. 
   Morgul Vale and the Tower of Cirith Ungol are also built in
this zone.

At the Bottom of a Spiral Stair~
   A meandering spiral staircase juts up from the floor here, 
weaving maliciously into the darkness. The uneven and jagged 
stairs are rough and crude, obviously crafted for optimal 
practicality rather than beauty. A thin yet revoltingly goopy 
slime seems to cling to certain steps, and it seems to thicken as 
the stairs approach the bottom floor. Dark granite walls envelop 
the staircase in all directions except to the south, and the 
cracked and jagged floor seems to have been worn, as if by the 
tread of many feet over long years.

A Large, Open Space in a Roughly Carved, Underworld Cavern~
   This portion of the cavern extends upward significantly, the 
ceiling becoming invisible within the oppressive darkness. A 
very faint sound of trickling water comes from the east, barely 
audible. The charred and blackened stone walls seem to yield to 
an intersection of some sort here, and the ground is relatively 
smooth. A door to the west hangs unevenly on its hinges, though 
it is padlocked and appears sturdy enough to make opening it by 
force difficult. It is fairly obvious that the floor here 
receives the grace of many footfalls, most of them likely 
belonging to foul creatures.

A Small Forge and Iron Foundry~
   Several anvils and other metallic and stone working tables can 
be found scattered throughout this cave. A huge furnace stands 
in its black grandeur in the back corner, emmitting immense 
amounts of suffocating heat. The air here is thick and moist, 
and the nauseating smell of orkish sweat permeates throughout the 
area. This cave seems to be a forge of some sort, though 
relatively small. The warm light of the furnace barely 
illuminates the gruff, newly-chiseled walls through the engulfing 
and dominating darkness.

An Ashy Portion of the Cavern Dominated by an Oversized Fire-pit~
   A gargantuan fire-pit opens up in the center of the cavern 
like a ravenous maw, the dominating feature of this room. Fueled 
by rotting wood and other unknown substances, the pit spews forth 
massive amounts of stifling heat and dense, grey ash. The air 
here is smothered with the suffocating ash, causing breathing to 
be difficult at best. Visibility is diminished also, as the ashy 
atmosphere coalesces with the oppressive darkness. The pit also 
emits a stench similar to that of burning flesh, hinting at the 
identity of some of the substances being consumed by its flames.

An Underground Spring of Murky Water~
   The ground cracks open briefly here, revealing a dank, 
trickling stream. The stream is flowing at a crawl, and seems to 
writhe and meander through the darkness with great effort. A 
thin film spreads across the surface of the water, and tints the 
water to an unpleasant greenish hue. Though the stream continues 
both northward and southward, it only proceeds through minute 
cracks in the northern and southern walls that no humanoid 
creature could ever pass through. The walls seem to contract 
here, as well as the ceiling, to form a small cave of rough, 
chiseled granite.

A Cavernous Tunnel Strewn with Pads of Fur and Rough Cloth~
   This tunnel is quite large, and the chipped and chiseled walls 
are distinctive hints that this passage was rather recently 
constructed. Large furs, the sources of which include a range of 
beasts large and small, lie strewn about in a careless and gruff 
fashion. The rocky walls jut out sharply in some areas, creating 
an unpleasant and perilous hazard. Specks and splashes of blood 
decorate the floor, some long dried and others quite fresh. The 
tunnel continues east and west with a branch to the south, and 
the air seems to thicken westward.

At the Opening of a Tunnel Leading Down~
   The tunnel here slopes steeply, descending into darkness to 
the south. The dark granite walls are mostly concealed by a 
layer of crude wooden boards, most of them on the verge of 
rotting. The ground is quite uneven, undulating in a random and 
perilous fashion. The planks seem to become more present, and 
conceal more of the sloppily-constructed walls as the tunnel 
leans downward, and faint yet shrieking cries of intense and 
painful agony occasionally pierce through the air from below.

A Rough Chamber Filled with Various Grim Trophies~
   This chamber is as gruesome as it is rough. The uneven walls 
and floor are profoundly ugly in their construction, though this 
chamber seems to take a perverse pleasure in the beauty of its 
grim coarseness. Several small holes were hastily dug into the 
walls, serving as a type of storage shelf. Revolting and heinous 
trophies of dismal origins lie stored within these holes, 
including dwarven scalps, elf ears, and other morbid trinkets 
from the bodies of men. An especially horrifying sight, the 
entire head of an elf, lies festering and rotting within one of 
the cubbie-holes, its sightless and empty eye-sockets glaring 
back into the abysmal darkness that inhabits this unholy shrine.

A Cavernous Tunnel Strewn with Pads of Fur and Rough Cloth~
   The tunnel widens and narrows arbitrarily as it proceeds along 
in an eastward and westward fashion. An alcove branches out to 
the south, with a sickening smell originating from that 
direction. Lying crumpled in heaps about the sides of this 
tunnel are the hides and fur of wolves, bears, wargs, and other 
creatures. A few scraps of ripped and torn cloth are also strewn 
about, as if this place was meant for some sort of derobing 
ritual, though the validity of this thought cannot be determined. 
The roughly-cut tunnel meanders on through the darkness, its dark 
basalt walls looming forebodingly on either side.

   This cave seems to be meant for slumber, though only foul 
creatures would rest in such disgusting filth. Bedding of some 
sort, primarily consisting of rough patches of straw and harsh, 
coarse cloth, dominates this place, where literally a hundred 
creatures could squeeze in their malicious bodies to rest in this 
fetid hole. A sickening stench can faintly be sensed coming from 
the north, and a tunnel of some sort is barely discernible to the 
east. Blood and other uneaten refuse from unknown animals can be 
viewed upon the floor, numerous insects and maggots feasting on 
the scraps in a grotesque and disturbing scene.

A Cluttered, Dilapidated Cave Decorated in a Tasteless Fashion~
   This cave is obviously the dwelling of some extremely foul and 
loathsome creatures. Uneaten remnants of maggot-infested animal 
parts lie strewn about this place. The cave itself is decorated, 
if one could call it that, in a series of uncomplimentary and 
randomly-coloured strands and ripped fragments of cloth, with a 
few straw piles constituting some type of bedding. Bones lie in 
a large pile in a corner, flies and other insects swarming about, 
attempting to salvage some sustenance from the abhorrent scraps. 
Though most of the bones seem to be of animal origin, several 
seemed to belong at one time to a humanoid creature of some sort. 
A wide tunnel recently cut out from the western wall leads 
onwards into another decrepit cavern.

A Grotesque Larder Stocked with the Flesh of Various Creatures~
   The smothering stench of rotting flesh and orc mingle in the 
moist warmth of this cramped chamber, the rancid smell sweetened 
only by a faint whiff of fresh blood. Roughly hewn shelves 
carved into the southern wall form a primitive larder of sorts, 
stocked with an abundance of meat in various stages of decay. 
Most of the carcasses are ambiguous in origin, though a few 
severed limbs appear distinctly humanoid. Scattered bones along 
with dirty straw coat the floor, halfway managing to conceal the 
grime-caked stone. 
   To the north a cavernous tunnel beckons, hopefully offering 
some measure of relief from the putrid miasma that resides here.

   This tunnel is wet, moist and very unpleasant. It is littered 
with refuse scraps of food, and in some places excrement of 
extremely foul and unsanitary creatures. Flies permeate 
throughout the air, and seem to envelop this place within a 
deafening, buzzing swarm. A repugnant and nauseating aroma reeks 
upward from below in strong, wispy currents, and seems to smell 
of rotting feces and other dirty, virulent substances. The 
tunnel continues southward, and also plunges downward into 
unspeakable depths, and rather disagreeable ones considering the 
repulsive stench that is emitted from its horrific bowels.

great numbers, and the carcasses of rats litter the rough, stone

   The utterly putrid air of this tightly-enclosed chamber is 
almost enough to knock someone unconscious upon entering. A deep 
cesspit takes up the majority of its floor, with only a narrow 
strip of solid ground circling its perimeter. The pool is filled 
with a viscous, rank-smelling liquid that lies completely 
motionless, its surface broken only by the occasional slow-rising 
bubble that bursts to release a cloud of sulphuric gas.

rotting, vertical planks of wood that rise up to meet the ceiling 
high above. The sound of muffled screams comes from behind a

At the Northern Gates of Minas Morgul~
   The gate is enormous. A kind of oily metal comprises its 
bones, the bars twisting and arching about in some ancient 
torment. A sculpture in the metal dominates the design, standing 
a foot or so above man height, and covered in loose flowing 
robes. The figure, seemingly reverent and pure, has been 
defaced, broken and torn, his arm shattered. The statue's face 
is so deformed that it looks as if he were stuck in an eternal 
state of pained torment. The metal of the bars is set in the 
dark stone, and the whole thing appears nigh impenetrable.

An Alley Piled High With Garbage and Rotting Refuse~
   Upon closer inspection, this portion of alley seems to have 
once been the remnants of a fortification that was roughly torn 
down. Towering mounds of trash rise to either side of the choked 
space, but foot traffic has worn an obvious path east to west, 
leading further into the shadowy recesses of the slums. Whatever 
purpose the structure may have once served has been long since 
lost to the ages, but now it serves as a suitable enough 
passageway for orkish feet.

   This large room has been designed as a guard barracks for the 
arena. It is a very unique guard barracks to Minas Morgul. All 
of the orcs and goblins serving as prison guards are actually 
adorned in a neat uniform sewn of coarse linen; here, especially, 
they don't want to be confused for one of the prisoners. The 
room itself is rather simple in nature. It is a large perfect 
cube, with two wide corridors heading away to the west and south. 
A miniature armory is arranged in the northeastern corner, and 
several rickety benches are sporadically arranged across the 
room.

An Armory with Shelves of Weapons Lining North and South Walls~
   This armory has been directly built into a wide corridor that 
connects to the guard barracks on one side, and a large waiting 
cell on the other. Occasionally, a group of guards would travel 
westward, dragging along with them some sort of unlucky new 
gladiator or beast. The more respected gladiators would be 
brought here from the holding cells so that they could pick out 
their own preferred weapon combinations, but, usually, the guards 
would just gather an armful of weapons, and throw them out into 
the arena. Two long shelves run along the northern and southern 
walls. They are covered not only with the more universal swords, 
axes, and spears, but also with various unusual weapons that are 
common only to a sport fight: tridents, nets, and sword-breakers.

At the Archway to Enter the Pit~
   A crossroads of sorts, this wide, dark hallway branches three 
ways. Cold, dark granite floors the way north and south, towards 
cells for the condemned combatants, each kept in painful 
anticipation for what very well be their last minutes alive. A 
wide ramp leads up to the east, sounds of unmerciful cheers and 
mayhem billowing down the expanse at gametimes, a near roar that 
enters the preparatory rooms of the arena, and seems to 
reverberate down the stonewalled hall. It stands agape like a 
giant horror's jaws, the only admittance to near certain death, 
and the gruesome horrors that await each person who travel 
through the gate's iron teeth.

overlook a rather large pit-fighting arena. The arena itself 
seems to be muddy and quite revolting, stained continually with 
spilled blood and other unpleasant bodily fluids. The seats 
themselves are not much better of a sight, being stained with 
unknown and probably unimaginable liquids. The cruel sounds and 
shouts of gambling seem to float through the air from the west. 
A blood-red curtain bars the passage northward, seeming to 
enclose a balcony of some sort.

The Bleedin' Fist Tavern~
   Built underneath the craggy lip of a cliff overhang, the 
ceiling of this large common room is composed of dark, mossy rock 
famous for its echoic qualities; shortly after the clamor of 
patrons reaches up past rotting wooden beams graced with crude 
carvings into the cavernous, vaulted stone overhead, it returns 
to the sawdust-covered, beaten earth underfoot in a harsh murmur. 
Noticeably dark, a few small torches carelessly affixed to rough 
wooden walls with iron bands and tiny, wayward shafts of sunlight 
that encroach under and through the oft-repaired door to the 
north are the only sources of light in this room. A great slab 
of stone stretches out before the eastern wall, rows of shelves 
behind it carrying a multitude of clay bottles. The tavern is 
mostly deserted at this time, only a few small groups of 
dark-skinned humans gathering in a corner, and the rare orc or 
goblin that has braved the daylight.

Seated at a crowd of uneven, stained wooden tables is a
small gathering of orcs and goblins, barely enough to fill a table or two.

walls~
   Hewn from rough, ancient wood, these walls seem sturdy and
do more than the room's beams to support the rocky ceiling 
overhead. Moss has begun to creep along the top edges of the
wood where it meets the ceiling, staining the already poorly
finished walls with a grimy patina. As the wall's surface
moves closer to the floor, the frequency of the mass of
roughly-carved drawings and words upon it increases.

heavy, prone to slamming.

A Ramshackle Kitchen~
   This whole kitchen seems a frenzied disorganized mess. 
Various stoves and wood burning fireplaces have been set up here 
to cook up plates of food. Food stains the floor in many places 
as pieces of this or that have been left lying out to be prepared 
to cook. Occasional flies lucky enough to get through the doors 
begin to gather in places while strips of honey hang from the 
walls to collect them.

   Cruel iron hooks hang from the cavernous ceiling of this cool

floor is somewhat bloodied, the corpses having dripped down to 
stain the stone floor. A single table is set up in the center of 
the room where the corpses are butchered and prepared to be 
cooked for the kitchen.

A Somewhat Tidy Floproom~
   Built deeply into a cave wall, this fair sized sleeping 
chamber is kept fairly clean, though bits of trash still spring 
up in places. Designed to hold as many people as possible 
stretched out across the floor it is difficult to thread a path 
through this room without standing upon someones bedding. This 
chamber still remains somewhat cool, likely from avoiding the sun 
at all times of day. The floor is carved out of sanded down 
stone, to the point that though unyielding, it is smooth in most 
places.

A Small, Stone-Walled, Windowless Building~
   This small, cramped building seems to be compressing on all 
four sides, causing an immense feeling of suffocation. The 
cruel, pale stone walls of this place are darkened and stained 
with unkown and most likely quite revolting substances. The 
floor is scratched and scarred with heavy and continual usage, 
and the darkness of this sinister site is intensified by the 
blatant lack of any windows or other connections to the outside. 
The building continues onward to the west, while the only exit 
from this structure lies in the form of a door southward.

A Stairwell Leading Into an Underground Basement~
   The building's westward segment resides here, and a large 
stairway opens up in the form of a wide crevice in the cracked, 
stone floor. The stairwell seems to lead to an underground 
basement of some sort, and the smooth, rounded steps indicate 
that it is tread upon fairly regularly. Soft, yet distinct 
muffled sounds escape from the cellar, and they appear to be the 
cruel, abrasive speech of evil and foul creatures. The ground 
here is stained with what appeared to be old, fetid blood, as if 
an injured creature passed onward down the stairs.

   A cold chill rushes down this long, stone hallway. Heavy, 
reinforced wooden doors stand to the north and south. The carved 
stone underfoot is littered by puddles and other moisture. The 
occasional dried blood spot can be seen on the walls and floors, 
and the sounds of cries of fear and anguish echo off the walls. 
Each door shuts with a resounding click. 
   Heavy doors stand to the north and south, while the hallway 
continues west. To the east, a heavy wool curtain lies.

   While mildly spotless, this room seems rather cramped. There 
is very little space to mill about this area. A desk sits near 
the center of the room, taking up a good portion of the area. 
Parchments and lists hang on the nearby walls, neatly arranged 
while piles of the same charts sit upon the desk. This office 
seems to be enough to accomadate one's needs, with enough room 
for a few guests to stop in.

northern wall, while shelves seem to line every wall. A large 
table also stands near the center of the room, covered in 
different supply needs. This room has a very dark and dusky feel 
to it, making it a rather uncomfortable place to stay for long 
time periods. The orc supplier can be seen moving around, 
seemingly adapt to the environment they work in.

rather general common area, as orcs of all shape and size can be 
seen milling about. The shaped stone walls are rather rough to 
the touch, showing their sturdy nature.

A Long, Dungeon Hallway Filled with Rooms and Cells~
   The echo of anguished screams and moans bounces off the carved 
stone walls of this long hallway. The resounding click of the 
nearby doors also appeals to the forboding environment that 
exists here. Puddles of water can be seen on a good portion of 
the stone walkway underneath. Occasionally, a blood stain is 
seen on the floor and walls, and even the ceiling. A very musty 
scent floats upon the air, almost enough to choke upon if not 
adapt to it. 
   To the north and south stand reinforced wooden doors. The 
scent of burnt meat and rotted vegetables floats in from the 
north, adding to the stink.

A Long, Dungeon Hallway Filled with Rooms and Cells~
   Blocks of cold, dark granite form the walls of this hallway, 
which echoes with the guttural sounds of unknown foul beasts. 
Lit by the occasional pitch-smeared torch, the majority of the 
hall lays in darkness, leaving the shadows to be home for the 
unseen. Straw, rotten and moldy, lays scattered over the 
trampled dirt floor. The dismal hallway continues further 
northward, but ends here in front of a heavy iron gate. There 
are solidly reinforced doors secured on either side of the hall.

   Cramped and smelling of a mixture of blood and sweat, this 
chamber is lit by several sputtering torches held to the walls 
with black iron brackets. The cold granite walls seem to close 
in upon those who wait here, feeding on what fear they can pull 
from their tortured spirits. Firmly-packed dirt makes up the 
floor, littered with bits of trash and scattered deposits of dung 
from some manner of fell beast. A large iron gate is set into 
the northern wall, while a worn but sturdy ramp leads up to a 
large trapdoor.

sinewy silk strands attach across the width, set traps preapared 
for its unwary dinner guests. Multilated torsos and other 
numerous body parts are spun in the gossamer threads, horrified 
expressions found on half-eaten faces. A dripping sound can be 
heard somewhere in the laybrinth of webs, its source hidden by 
corpses.

that makes up the walls has been reinforced with iron plates, 
holding in a creature with an unmistakable rage. The 'troll 
room' as it is called in almost every single one of Minas 
Morgul's languages, is littered with large pieces of rubble, each 
one small in comparison to the enormity of the cell. Large 
cracks rip open the floor, most likely made by the huge creature 
that calls it home.

cell's secrets well hidden in lurid blackness. White bones are 
scattered across the bleak stones, the form they once held while 
alive scarred and twisted, each piece stripped of any flesh. A 
perverted stench hangs thickly in the stagnant air, a mixture of 
rot and filth, giving evidence to what eats here, lives here.

the stones themselves. Huge iron manacles have been bolted to 
the walls and floors, chaining the large creature kept in here to 
a small area, allowing little movement. A large iron door leads 
out into the halls, visited very few times to feed and water the 
condemned.

the walls keep hurling various unsavory articles of food upon the 
contestants in the pit. Orcs and humans, as well as various 
terrifying beasts trample through the pit, attacking each other 
with fists, teeth, and weapons, and spraying the audience with 
searing, dark-red blood. Various body parts, with a fresh scent 
still about them, litter the corner of the arena.

ground here is littered with broken weapon and armour fragments, 
many of them hazardously protruding from the ground in a most 
dangerous manner. The air here is moist and thick, as if 
permeated with the salty sweat of the combatants.

sanded, preventing any attempts to escape the arena. Several 
wide, greased stone columns tower around the perimeter of the 
pit, allowing the searing flames at their pinnacles to alight the 
blood-stained sands. The metallic chimes of weapon hitting upon 
weapon intermingle with the agonizing screams accompanying the 
hacking and dismemberment of the contestants' flesh. The viewers 
sitting at the bleachers are armed with various disfigured 
articles of food, as well as the occasional weapon; they 
repeatedly pelt the gladiators, attempting to influence the fight 
in some manner or other.

Northeastern Corner of the Arena~
   The northeastern part of the arena seems to be the most 
blood-soaked, if that is possible. The muddy and dirty ground is 
neither brown, nor black, but instead a dark, rich blood-red. 
The stench of sweat, grime and other unpleasant bodily fluids 
sifts through the air in horrid, potent streams. Along with the 
smell, the curses and screams of angry spectators urge on whoever 
they have bet upon. The ground is so wet here that an almost 
quicksand like effect has been achieved - it would be wise not to 
stand too long in one place.

Northwestern Corner of the Arena~
   This whole area is covered with a coarse rust colored dirt.
It is very trampled, probably from the people and creatures
fighting for their lives.  Many a soul has fallen in this arena,
all for the entertainment of the bloodthirsty denizens of Mordor.
They rise to their feet, bets and excitement the only thing on 
their minds.  The walls are made of a very thick granite - 
scratched, bloodstained, and beaten so much that it is chipped
and nearly falling.  Stands exist above the arena, where the
sadists of Mordor can enjoy their bloodlust in relative safety.
The arena continues east and south of here for quite some
distance.

Arena Seating near a Large Betting Area~
   This section of the arena seating is very near to a large 
gambling area. The loud, obnoxious sounds of yells and shouts of 
bets and cancellations, minor arguments and full-fledged brawls 
can be made out from the mass of people attempting to double or 
triple their money. The action in the arena is quite downplayed 
and droned out by this seemingly violent, yet almost ritualistic 
spectacle. A large balcony can be seen jutting out to the 
northeast, though it seems to be for the use of the powerful and 
important only.

sounds of skirmish and battle rise up as the deafening noise of 
the crowd surges and swells like a great ocean tide. The

point not being easily discernable. A large red curtain 
delineates the southern origins of this place, and serves as a

   The pathway proceeds on to the north and south, but is 
extremely narrow here. The massive noise of the crowd is 
oppressive and deafening, and almost seems to be attacking the 
spectators that create it. The madness and violent tension in 
the air creates a pensive mood in this place, and the sighs and 
grunts of injured, wounded, and dying fighters permeate throughout 
the arena. The entrance to the Witchking's Arena can be seen 
clearly to the north, as it is quite a gargantuan gate.

A Long Stone Hallway~
   The heavy stone walls of this massive corridor gradually curve 
inwards into a smooth arch, forming the ceiling above. The walls 
are mold-covered and slimy, a result of the very damp and musty 
atmosphere. The only representative of the poorly-designed 
ventilation system is a small air duct on the eastern wall, just 
above arm's reach, and it has been wedged with the remains of 
some broken spear. The corridor widens to the south, while to 
the north it enters the barracks of the pit guards.

A Long Stone Hallway~
   This hallway connects an enormous archway to a holding cell. 
The smooth granite walls lean slightly inward, as they approach 
the rough ceiling covered by innumerable spider webs. The shape 
of the corridor creates a false illusion of height in anyone 
walking through towards the archway leading into the arena 
entrance. The floor on the eastern side of the hallway, where 
the winning gladiators leaving the arena walk, is covered with a 
fine layer of blood; on the western side, the floor is layered 
with excrement.

A Large Chamber with a Disturbing Stench~
   A heavy smell of orc sweat lingers over this hot chamber. 
Rows of nests and blankets have been tossed about in a careless 
fashion littering the floor with various piles of trash, many of 
the pallets occupied by the sleeping forms of scarred ork-kin. 
The rancid stench wafts upwards, trapped by the rock ceiling set 
high above in this underground cave, the stone walls roughly 
hewn, the floor packed dirt. Four crudely-built tunnels lead off 
from this central chamber, the northern passage covered by a 
large door of huge wooden planks, an intricately carved emblem of 
an eyeless socket upon it.

A Hollow, Recently Dug Chamber~
   This chamber appears to have been carved recently from the 
thick, surrounding rock. A heavy stench of orc lingers over the 
place that would offend any creature of a daintier taste. 
Tattered banners bearing poorly sewn skulls hang from the walls, 
while at the back of the room stands a dais of sorts, upon which 
sits a crude throne carved of rotting wood. Piled beneath the 
throne lie human skulls in a path leading out of the room, some 
still fresh with blood, or gore that has yet to have been licked 
away by a passing orc.

difficulty, this street sees much less traffic than the rest of 
the slums, but is far from abandoned. It has long since fallen 
into disrepair, cobblestones underfoot crumbling into gravel and 
dirt. The ancient, wooden buildings lining either side of the 
path are riddled with decay and rot.

The canyon is dark and shadow filled, receving very little direct 
sunlight. Moving through the canyon is made difficult by the 
jumble of huge, square, basalt boulders which litter the floor. 
The canyon continues to the south. A large, stone door, slightly 
lighter in color than the surrounding rock, leads directly into 
the cliff-face to the east.

with a stout door made from oak timbers, and to the west with

In the center of the chamber is a smoldering fire within a rough 
ring of stones, which fills the room with eye-stinging smoke. 
Another stench, like musk and coal, also fills the room.

A Shadowy Intersection Before a Bridge~
   This poorly-maintained road, once known as Lond Nirnaeth to 
the men of Gondor, finally comes to an end here here as it 
crosses a stone bridge before the gates of Minas Morgul to the 
south. The sickly waters of the River Morgulduin rush by from 
the northeast to the west, passing under the bridge. To the 
north, a deep and narrow ravine cuts into the heart of the 
sheer-faced mountains.

Upon a Wide, Stone Bridge~
   Over the pale, yellow-green waters of the River Morgulduin 
this wide bridge spans. It arches very slightly, and is pieced 
together of relatively smooth stone. The stones, once a light 
grey hue, are now dirtied with blotches of brown and black over 
the surface. Immediately to the south rise the malefic, spired 
gates that guard the main entrance into the city of Minas Morgul, 
while to the north lies a barren valley cutting through the 
mountains.

Before the Great Gates of Minas Morgul~
   The great barbican and gates of Minas Morgul rise up sharply 
to the south, stretching across a break in the mountains. 
Figures can be seen moving amongst the shadowed turrets as they 
keep watch over a bridge to the north and a winding path to the 
south. The path leads down towards city itself, which rises up 
behind massive basalt walls, its great central spire a mockery of 
the shining white tower of Minas Tirith. 
   Mounted on either side of the gates here are a pair of 
ancient, stone statues that have long since been defaced and 
broken. The chiseled faces have been deformed past recognition, 
and the once-white stone pitted and stained to a mottled grey 
hue.

A Deep Ravine~
   A narrow, V-shaped ravine scrambles northeast into the 
heartless mountains which border the Morgul Vale. The ground is 
littered with sharp shards of obsidian, and black basaltic 
rubble. The ravine spills out into the broader valley of the 
Morgul Vale to the south.

Under the Heavy, Black Gates of Minas Morgul~
   Heavy reinforced arches of dark stone form a high, wide 
ceiling above the passage through the gates into the vale of 
Morgul. A thick, iron banded door leads west into a sort of 
guard station bearing an archery slit in the wall for bows and 
crossbows to be aimed into the courtyard. The path inside is 
made of cool cobbled stone that is now mucked and covered with 
dirt and mud in places from the passing of so many feet making 
the passageway somewhat more slick and treacherous. A faint 
layer of ash also covers the walls and open ground. 
   To the south is another doorway which leads deeper into the 
halls of Azun Keep, the Gate to Morgul.

A Rough, Stone Guardtower~
   Thick, black stone walls climb into a spiraling staircase 
within this small guard tower. At the base of the tower is an 
old bench far from its better days, made out of some dark wood. 
A crossbow slit in the north yard allows for any sentry here to 
keep a watchful eye of those who come and go. A banner bearing a 
silver moon on navy blue hangs in one corner alongside of a 
ragged banner of black bearing a single red eye.

The Great Hall of Azun Keep Near a Small Hardwood Door~
   A small hardwood door directly to the north defends the 
entrance into Azun Keep. In contrast with the heavy stone wall, 
the door seems somewhat unremarkable, and prone to attack. To 
the credit of the ancient architects who designed this fortress, 
the path through the wall, on the other side of the door, 
inclines at a downward angle, and then curves somewhat to the 
south, creating a passage too twisted and impassable for any 
conventional battering ram. Several round holes are scattered 
throughout the door, allowing defenders to attack any enemies on 
the other side with pikes. The rest of the Great Hall is 
somewhat visible through the sooty haze to the south.

The Great Hall of Azun Keep~
   The two enormous slabs of grey stone come together into a 
sharp corner. The wall to the north is slightly tilted inwards 
and sports a whole assortment of wedge-shaped arrow slits. The 
walls are generally smooth to the touch, being covered by a layer 
of ancient black mildew. The mildew is apparently extremely 
toxic, as, in the corner, there are several rotting corpses of 
very thin goblins with the black mildew growing around the mouth 
area.

goblins~
The corpses of these goblins lie curled up on the floor next
to the walls, below large patches of a thick black mildew.
They are in various states of decay, some being little more
than collections of bones picked clean, and others still
bearing recognizable facial features. Among the least-decayed
bodies, the gaunt faces are twisted into masks of agony, with
a heavy black mildew growing around the mouths. Rat droppings
litter the ground around and among the bodies, but the bodies
themselves are strangely untouched, no bite-marks visible on
the flesh stretched tight over their protruding bones.
~
E
mildew~
The mildew that covers these walls is very thick, the normally
circular patches giving way to a clinging mass which blankets
the walls, covering any gaps in the grey stone. It is black in
colour, dark against the lighter-coloured stone walls, with the
occasional small white splotches adding contrast. The air is
thick where the mildew grows the most dense, a heavy, acrid
stench assailing the nostrils.

The Great Hall of Azun Keep~
   The thick grey stone wall of Azun Keep skirts the room here to 
the east and to the north. It slants slightly inwards on the 
north side of the Keep, following an ancient fortress design that 
supposedly makes the wall near impregnable to heavy bombardment. 
The walls, the floor, and the insides of the scattered arrow 
slits, are covered with age-old mold and muck, leaving the entire 
keep dark and grimy. 
   A set of dank, stone stairs wind downward here, leading 
underground beneath the gatekeep.

The Center of the Great Hall~
   The Great Hall of the Keep expands in all cardinal directions 
here. To the north, a small reinforced hardwood door leads 
outside of the fortifications of the keep, while at the end of 
the hall to the south, a reinforced portcullis leads inside the 
city. Several white marble columns carved in a classic style 
reminiscent of that of the early Far Haradrim help support the 
stone ceiling above. An unpleasant odor emanates from somewhere 
to the southwest.

The Great Hall of Azun Keep~
   To the east, a heavy, grime-covered dark grey stone wall 
provides the external support for Azun Keep. The wall has been 
designed wide enough so as to be able to withstand the volleys of 
some of the larger catapults; a large orc would be able to lie 
down lengthwise into any of the wedge-shaped arrow slits 
scattered at regular intervals along the massive stone structure. 
The usual dirt-covered state of the Keep's hall is even thicker 
here, the packed soil deliberately laid for this recently 
converted section of the building. Under the careful scrutiny of 
crest-helmed Black Watch and slit-visored Uruk-Hai training 
between many different components of the Witchking's Horde takes 
place, both spars and other training of the militant bent.

The Great Hall of Azun Keep~
   The western wall of the Great Hall looms to the west. This 
portion of the hall appears to have once been a makeshift mess 
hall. Large pieces of stone and wood that once used to be tables 
and benches, and are now too large to remove by means of either 
of the two small doors, are scattered around the area. A small 
fireplace has been built into the wall to the south. A clay pipe 
with a large funnel hangs over the fireplace, sending the smoke 
outside of the Great Hall. Directly west of the fireplace, there 
hangs a tattered rag resembling a tapestry.

A large woolen article that once used to be a tapestry hangs
upon the wall.  While it used to cover most of this entire section
of the wall, it appears that every so often, over the course of its
multi-centennial life, someone walked by, and detached a piece from
the bottom of the tapestry.  Currently, the only parts remaining
are those that are just above a taller man's arm-reach.  Most of
the colors have been faded, or eaten away by moths.  From a
distance, one can merely see the resemblance of a yellow sun in
the upper right hand corner.

The Great Hall of Azun Keep Near a Rough Stair~
   The floor of the Great Hall here has been entirely hewn apart, 
leaving a small, narrow, irregular staircase that leads down into 
a dank cavern below. The wall is basically intact, but it is 
visible where its foundations have been destroyed; the cavern 
below cuts away to the south. The staircase is very slimy, and 
most of the orcs and goblins that climb or descend it tend to use 
their hands for support.

   Much stonework has gone into the creation of this great hall. 
Several white pillars have been erected to support the huge stone 
ceiling far above. A putrid smell floats in the air, and seems 
to be drifting from the east. To the northeast is a spiral 
staircase that leads upwards. To the west, a small hole in the 
floor reveals a dangerous staircase lowering into a dark cavern. 
   A large archway leads into the city to the south.

The Great Hall of Azun Keep near a Spiral Stair~
   The large grey walls come together from the east and south 
into a lighter-colored, worn cornerstone. The entire corner is 
particularly putrid and unsanitary, as a large pile of garbage 
and refuse has been mashed beneath a narrow, rusted-iron, spiral 
staircase. A thick cloud of large, wicked flies circles around 
the staircase, ready to defend its prize against any competition. 
Occasionally, some starved goblin or orc would attempt to catch 
some flies to supplement his or her supper.

 two humans to walk abreast, and even then only if they are of slight build. In 
sharp contrast to the dark-red rust which coats the railings and supports along 
the sides of the staircase, the stairs themselves are smooth and shiny, a testam
ent to heavy and frequent use.

   A solid, black stone archway looms overhead at a height great 
enough for the tallest of trolls to pass through. A series of 
stairs leads north, deeper into the gate fortress while a simple, 
unadorned door lies to the west. A heavy iron gate bars further 
passage south of here, clearly meant to keep those who do not 
belong inside out. Faces carved from beautiful white stone are 
now stained black from soot as numerous torch holders have been 
erected here in order to keep this part of the fortress lit at 
all times of the day.

Many of these faces bear likeness to benevolent or stern old men, their countena

portions of any given face, a result of the many torches which have been install

and scratches on the white stone, a testament to the destructiveness of the orc-

A Cramped War-Room with a Musky Stench~
   Torn maps of the Gondor region hang from the walls of this war 
room detailing with pins the location of Orc and Haradrim 
soldiers. A large table stands in the middle of this dusty, 
poorly-lit room allowing for a council of war to gather in times 
of emergency. The walls of this room are made out of somewhat 
dark, well-carved stone. Yet over time even the finest 
stone-work begins to mold slightly if not taken care of, which 
happens to be the case here as creeping patches of dark green 
have begun to collect on the walls.

   This large stone chamber reverberates with a nightmarish 
cacophony of snarls, grunts, screams and groans. The darkened 
stone floor, its blocks so covered with filth as to be nearly 
indistinguishable from dirt, is weathered and stained with age. 
A high ceiling and a few barred windows do very little to 
disperse the lingering stench that infects the area, and the air 
is damp and humid with things best left unnamed. 
   A massive door of iron-bound wood has been set firmly into the 
western wall, while to the east a wide hall opens up.

Slave Road West of an Intersection, North of a Brewery~
   Slave Road stretches out to the west, a hard-packed dirt road 
scored with numerous wagon ruts of varying sizes running parallel 
to a wooden wall that stands to the north. To the east is the 
crowded Arena Road and the looming form of Morgul Tower. The 
two-story wooden building to the south houses a brewery, the 
sturdy oaken door often left welcomingly open to customers. The 
constant sounds of shouting, wheels creaking, and chains rattling 
fill the air, pierced by the periodic crack of a whip as slave 
drivers transport their chattel along the road.

   Wide enough for two full-sized wagons to pass through side by 
side, the gate set along the northern wall of this yard opens out 
onto Slave Road to the north. Enclosing this area is a high,

amidst much shouting and noise. A lumbermill is visible to the 
south, while the wagonyard itself continues westward.

A Slave Holding-Pen~
   The ground underfoot is muddy and covered in a layer of trash, 
though the majority of which has been shoved into small piles in 
each of this pen's corners. A crude fence marks the perimeter of 
the pen, built from several lengths of crooked logs laid out 
horizontally and nailed to squat, wooden posts spaced out at 
periods. The western end contains a stone trough, filled with 
murky water.

Slave Road Passing Through Rows of Tents and Caravans~
   Slave Road stretches out to the east and west, a hard-packed 
dirt road scored with numerous wagon ruts of varying sizes 
running parallel to a wooden wall that stands to the north. Some 
caravans are stationed alongside the road, a number of tents and 
pavilions set up between them. Slavers mill about, catching some 
rest beside a campfire, or going about their business between 
raiding expeditions. The road itself continues to bustle with 
activity, though moreso at night than during the day. To the 
north, a small alley filled with rotting buildings stands, a 
stream of ragclad humans moving in and out of it.

A Split on Slave Road~
   A wide fork splits the road here, heading northward along the 
wall of a large stone building to the northeast, and southward 
towards a gate in the Arena. In addition, a narrower, less 
inviting road appears to head westwards. The constant sounds of 
shouting, wheels creaking, and chains rattling fill the air, 
pierced by the periodic crack of a whip as slave drivers 
transport their chattel along the road. Piled up against the 
building is a sizeable mound of refuse, attracting swarms of 
black, flying insects, and giving this place an unsavory and
unpalatable character.

Slave Road Running Along a Wall~
   Turning to the south and west, this hard-packed dirt road is 
cut with deep wagon ruts. A tall, wooden wall to the north runs 
parallel to the road, made of thick logs lashed together by rope. 
Eastward lies a sprawl of tents and caravans, among which many 
figures can be seen milling about. Giving this road its name is 
the steady traffic of slaves, both human and goblin, being driven 
along in either direction.

enclosing the city and its buildings, while the Ephel Duath's 
jagged stone peaks are visible beyond its top. Northward is a 
wooden palisade that runs parallel to the road, made of logs 
lashed together and coated with pitch. To the south, a large 
iron door bars entrance and exit from a blocky, two-storied 
building. Slavers drive their chattel along this road and in and

   The ground here is softer, dirt and mud churned up to make for 
an uneven surface upon this path. Rearing up to the south is the 
gargantuan form of the Witchking's Arena, dominating the view in 
that direction. Slaves condemned to fighting for their lives in 
the arena are driven southward along the path. Bones and other 
refuse lie scattered along the sides of the road, while a wooden 
fence surrounds a wagonyard to the east.

Large Entry Foyer Of The Slave Halls~
Burly slavers move about this large room throughout the day 
and night, more often than not dragging along a wretched human or 
occasional goblin slave by a length of chain. The stone walls of 
the foyer are marked with numerous streaks and splotches of dark 
stains, and the panelled floor is covered in a fine layer of dirt 
and grit. The scent of sweat and blood hangs heavy in the air, 
and the noise of slavers shouting and abusing their chattel 
reverberates loudly across the foyer. A small area in the 
north-east corner of the hall is somewhat cleaner, and holds host 
to a number of tables, the rest of the room otherwise devoid of 
furniture. A small, yet heavy door is set in the northern wall, 
while a larger pair of two doors opens outwards onto Malle 
Adunakhor to the south.

The Slave Halls~
   The angry shouts of slavers fills the air of this large stone 
room, mingled with the whimpers and occasional scream of the 
gaunt slaves, as they are hauled from the large trapdoor that 
occupies the center of the area to the small, secured door that 
lies in the southern wall. A number of crude tables occupy the 
edges of the room, occupied by the few Slavers not busy 
conditioning slaves. Black soil litters the stone floor, the 
greatest concentration leading from the trapdoor to the southern 
door. The ceiling is rather high, and a rickety wooden staircase 
set near the door ascends upward to the second level of the Slave 
Halls.

Dismal Underground Chamber Lined With Cages~
   Hacked directly from the dirt, thick wooden beams ring the 
perimeter of this underground chamber, branching out to support 
the earthen ceiling, from which pale, warped roots dangle down. 
Numerous cages, formed from thick, soot-blackened iron bars, 
occupies much of this area, close-pressed goblin and human 
visible behind them. At the northern side of the chamber a broad 
staircase leads up to a large trapdoor set in the ceiling, while 
the center of this room is occupied by a firepit dug into the 
ground, a number of manacled slaves busy at work cooking coarse 
meals under the watch of muscular Slavers. The fire of the 
roasting illuminates the area in a dismal gloom, through which 
armored men and women shove near-naked slaves between the cages 
and the trapdoor.

Crowded Iron-Barred Cage~
   Numerous, near-naked humans sit huddled upon the floor of this 
large cage, various expressions of terror etched across their 
sweat drenched faces. Thick, immovable iron bars form the 
confines of this dark, dank cage, the faltering light filtering 
through from the south providing only enough illumination to 
distinguish shapes in the gloom. Whimpers, moans, groans and 
screams sound forth, not only from the wretched men and women 
gathered in the cage, but from beyond the heavy cage-door set in 
the south of the cage.

An Oppressive Tanning Chamber~
   The initial rush of heat and fumes from opening the door and 
entering this room comes as almost a physical blow. Two large 
tanning vats take up most of the floorspace, each about six feet 
square and containing a multitude of noxious chemicals used for 
the treating of hides. A squat, wooden workbench stretches 
across the southern wall, containing tools for working with the 
treated leather. The room is windowless, but a grate set in the 
stone ceiling allows for some ventilation.

Minas Morgul Labor Masonry~
   This squat, squarish building is constructed of thick, 
blackened stone, making the walls rough to the touch. No windows 
allow light in, and the shop is dimly lit by a single, rusting 
lantern hung from the ceiling. The floor is packed dirt, mostly 
covered with a ratty, flea-ridden pelt that could possibly serve 
as a rug. A squat doorway leads out to a yard filled with orkish 
screeches and shouts.

The Entry Hall to a Large Warehouse~
   This dark hallway opens up the rest of the way deeper into 
this massive warehouse. Sturdy wooden walls block all light that 
would reach into the room from outside and the halls are hung 
with oddly designed black banners. At the center of the room 
stands a crudely carved statue of a man or orc that has been worn 
down over time, his hand clutching a broadsword while his other 
hand holds aloft the head of a decapitated foe. In this low 
light the mans worn down and broken features are cast in a dreary 
light. A heavy, wooden door stands to the east, blocking 
further passage while the slight smell of hay lingers to the 
north.

A Small, Barn-Like Stable~
   Unusual for a stable, this room contains only one stall and a 
small hayloft. The smell of hay and horse dung clings to the air 
here as if this place were part of a farm. This barn isnt 
actually a part of the rest of the warehouse, but is actually a 
small shed attached to its side. A small area of the loft holds 
bedding and assorted bits of trash making it clear that horses 
are not the only ones to live in this stable.

of the larger rooms in this warehouse it acts as a testimony of 
the oddness of this clan and their wealth to be able to afford 
such good sleeping conditions. Black banners hang from the walls 
of this dimly lit room at odd intervals showing a helmed feature 
clutching a severed head in one hand while his other holds a 
massive sword.

A Close-Walled, Kitchen Alcove~
   This close-walled kitchen alcove is carved neatly out of 
curving stone. A near mastery in work it is oddly out of place 
in this part of the city which tends to prefer the rougher, more 
poorly crafted side of the spectrum, and rarely is there anything 
that could be considered on the boundary of artistic such as 
this. Rows of cupboards line the walls filled with various 
ingredients used in cooking. Fire pits are built into the neatly 
carved stone stoves and a smooth plate of stone lies partway 
across the top acting as a burner.

stacked high with old books and dusty old relics. Meticulously 
clean outside of the heavy dust, a bed sits against the side of

have been raided and torn apart a long time ago, and the 
artifacts sold or melted down for what profit could be had.

   Large iron gates are set on massive hinges set into a

from deep within the cave system that stretches southwards, as 
well as from the Foundry to the north. Orcs wander about here 
and make frequent trips back and forth. The darkness southwards 
is broken up by the occasional huge bundle of oily torches, 
casting smoke and the smells of animal fat throughout this place.

   Dirty, grimy, and caked with soot, this tunnel is barely kept 
in a respectable state, given the number of orcs, goblins, and 
various other darker races that traverse it. At any given hour, 
at least a dozen can be seen along its stretch, moving about on 
their daily routine and scarcely loitering. On the northern side 
of the tunnel, a stone door stands open on poorly-constructed 
hinges.

The End of a Wide, Soot-Covered Tunnel~
   Continually traversed by the darker races, this expansive 
tunnel rarely has anyone loitering along its length. Apparently 
constructed in haste or simply incompetence, the tunnel abruptly 
stops to the east, though it seems it was half-dug-out, as if 
abandoned in a hurry. At the northern most edge of the tunnel, a 
large stone door hangs open, and on the southern edge, a number 
of smaller caves are crammed together.

Branch off a Wide, Soot-Covered Road~
   Joining together here are two cobblestone roads, one 
stretching east and west between a pair of gates at either end of 
the sector, while snaking along northward is another road, this 
one in a much worse state of disrepair. Sprigs of weeds sprout 
from the ground, and off to the east many loud bangs and clangs 
pierce the air. Though both roads are well-travelled, the 
east-and-west course is a good deal more populated, as small 
throngs of orcs move along it.

buildings of this sector of Minas Morgul. A constant commotion 
is audible at any given hour, the dark races of men shouting, 
orcs and goblins arguing and chattering, and above all else, a 
number of rhythmic clanging, banging, and clinking sounds 
resonate from the massive building lining the northern edge of 
the road.

   Save for the sky at times, the only colors comprising this 
rather unscenic route's view are the grey of the cobblestones and 
the black of the mounds of soot upon them. Frequently tread 
upon, the stones on this road's surface are old and cracked, 
weeds sprouting from gaps between them in many places. Blocking 
movement to the north is a stocky and very long building, which 
stretches along to the east and west. Along the southern edge of 
the road are a number of stone dwellings, little or no space 
between them.

A Soot-Covered Road South of an Immense Building~
   Ash and soot have been caked onto the dull cobblestones of 
this fairly well-maintained, if dirty road that stretches to the 
east and west. All along the southern edge, several squat, 
stonework buildings are jammed in tightly alongside one another. 
A single, massive building stretches to the north and west, a 
wide pair of doors allowing entrance here. A chimney extends 
from its roof and at all times, day or night, billowing tufts of 
smoke waft out from it.

A Roughly-Cobbled Path~
   Though it's still traversable, this branch off the main road 
to the south seems to have seen much better days. Regardless of 
the weather, the view from this path always consists of the 
bleak, dreary greys and blacks of Minas Morgul. Consistent 
throughout the area are the squat, ramshackle stone buildings all 
along the sides of the roads, though to the east lies a mammoth 
building, a gate upon its wall. The path continues northward to 
a curve and southward, where it rejoins with the main road. A 
trail of carriages moves in and out through the area, leading 
from the eastern gate out onto the larger, southern road.

Bend in a Roughly-Cobbled Path~
   Here, the rough and sometimes upturned cobblestones of the 
path curve both east and south, snaking their way along the rows 
of ramshackle houses, all seemingly the same design over and over 
along the eges of the street. To the north stands one of many 
stocky, stone buildings, and the street continues its course 
south and east.

A Roughly-Cobbled Path~
   Considering the small amount of traffic visible on this path, 
the cause of its state of disrepair is an obvious neglect to it. 
Upturned and cracked cobblestones abound all along its length, 
and sprigs of weeds sprout through the furrows between the 
stones. Along the northern edge of the street sits a row of 
slave quarters, all extremely similar: short, squat, made of stone, 
and decrepit. Blocking egress to the south is an immense stone 
building, the chimney perched atop its roof continually billowing 
out smoke.

Bend in a Roughly-Cobbled Path Along Rows of Slave Housing~
   Here, the trail's progress is impeded to the south by a short, 
sprawling stonework building; atop its roof sprouts a massive 
chimney, billowing tufts of smoke wafting from it at any given 
time. Echoes of the clangs of metal-on-metal resound from 
within. To the east, the road meets a row of ramshackle, 
run-down slave quarters, indiscernable from one another. The 
path's course continues northward and eastward, snaking through 
even more rows of slave quarter.

A Roughly-Cobbled Path Along Rows of Slave Housing~
   This path's rough, grime-covered and aged cobblestones stretch 
along both north, where it meets its end at a towering dark wall, 
and south, where its course is interrupted by a squat building of 
grey stone some distance away, and is forced to take a sharp turn 
to the west. For all the endless rows of slave quarter, there 
are hardly ever more than a bare few souls in sight. Those few 
that do pass through, however, are dressed in the most 
rudimentary and crude of garb, even for the dark races of Minas 
Morgul.

A Roughly-Cobbled Path Along Rows of Slave Housing~
   Coming to an abrupt halt at a towering blackened wall, this 
run-down road passes through rows and rows of similarly short, 
squat stone buildings, most of which have seen much better days. 
Scarcely populated and even more scarcely traversed, the road is 
empty more often than not, and a general silence prevails save 
for the repeated, rhythmic distant clangs of metal on metal some 
distance to the south.

Sweltering Forge and Foundry~
   Waves of heat shimmer across the interior of this gigantic 
building, the roaring fires of a dozen forges bringing sweat to 
the skin of all the multitudes of soot-covered goblins and humans 
that scurry across the dark rock floor. Clad only in scraps of 
rags and loincloths, numerous branded slaves work the floors, the 
dull ringing of metal sounding from the anvils accompanied by 
grunts and groans of exertion from the teams manning the gigantic 
mechanism of pumps and billows set in the centre of the room. 
Trails of workers move from the production line of wicked weapons 
and thick armours to the squat doors set in the western wall, 
struggling under their load of crates, while more dour humanoids 
enter and leave through the large southern doors.

   This cramped, dimly-lit cave has been crudely riven from the 
mountainside. The walls are lined with pegs that have either 
been driven through old wooden boards, or simply placed through 
one of the numerous punched out knot-holes in the stone. From 
the pegs hang bows and crossbows in various stages of completion. 
A table full of tools has been set up in the center of this 
building for the shop owner to stand behind and a rough mat has 
been tossed in the corner for a bed.

Bustling Sorting Room~
   This large stone room is the centre of a bustling packing and 
sorting activity. Numerous rag clad human mongrels of Minas 
Morgul, their pale skin and mismatching hair and eye colours a 
clear betrayal of their mixed blood origins, shuffle to and fro 
amongst the massive racks, sorting and shifting through massive 
crates of jagged weaponry and beaten armours. Overseeing their 
movements are black-skinned orcs, bellowing orders and lashing 
out with whips at those who move too slowly in collating 
supplies. A gigantic pair of doors is set in the eastern wall, 
sweltering heat emanating from within, the occasional cartload of 
goods being dragged out. A low pit is set in the south western 
corner, grim-faced humans busy sharpening and scraping at rusted 
weapons and armour.

of the stout iron gates set in the high western wall. Large 
crates are arranged in a haphazard manner all throughout the 
area, the poor organisation not helped by the massive influx of

To the east, a massive building formed from huge blocks of stone 
rises up, a trail of crates carried by gaunt humans through the 
large door set in it.

Along Sharkundu Road~
   This side road is fairly well-traveled by a mixture of orcs, 
goblins, and humans, much of the incessant decay of the rest of 
the city failing to seek its purchase here. The street ends at a 
busy intersection to the north, while leading south it is lined 
with buildings hewn from the same rock that lies underfoot and 
looms distantly overhead in the form of an ancient, towering 
cliff that dominates the southern border of the city.

Along Sharkundu Road~
   A large, unmarked shop stands to the west side of this dark, 
stone cobbled road, its base made of mortared brick and its 
top-half constructed of wooden planks. A steady stream of 
travelers make their way up and down the road, the sound of 
footsteps filling the air as they echo off the high walls on 
either side. Travel to the east is blocked by the burned down 
husks of buildings that once made this city their home. Further 
to the south, a towering cliff wall creates an overhang above a 
large, fairly popular building.

making it quite difficult to breathe. Rusty wood-working tools 
and freshly made tables fill the place, while one corner is 
stacked with wooden planks. A large sarcophagus stacked with 
bedding lies in one corner, around which is scattered numerous 
tankards and glass bottles, shows that the carpenter also lives 
in this jumbled mess.

unworn by the passage of boots and years, but now the once busy 
intersection stands empty, the tavern to the south looking to 
have been hastily boardesd shut. A few figures move between the

the sky.

panelled in a dark wood along the walls, beneath an unadorned 
stone ceiling. A simple table in the center for people to sit 
and eat is the only furnishing found here, with space for perhaps 
a dozen at once. A stairwell reaches up towards another chamber, 
while a trapdoor in the southwestern corner of the chamber blocks 
out most of the noise of pain and despair from below.

unmistakeable click of heavy boots on unyielding stone blend to 
provide a constant backdrop of noise. 
   The northern door has been strengthened to form the entrance 
to the Slaver Armory.

A Winding, Dirt Path Through the Slums~
   The way grows narrow and cramped along this filthy dirt 
pathway as it snakes between a ramshackle hut and the back wall 
of a dingy stone building. Gnawed bones and tattered clothing 
are scattered among the heaps of various refuse that litters the 
area. The stench of rot and decay is heavy in the air, lifting 
only slightly toward the west where a cobblestone crossroads is 
visible. Goblins slink by this place often, scrounging in the 
trash or fighting amongst themselves over a scrap of food.

   The narrow dirt pathway snakes in all cardinal directions at

makeshift tents and firepits. The air is thick with decay and 
orc, and the sounds of squabbling goblins or an orkish tussle are 
common. Whenever it rains, the mingled dust, refuse, and trash 
mixes into a truly disgusting soup of mud and filth. Far off to 
the west, the slum buildings can be seen petering out toward a 
run-down cobblestone crossroads.

grimy slick walls of old stone, crumbling and further blocking 
easy travel along this path. Putrid odors frequent this ally as 
the grimy walls raise high and narrow enough to keep the light of

mingled with the trash, which desperate goblins are often seen 
picking out. The air is oppressively thick with the stench of

squalor of the orkish slums, with hard, packed dirt and filth 
underfoot. The stench of refuse and rot hangs heavy in the air, 
and run-down huts, rickety shacks, and makeshift camps clutter 
the area, leaving little extra room to maneuver. To the west, a

footprints can be seen tracked in and out of it, as well as a 
generous amount of dried blood and gore splatters mixed in with 
the dirt underfoot.

A Curve in the Dirt Path Through the Slums~
   This path is little more then an alleyway connecting a small 
square to the south and the northern sprawl of the orkish slums. 
Occasionally the side of the road is occupied by a ragged blanket 
or small campfire where one orc or another had slept or is 
sleeping now. The dirt here is hard and cracked, stained a dark 
red color. Patrols are rarely seen on this road, being well out 
of the way of the tower.

A Dirt Path Through Orkish Slums~
   This dirt path leads off from a small square to the south 
smelling strongly of orc. Litter and trash clog small ditches in 
the side of the road. An occasional tarp is built out of rough 
canvas on the side of one of the buildings to protect their 
orkish inhabitants from the midday sun. The dirt here is oddly 
solid and cracked, stained a dark red color. Patrols are rarely 
seen on this road being well out of the way of the tower.

A Grungy Dwelling~
   A tattered piece of cloth partially conceals the entrance to 
this tiny room, little more than a hole in the wall of a 
broken-down building. Evidence of this place being lived in is 
everywhere in the form of cluttered junk piled in the corners and 
a few grimy mats laid out on the floor. The ashes of a small 
cooking fire lie to one side of the entrance, black soot caked on 
the wall behind it.

A Dirt Trail Slinking Through Orkish Slums~
   Careful steps must be taken on this twisting trail to avoid 
the piles of refuse lying about everywhere. Torn pieces of drab 
clothing mingle with piles of scrapped metal giving the piles a 
twisted and spiky silhouette. Shards of bone and other pieces of 
animal lie about, even the occasional goblin skull can be found. 
The path squirms its way through this trash from east to west, 
with the shouts of orcs and goblins occasionally tainting the 
air.

A Dirt Trail In The Orkish Slums~
   Weaving and twisting through discarded trash and bones long 
since gnawed clean, this trail ends here abruptly. To the north 
with a sloped drift of festering waste on each side is a short 
wooden door. All around the constant reek of the slums pervades 
the air and the sounds of disturbance often echo across the 
shanties. The ground seems to slope towards the battered 
building to the north.

A Decrepit Shanty~
   The walls of this room are all rounded, giving this shanty the 
look of a cylinder from the inside. The grimy dark stone of the 
walls has held up well over time and in fact appear to be very 
solid yet. Strangely enough the floor seems to slant inwards 
from all sides of the wall finally reaching the lowest point in 
the center of the room. Due to the shape of the floor years of 
rainwater has brought thick grime from the slums into this room, 
and a layer of black muck coats the floor. In the center, where 
the muck is the thickest, a few chunks of metal grating can be 
seen poking up.

   The smell of unwashed bodies mingles with rotting trash in 
this corner of the square, as an alleyway leads off to the east 
towards an oversized garbage heap. To the north is the main 
entrance and exit to this place, a medium-sized dirt path snaking 
through the slums of Minas Morgul. Rising up high in the 
distance over the poorly-made buildings of this district is 
Morgul Tower, clearly visible to the northwest.

A Crowded, Dirt-Covered Square~
   A small square spreads forth here, orkish shops and housing 
built to varying degrees of completion lining the edges of this 
square, which is busy at all times of night. During the day, 
however, far fewer orcs walk the streets. It is rare to see any 
military patrols coming this way as this place is of little 
importance to them. It does, however, see the passage of all 
sorts of orkish toughs, merchants and beggars and is one of the 
more popular places for commerce in Minas Morgul.

A Crowded, Dirt-Covered Square~
   The dirt underfoot has long since been packed into a solid, 
hard surface under the constant trampling of visitors to this 
square. Some tents are scattered across the square, but the 
majority of businesses here are run from a row of shoddy 
buildings lining the edges. A crude rendition of a boot has been 
carved into the wooden door of a shop to the west, while south of 
here a ragged wolf pelt hangs from the doorframe of another 
building.

A Crowded, Dirt-Covered Square~
   A foul stench clings to this square where various tents and 
covers have been set up to shield their orkish inhabitants from 
the sun. Numerous businesses have been set up out of flimsy 
wooden buildings in this square. This square is packed with all 
sorts of orcs, especially during the night, and is perhaps the 
most oft-visted square for orkish business in the city except 
Arena Square. A small, busy shop is to the south.

A Large, Disorganized, Orkish Armor Shop~
   Pieces of armor are thrown all about this store in a 
disorganized jumble with no apparent order or design. The shop 
remains dark at all hours of the day, no natural light seeping 
through. Even with the clutter the shop is still big enough to 
fit a dozen orcs inside, and often does being one of the most 
popular businesses in the city, though very few of them are 
human. The floor of this shop is built out of layered pine, 
marked with many scars and dents where a bit of armor had been 
unceremoniously dumped.

been piled hap-hazardly. The walls of this shop often have a 
rough piece of cloth stretched over one corner or another to 
block out the light or rain that might filter into this shop 
otherwise. The owner has added a back door leading back and 
forth between the square and the street, a shortcut the owner 
clearly hoped would provide more business, but just seems to have 
increased traffic.

A single thatched rug lies just inside the entrance, mud and dirt

Another building lies just to the north, a small adobe hut with a 
few old crates piled around outside to make steps up to enter it. 
The building to the south is fairly well preserved and has a 
couple glass windows placed to allow view of the front doorstep. 
A large mound of trash has been piled to the east, though it is 
mostly stone and wood.

Tables are gathered around towards the center of the room

animals and other orcs hang from the walls, their faces contorted 
in a hideous death rictus giving this room the feel of some sort 
of dark hunting lodge. A bit of moisture clings to the air, the 
wooden log made walls beginning to rot ever so slightly. A 
roughly-painted wooden door hangs south of here while a short 
hall heads out to the east. 
   A pair of windows faces the street allowing the onlooker to 
survey passerbys.

set up here. Weapons in various stages of completion hang from 
the walls as well as various tools and raw implements. A large 
chimney made out of stone is on top of the ceiling to allow the 
smoke and heat to escape the wooden building. A bed in fairly

the heat from the forge itself, though the room remains

occasionally broken stairs lead deeper down into some old wine 
cellar that has been since converted by these orcs. Broken 
weapons hang from their hilts on the walls, of various sorts and 
shades including an old uniform, clearly of human nature.

throughout this chamber though the sound is somewhat hard to 
place. The floor is made of wooden boards, many of which have 
been torn up, while the walls are made of stone bricks. The 
bricks have been torn open on the west wall where a rough tunnel 
has been dug out of the inky darkness leading an undeterminable 
way deeper underground.

   Littered with greasy bones and lined with midden heaps to 
either side, this pathway is perhaps narrower than it originally 
was. The refuse is piled high against the dingy mudbrick, 
wooden, and stone walls of the huts that clutter the landscape 
like rotted mushrooms or festering boils. The stench is truly 
powerful, filling the nose and mouth with the scent of orcs. 
   Beneath is a dusty, footstep-worn trail running north to 
south, which turns to a treacherous mire whenever it rains.

   There is little room to maneuver here, but plenty to clamber 
over and duck behind, due to the heaps of refuse and filth that 
are piled to the sides of this alleyway. Makeshift shanties, 
crumbling stone huts, and other buildings in various states of 
decay line the way thickly, clustered so tightly together that it 
only adds to the stifling, claustrophobic atmosphere of despair 
and desperation. A sharp twist in the alley snakes between two 
relatively sturdy mudbrick hovels to the west, and the way 
continues in a fairly straight manner to the north.

and the southern wall even has some mudpack replacing some 
obviously crumbled stone. Nothing prevents the permeating stench 
of the slum outside from creeping into the hovel, and the smell

blankets are piled off to one side, the occasional wounded goblin 
hunched there while they retrieve treatment, only to scamper off

Twist in the Path at a Broken Cart~
   The narrow trail twists south and east here, bending where a 
broken cart has long ago lost its last wheel. Small, white 
insects the size of ants clamber all over the wooden cart, 
burrowing and eating at what is left of it. A doorway to the 
west leads to a small building, a trail of termites heading from 
it to the cart. The footing is somewhat treacherous here, as 
carelessly discarded debris is piled haphazardly, the pathway 
that remains mostly due to those passerby who bother to kick 
trash away from it.

A Tiny Wooden Hut Infested With Bugs~
   The wood of this hut was a poor choice to use as a building 
material. After a few years of rain and moisture rot set in, 
softening the wood for easy attack from insects. A look at any 
part of the walls or roof show thousands of small holes, gored 
into the wood all over by the teeth of these small insects. 
Crawling along the ground, up the walls and all over the roof are 
tiny ant sized bugs of a pale white color. They dig and scurry 
about continually, delving in and out of their burrows in the 
wood. Due to the continual motion of the insects the walls at 
first glance appear to move.

   The stone walls of housing stretch along the northern side of

torn canvas and cloth stretched from roof to roof throughout the 
slum. The path continues on to the west and east with a branch 
heading down towards the south. The occasional rat makes a 
daring run through the feet of the slum dwellers, heading from 
one pile of discarded trash to another. The dead bodies and 
bones of rats that were stepped on add to the decayed odor

goblins there is nearly a constant flow of traffic coming from 
the door to the north or going into it. The volume of slum 
dwellers moving through here has actually kept the area 
relatively clean, any trash finding its way to the ground quickly 
getting trampled and kicked away.

A Dilapidated Orc House~
   This house with a slightly sagging roof marks the owner as an 
orc of fairly high stature to own a building note shared by 
multitudes of orcs. Yet, it is hard to picture this as a reality 
when the whole building looks like it might collapse at any 
moment. Slightly larger in size than a gardener's shed, this 
house is made out of roughly cut wooden planks of varying sizes, 
likely salvaged from one building or another. Though small and 
modestly furnished, this house could still likely hold as many as 
five orcs sleeping here.

A Bumpy, Narrow Dirt Alley~
   The narrow pathway crawling in from the east widens here, into 
a larger, yet uneven and treacherously pitted dirt alleyway. The 
makeshift tents are fewer, the area being mainly stone and brick 
huts, their walls covered in years of filth, grime, and neglect. 
The alley itself bends gradually to the south, continuing its way 
through the heavy stench and decay of the orkish slums.

An Intersection Of Narrow Alleyways~
   The smell and sounds of the slums are thick here, rank with 
squalor and harsh clamor. The ground underfoot is hard and 
cracked, littered with debris, bones, and other dubious-looking 
objects and substances. The haphazard placement of the various 
hovels and shanties that have sprung up like mold in this quarter 
means that the alleyways are crooked as an orc's nose, weaving 
drunkenly along to the north, south, and west.

Path Past Crumbling Buildings~
   This path snakes through a mis-mash of dismal, crumbling stone 
and mudbrick buildings, most of them partially lacking a ceiling 
or being nearly caved in. Rats skitter and squeak almost 
constantly, often seen darting between heaps of refuse that are 
as tall as a goblin in some places. Humanoid bones lie scattered 
off to one side of the trail, long since picked of any valuable 
meat or even gristle. The way continues its twisted way both 
north and south, picking its way through the chaos of the slums.

A Very Narrow Alleyway Between Buildings~
   Squeezing between rows of dilapidated hovels, this 
mud-splattered alley emits a foul stench within its tight 
confines. The sound of raucous passerby drifts in from the west, 
where a wider street is visible, while a maze of orc and goblin 
houses form the slums to the east. Rats scurry between the 
shadows, competing with the miserable inhabitants of these 
dwellings for scraps of food. Against the south side of this 
alley, a roofless, mudbrick hovel presses its wall in, making the 
way all that more narrow.

crudely-hewn stone blocks pieced together to form the walls and 
ceiling. A large, damp patch of mold has taken over the northern 
wall; the floor directly under it littered with the dead bodies 
of rodents and insects. The building appears to be occupied by a 
shifting number of inhabitants, apparent in the various pallets 
and nests strewn across the floor, along with the remains of a 
cooking fire in one corner.

sides save a small gap to the north. A battered doorway is set 
in the wall of the only hut facing the trail, the others choosing 
to turn their backs on this filthy patch of the orkish slums. 
The sky is a murky patch of color above the rooftops, slightly 
more visible to the west, where the roof has given in to the 
weight of years and poor attention.

shelter from the changeable moods of the skies above Minas 
Morgul. What beams there were have splintered and fallen in, 
making it rather easy for anyone to simply clamber up and peer 
over the top wall to the north. A door lies to the east and is 
hardly more than a battered decoration, the lock long smashed 
away. The floor is mainly packed debris, dust, and rubble, but 
there is a corner cleared away enough to rest in some comfort.

An Uneven, Narrow Dirt Alley~
   This packed dirt alley is just wide enough for two or three 
goblins to walk side-by-side, lined with squat, mildewing stone 
huts and disheveled shacks. Bones and piles of refuse have been 
kicked away from the trail to gather in huge midden heaps between 
and against the walls of the orkish dwellings. The air is heavy 
and thick, both with the density of bodies living in this 
squalor, and with the stench of their way of living.

   More the collision of two winding dirt trails than an actual 
widened intersection, this place is curiously devoid of the piled 
heaps of trash that clutter most of the orkish slums. Traffic 
seems heavy here, many goblinoid figures often seen moving 
through, and several can be seen off to the west, near a 
smoldering firepit surrounded by a couple disheveled-looking 
canvas tents. The trail continues on its crooked path to the 
north and east.

profusely, rats and cockroaches skittering in and about it. A 
broken crate lies off to the side, against a shack wall, any 
contents it may have once held long pilfered. Rough canvas tents 
circle a firepit near the intersection that's visible just to the 
east, the trail making a zig-zag pattern around it.

moss that rules over the walls and roof here. Numerous pallets 
and nest of assorted furs roam across the poorly constructed 
house, passage to the archway in the northern wall and gaping 
hole in the middle of the floor done through a maze of bedding. 
A solid door opens outwards to the east, onto the reeking slums 
of Minas Morgul.

   This trail is barely wide enough for two goblins to walk side 
by side, slinking slowly between squat stone and wood dwellings, 
makeshift tents, and various campsites where the occasional group 
of orkish kin are gathered. A stink of close quarters and 
unsanitary living fills the air, combined with the scent of raw 
meat and blood, the latter of which stains the dusty ground in 
several locations. The pathway narrows to a mere gap to the 
east, and widens into an intersection just to the west.

oft-travelled pathway, as the ground is worn clear and dusty, 
packed down by the passage of countless footsteps. The 
windowless huts sit in stony silence, looming over the cramped 
area and providing at least some shade during most times of day. 
The path continues on its crooked way to the north and west.

   Slinking between buildings like a lurking goblin in fear of 
its life, this pathway's narrow passage is made even more cramped 
by the large amounts of refuse cluttering it. Broken beams and 
shattered stone litter the area, and the semblance of a wall 
stands to either side, suggesting that it was once a hut that has 
fallen into such disrepair that it has been transformed into a 
shortcut between the alleys that snake through the orkish slums.

A Shadowy Three-Way Intersection~
   The buildings press so closely in on this meeting of two 
pathways that the sky is reduced to a tiny crack of light above 
the tallish, ramshackle dwellings that surround the area. To 
further block out any light, pieces of raggedy canvas have been 
stretched across the intersection, casting it mostly into shadow 
no matter the weather or time of day. Goblinoid bones are a 
common sight mixed in with the trash, as well as those of rats, a 
few live ones often seen slinking warily about.

   The air hanging heavy about this pathway stinks more than the 
average spot in the slums, being obvious to all but the most 
de-sensitized of noses. The ground is packed dirt and filth, 
rats and cockroaches skittering in and about various midden heaps 
shoved off to the sides. The sky is a mere sliver above the 
tight press of cramped dwellings, and there is only room enough 
to move single-file between them. 
   The path widens slightly to the east, and takes a sharp twist 
between two rickety huts to the north.

   The stench of decomposition and refuse is incredibly strong 
here, originating from somewhere beyond a rickety wooden gate to 
the east. The pathway itself is littered with refuse so thick it 
is difficult to find the dirt-packed ground, and the piles of 
trash only get worse the closer one gets to the gates. Crumbling 
dwellings hem the pathway in, lending the area a cramped, 
claustrophobic atmosphere. 
   A narrow gap between the slum-houses is visible to the north 
and to the west, both ways even more cramped than this tiny 
intersection.

A Festering, Trash-Filled Enclosure~
   A small hut or hovel at one time, over the many years of slum 
life it has developed into a crude dumping ground for trash. The 
midden pile seems to have been pushed in here from the streets, 
and it rises now to nearly the roof of the hut in the middle. 
The walls have accrued the years of slime and gristle coming off 
the garbage and are coated in a layer of slimy mucus. The trash 
is however soft compared to the hard packed ground of the streets 
and despite the assaulting smell of rancid decomposition, goblins 
can be seen occasionally making bed in the pile.

   This pathway picks its way in a crooked fashion between 
buildings like the course of some drunken goblin. It was 
apparently made after the construction of a few slum houses by 
the simple fact that one could move between the buildings, rather 
than being a pre-planned course. The ground is worn clear of 
trash and debris, but the refuse is still visible off to the 
sides, piled in heaps against the walls. 
   The way eventually widens a bit, both to the north and south.

   What may once have been a modest square for the residents of 
this city to gather, draw water from the well, and wash clothing 
is now a decrepit, stinking space full of orkish refuse and the 
gnawed bones of the already dead. A sour scent of decomposition 
even stronger than the normal smell of the slums can often be 
detected in the air near this tiny area, originating from 
somewhere to the south. There are no doorways in the walls of 
the buildings which line this square, all of them having their 
backs turned, as if in denial. Pathways, more like accidental 
openings between cramped dwellings rather than alleys, wind 
crookedly away from the square to the north, east, and south.

where a building is squeezed in so tightly against to others that 
it's impossible to continue on. An all-too familiar stench of 
urine and feces can be detected, mingled with trash and rotted 
meat. To the west, the way widens slightly, giving a glimpse of 
a debris-choked square.

large, but no less shoddy in appearance. The wooden walls are 
covered in a curious, moldy fungus, and despite the lack of 
windows, the cracks between the boards allow some air to filter 
through. The doorway hangs precariously on one hinge, creaking 
noisily at the slightest gust of wind. There is actually a 
floor, made of now crumbling bricks, slimy substances and grime 
oozing in the cracks between them.

crumbling stone wall. Rats and cockroaches swarm about a 
generous heap of filthy debris, bones, and other such unsavory 
things, any scraps of food that may have existed already snatched 
away by starving goblins. A narrow entryway to a hut stands to 
the east, and a filthy tarp is strung between two buildings 
across the path, though it is rent and torn too much to be of use 
in sheltering from the sun's harsh glare.

   The design of this hovel was definitely not for the comfort of 
its occupants. The walls are barely long enough apart for an orc 
to lie and have the markings and scratches of many an impact with 
hardened objects. At just under six feet the ceiling imposes 
itself on any with tall stature. Made of thick wood long since 
covered in mildew and other growths, the many crevices in the 
roof make a haven for small animals. By the sounds of small feet 
and squeaks coming from above, it seems apparent that those 
animals have made this their home some time ago.

intersection until it is nearly hard as stone, softening only 
slightly into stinking muck when it rains. The ever-present 
debris and trash is piled off to the sides, against the walls of

Several small, makeshift tents clutter any free space surrounding

   This is apparently a rather popular pathway through the 
cramped orkish slums, deduced mainly by the fact that the way is 
mostly cleared of trash and debris. The dirt underfoot is packed 
solid, dust mingled with other more unsavory substances. The way 
continues unobstructed to the south, and northward it widens a 
bit, goblins and orcs often visible lurking about the area.

   The debris and filth of the slums is no less here than 
anywhere else in this forsaken Quarter, but has at least been 
kicked mostly out of the way of passerby, piled high against the 
crumbling walls of the orkish dwellings that have long since been 
falling into neglected disrepair. The air is thick and rancid 
with the smells of trash and rot, and the trampled dirt ground is 
often mucky in various places with puddles of one suspicious 
fluid or another. The trail itself labors crookedly through the 
huts and squat-houses, winding north and west.

little escape from the constant presence of filth, trash, and 
general squalor, but most of the lurking goblins and orcs that 
occasionally skulk through this area seem to take little to no 
notice of it at all. Rodent eyes gleam occasionally from behind 
piles of midden, and huge cockroaches scrabble about, some almost 
as big as a goblin's palm.

   The shouts and clamor of the slums can often be heard drifting

The twisting dirt path slinks between the dwellings, less a 
planned road and more a path picked out over time due to the 
convenience of shortcutting between various squat stone or wood 
huts. It winds its way off to the south and west, littered with 
gnawed bones, tattered shreds of now-useless clothing, and other 
sorts of worthless, stinking refuse.

almost fearlessly through the area, disappearing in the shadows 
of the closely-pressed, decrepit dwellings. What ground isn't 
covered with debris is merely packed dirt, and bones, picked 
clean and gnawed thoroughly, are scattered visibly about. The 
path makes its way gradually in a north to south direction.

An End of Morgul Road~
   Here lies one end of a long trek through Morgul Vale, in the 
form of a broad, hard-packed dirt road that snakes its way 
through this valley between the towering cliffs of the Ephel 
Duath. The foul waters of the River Morgulduin flow by to the 
north, its banks dotted with deformed, pale white flowers that 
give off a sickening odor. 
   To the west, a long stone bridge crosses the river, while the 
great gates of Minas Morgul itself stand between a gap in the 
mountains on the southern side of the vale.

The Slavemaster's Office~
   This small, efficient office is far better lit than the 
chamber outside. Cool stone walls, sparsely decorated and 
windowless, give an almost claustrophobic feel. Sparse furniture 
and cobwebs suggest this place is functional rather than 
comfortable.

An Interrogation Cell~
   This large stone room is well lit by several large wall 
sconces as well as a huge bronze brazier in the middle of the 
room. Its flames cast wild shadows across the black stone walls, 
fitting complement to the grim business that goes on here. In 
the center, next to the brazier, are a set of manacles and a 
rather bloody drain hole.

A Dark, Quiet Cell~
   This tiny, rank little stone cell radiates an air of bleak 
hopelessness. Not even a rodent's scurrying interrupts the quiet 
gloom. A set of thick, jagged wrought-iron manacles adorns each 
wall. The scent of mold and death are the only distractions 
aside from the distant echo of the rooms beyond.

Inside a Very Cluttered Tent~
   All manner of materials goods lie strewn about this tent, 
piled on counters and overflowing from rickety crates. This tent 
functions as a pawn shop of sorts, and the majority of items 
passing through seem to be of human make. It seems as though 
anything and everything can be found here, if one has the 
inclination to search for it.

A Broad, Muddy Path Approaching the Arena~
   The ground here is softer, dirt and mud churned up to make for 
an uneven surface upon this path. Rearing up to the south is the 
gargantuan form of the Witchking's Arena, dominating the view in 
that direction. Slaves condemned to fighting for their lives in 
the arena are driven southward along the path. Bones and other 
refuse lie scattered along the sides of the road, while a wooden 
fence surrounds a wagonyard to the east.

Slave Road Passing Through Rows of Tents and Caravans~
   Slave Road stretches out to the east and west, a hard-packed 
dirt road scored with numerous wagon ruts of varying sizes 
running parallel to a wooden wall that stands to the north. Some 
caravans are stationed alongside the road, a number of tents and 
pavilions set up between them. Slavers mill about, catching some 
rest beside a campfire, or going about their business between 
raiding expeditions. The road itself continues to bustle with 
activity, though moreso at night than during the day. Southward 
is a large wagonyard, fenced in by crooked lengths of wood and 
metal stakes.

A Stinking Underground Chamber~
   This passage has been roughly hewn from the volcanic rock of 
the surrounding cliff-side, leading at a sharp slope underneath 
the tavern. The foul, gloomy air is oppressive in its stench, 
permeated with the stink of sweat, blood, and other bodily 
fluids. Underfoot, the ground is strewn with a layer of grit and 
straw, forming a trail that leads to and from a solid gate of 
blackened iron standing at the southern end of this chamber.

A Cavernous Underground Room~
   Built beneath and into the jagged cliff of the tavern above, 
this pit is little more than a large hole in the ground. A 
sparse gathering of small torches, wedged into the dark stone 
surroundings within crude iron bands, provide barely sufficient 
illumination for the human eye. Crowded about the blood-stained 
pit in the center of the room is a circle of carelessly built 
wooden benches with rough, splinter-filled surfaces. Orcs 
congregate here at all hours of the day with much of the seating 
filled to observe the fights put on display, normally two of the 
war-like creatures spilling off the excess of their drink with 
blows or the execution of another prisoner slave through single 
combat. A narrow opening barred by a black iron gate in the 
northern cave wall is the only way out of this place.

A Small, Gated-Off Tunnel with a Ladder Leading Up~
   An iron ladder leads up to a manhole and out of this tunnel on 
the north end of the room. The collapsed stone walls of this 
chamber give the impression that it may be part of some long 
collapsed sewer system that threaded through and out of Minas 
Morgul. An iron-grafted gate blocks passage south, its hinges 
deep set into the surrounding rock and grunting noise 
occasionally labor from behind the gate, although no light issues 
forth.

A Large, Underground Lair Strewn with Crude Beds and Nests~
   This tunnel has been recently dug out deeper, a disorderly 
scramble of bedding, nests and mats have been spread across the 
floor as if a flock of nightmarish birds had set up their roost 
here. All and all the low-ceilinged chamber allows no light to 
enter within its reach and the smell of orc is quite heavy here. 
A short tunnel to the east is the only way to gain access to this 
room. The tunnel itself is a very tight fit and far shorter then 
most orcs, even with their stooped posture.

A Pungent-Smelling Cavern~
   This cavern, slightly smaller than the adjoining one to the 
south, bustles with activity at all hours as medics and tribal 
healers tend to the wounded lucky enough to get dragged back from 
the battlefield. Pallets and nests are thrown haphazardly all 
over the floor, crowding against one another so closely that the 
patients must lie almost on top of each other. A sharply pungent 
odor pervades the air, coming from the salves and elixers brewed 
by orkish healers at the back of the cavern. Some patients 
scream and thrash, while others bear the ordeal stoically, and 
the dead carted out now and then by goblin slaves. A wide 
archway to the south is the only entrance and exit to this place, 
leading out to the common area.

An Enormous, Depressed Cavern~
   Apparently a common gathering place for the orc-kin of the 
Witchking's Horde, this spacious cavern has a high ceiling that 
curves overhead, its apex disappearing into the murky darkness. 
Tunnels branch off in many directions. The ground slopes down 
towards the center, creating a large depression that gives the 
cavern the vague appearance of a hollow ball. Small firepits and 
circles of rocks lie scattered about for the use of the dozens of 
orcs and goblins lounging here. Flickering light from the fires 
cast the often grotesque shadows of this cavern's inhabitants on 
the floor and walls in a way that can only add to the already 
chaotic atmosphere. The space is filled with the noise of crude 
bantering and jesting, interrupted by the occasional brawl. 
   To the south, a rounded door carved with a pair of striking 
lightning bolts stands, the general orkin dwellers in the warrens 
giving the portalway a considerable space free before it.

A Branch in the Tunnels~
   The tunnels branch here, twisting north and south while a 
large cavern opens up to the west. Though the stone seems to be 
naturally formed, it has been widened both to the sides and above 
to allow even the largest of orcs to pass through with ease. The 
tunnels wind onward into darkness, while light and raucous noise 
spills from the western cavern.

A Wide, Curving Tunnel~
   Carved by hand, this curving tunnel is wide enough for a 
formation of orc-kin to march through unhindered. A crude series 
of paintings has been splashed onto the western wall, depicting 
simple, exaggerated figures waging combat upon a stony field. 
Orcs and goblins travel through often, making this a well- 
populated passage.

coats the ground beneath them. The tunnel continues westward,

way roughly to the north and east. Jagged walls of basalt are 
stained in places with blood and others with feces. Insects 
crawl along the rock, occasionally picked off to be eaten by a 
passing goblin. A thin layer of dirt trails along the ground.

bones, and slopes slightly downward the further south it goes.

A Cramped, Foul-Smelling Warren~
   Orc-spawn and their caretakers jostle noisily for space, for 
though this cavern is quite large it is made cramped by the sheer 
number of occupants residing in it. The stench of sweat and 
waste pervades the air, mixing with smoke that is given off by a 
smouldering firepit entrenched in the center of this roughly 
circular warren. Nests and crude bedding lie in clusters across 
the ground while their occupants are often seen moving around the 
area, females jabbering at each other, infants writhing about, 
young adolescents bullying one another in a constant struggle to 
establish dominance and pecking order. Numerous tunnels branch 
outward in every direction, leading into darkness.

quality that amplifies the unruly noise that often fills this 
underworld playing field. The ground has been worn smooth in 
places while remaining rough in others, pitted here and there 
with a pothole or a sharp stalagmite thrusting upward to punish 
the unwary. Shoved against the northern and southern walls are 
rows of benches raised precariously on wooden stands. A single 
tunnel leads back out to the east.

Lond Nirnaeth Entering the Morgul Vale~
   The cracked and weed covered road once known as Lond Nirnaeth 
travels northeast up the narrowing valley of the Morgul Vale. 
The vale itself is a dry and desolate place, with barren and 
rocky soil in which only the most hearty plants can grow. Both 
the road and its surroundings seem to worsen further east, while 
to the west the land crosses dry plains and eventually opens up 
onto the more fertile countryside of the Ithilien. 
   To the south, the waters of the Morgulduin flow past on their 
journey out of the mouth of the Vale.

Bank of the Morgulduin in the Morgul Vale~
   Rank and smelling strongly of sulphur, the River Morgulduin 
flows at the base of the sheer mountains which form the south 
wall of the Morgul Vale. The river here seems fetid and 
unwholesome, but smaller streams and rivulets join it as it flows 
west, making it increasingly pure as it flows further from Minas 
Morgul. The land near the river seems to have benefited little 
from its moisture, and remains barren, rocky, and near-lifeless. 
   The river flows from the Morgul Vale into the lands of 
Ithilien to the west.

   The deep and sulphur scented waters of the River Morgulduin 
flow westward, emerging through a large metallic grate set 
beneath a bridge just to the east. The river seems fetid and 
unwholesome, but smaller springs and rivulets join it as it flows 
to the west, rendering it more clean the further it flows from 
Minas Morgul. The river flows right at the base of towering 
basalt and obsidian cliffs which border the south side of the 
Morgul Vale.

Lond Nirnaeth in the Morgul Vale~
   The once great road known among the men of Gondor as Lond 
Nirnaeth travels to the east and southwest, traveling up the 
middle of the narrow canyon known as the Morgul Vale. Only the 
most hearty and stubborn briars and thorned bushes cling to life 
in the near lifeless soil. The vale is bounded to the north and 
south by the steep and foreboding mountain walls of the Ephel 
Duath, the border mountains which surround Mordor. 
   The claw-like top of a dark tower can be seen quite some 
distance to the southeast.

Lond Nirnaeth in the Morgul Vale~
   Rutted and filled with potholes, the road once known as Lond 
Nirnaeth travels east to west down the middle of the Morgul Vale. 
The vale, a long valley which pierces through the border 
mountains which protect the west edge of Mordor, narrows to the 
east. Tall sheer faced cliffs almost seem to lean in over the 
vale to the north and south. The air seems to never quite be 
still, and the occasional scent of sulphur can be discerned on a 
stray breeze.

Lond Nirnaeth in the Morgul Vale~
   Rutted, cracked and full of potholes, the once proud roadway 
crawls east and west across the barren landscape of the Morgul 
Vale. The vale itself narrows to the east, funneled by the near 
vertical peaks that make up Ephel Duath, the barrier mountains 
that surround Mordor. Stubborn shrubs and thorny bushes fight 
for life in the unforgiving soil and dry air. 
   A tall, ominous tower can be seen to the southeast, where it 
rises visibly between the mountain peaks.

   A steep cliff-face of black basalt and obsidian seems to lean 
over the floor of the Morgul Vale. Rising thousands of feet from 
the valley floor, the border mountains create a nearly impassable 
barrier protecting the west flank of Mordor. Only Morgul Vale 
provides ready access through this obstacle. Almost unnatural in 
appearance, nothing living clings to the impossibly steep rock 
face. A few streams of smoke or steam escape from cracks or 
vents high above. The air seems to constantly move, and the 
occasional whiff of sulphur is carried on the breeze.

Morgul Vale at a Cliff Face~
   A steep cliff-face of black basalt and obsidian seems to lean 
over the floor of the Morgul Vale. Rising thousands of feet from

Morgul Road Curving West and North~
   Morgul Road cuts a swath through the otherwise inpenetrable 
Mountains of Shadow, curving to the west and north as it follows 
the valley. The road is unpaved, its dry and dusty surface 
appearing to have been stamped flat by the countless number of 
feet journeying upon it over the centuries. Sloping down to the 
northwest are the banks of the River Morgulduin, behind which 
loom great black mountain faces as well as to the south.

Morgul Vale Under the Shadow of Mountains~
   The jagged, basaltic rock that forms the Ephel Duath is shorn 
away here to create a flat cliff face that looms over Morgul 
Vale. The valley's landscape is desolate and lifeless, comprised 
only of a yellowish river to the north, a wide dirt road, and the 
barren earth that lies at the foot of the mountains. Crumbling 
boulders and bits of rock remain strewn about the ground, 
providing small pockets of shelter but little else.

Hot, Sultry, Cage~
   Numerous, near-naked humans sit huddled upon the floor of this 
large cage, sickly acceptance of their plight as slaves and the 
impending torturous fate that will follow spread across their 
sweat drenches faces. Thick, immovable iron bars form the 
confines of this dark, dank cage, the faltering light filtering 
through from the south providing only enough illumination to 
distinguish shapes in the gloom. Whimpers, moans, groans and 
screams sound forth from beyond the heavy cage-door set in the 
north of the cage, while those gathered here await their fate 
with a harrowing silence.

Tiny, Muck-Encrusted Cell~
   The four walls of this cage, fashioned from iron bars, are set 
to close together that there is space only for a sole occupant, 
and even then their movement is restricted by the thick, 
blackened pieces of metal. The rank stench of urine hangs heavy 
in the air here, the earthen floor of this cell damp to the feet. 
Set in the western wall of this cell is an outwards swinging 
gate, secured by a large, rusty lock. From the west shouts and 
pleas drift into the cage, along with the occasional grunt of 
anger, this sound soon followed by a flat, wet, packing sound.

Filth-Filled Earthen Alcove~
   Various parts of human and goblin anatomy litter the floor of 
this earthen alcove; severed fingers, bloody teeth, 
flesh-encrusted nails, mutilated ears and stench-ridden innards. 
Large enough to hold perhaps a half-dozen people, this chamber 
reeks with numerous foul smells, the pungent scents of urine and 
feces the most powerful. A pair of rusted iron-manacles hangs 
from each wall, between the wooden support beams, save to the 
east, where a thick, iron-banded door opens outwards to a larger 
underground cavern. A small pit has been dug into the earth in 
the middle of this alcove, the dirt around it imprinted with 
numerous footprints, ranging from tiny, dainty toe marks to 
thick, broad stomps.

Large Stone Attic With Barred Windows~
   Hot, stale air lingers between the dark stone walls of the 
second floor of this large building. A row of gaps in the 
northern wall have been covered in thick planks of wood and iron 
bars, penning in the ragged-dressed slaves that gather about this 
area. Four rows of shabby, flea-infested bunk-beds run parallel 
to each other across this room, a number occupied by the sleeping 
forms of haggard humans. Heavy-set slavers move between the 
rows, barking sharp commands at any slave that lingers in their 
way. A map of cobwebs stretches out across the flat, stone 
ceiling, silently harvesting the occasional bug that flits 
through the attic. A rickety staircase set at the northern end 
of the room near the barred windows leads downward into the Slave 
Halls.

A Damp, Musty Smelling Cave~
   While cut from the rock and dirt in a similar fashion as the 
rest of the orkish warrens, this cave is rather unique. Water 
seeps in from somewhere above, trickling down the jagged rock 
walls and pooling in several places upon the stone floor. The 
water collects until it overflows into the northwestern section 
of the cave, where it slowly seeps down through several small 
cracks that delve more deeply into the earth. A narrow opening 
leads eastwards.

Large, Subterranean Cavern~
   The rough stone ceiling of this cavern reaches its apex far 
overhead, a colony of moss and fungi having laid claim to the 
upper slopes of the subterranean cave. The igneous rock slopes 
that form the walls of this area are set far apart, and stretch 
onwards to the south and the west. A large hole has been hacked 
out the eastern wall of stone, a wide, squat tunnel leading 
through the rock to another large cave. The black ground is 
roughly flat, and has been kept clear of clutter and debris in 
the center of the room. However, about the edges, any number of 
broken hilts, bloodied teeth and yellowed bones can be found 
amongst the refuse of tattered rags and leathers. The air is 
permeated with the stench of sweat, mingled with an aroma of 
acrid blood. 
   On the northern side of the cavern is a shallow descent to 
deeper into the underbelly of Minas Morgul.

Repugnant Cavern Alcove~
   The buzzing of flies and skittering movements of a horde of 
other insects never departs this foul-smelling room, these 
minuscule carnivores lured to this cavern alcove by the rotting, 
discarded entrails of creatures big and small that clutter the 
edges here. Grisly innards and skins of every description occupy 
much of the available space in this cave, some draped over stone 
ledges or crudely affixed to the igneous stone walls. Dark 
splotches and stains cover the floor, some of them ingrained in 
the very stone, while others tenaciously cling in blobs to those 
that move through the area. Northwards, the black walls of the 
alcove opens out to a larger cavern, a departure away from the 
repugnant stench of rotting flesh that dominates this cave.

Irregular Shaped Cave~
   Spanning outwards from a larger cavern lying to the west, this 
cave is a rough spherical shape, a coarse black stone forming the 
walls, ceiling and floor here. A small ledge of somewhat flat 
ground juts out a short distance of a half-dozen feet, before 
sloping down. Although far from level terrain, movement up and 
down the lower slopes of this irregular shaped cave is aided by 
the jagged nature of the stone, allowing one to find easy 
footholds and grips. A dark green moss lays claim to much of the 
cavern, gripping viscously to the earth it covers. A scattering 
of midden has been spread across the floor of the area, yet the 
collection of odd bones, scraps of food and rags serves little 
purpose save to lure and nourish bugs of all sorts.

Spacious Cavern With A Darkly Stained Rock Floor~
   The walls of this dome shaped portion of the underground 
orcish warrens are covered in all manners of dark stains, as is 
the cold stone floor that stretches from one edge of the area to 
the opposite. A series of weapon racks rings about the room, of 
poor construction, and a variety of broken blades and shattered 
shields lays strewn about the edges of the cavern. A passage 
leads to the west to a large, foul-smelling alcove within the 
warrens.

Cluttered Storage Space Carved Out From Rock~
   This large space has been roughly hacked from the stone 
underbelly on Minas Morgul, the crude marks of tools evident on 
the broad stone walls of this cavern. Various racks and shelves, 
constructed from mismatching pieces of wood, are haphazardly 
arranged about the area, bearing upon them numerous decrepit 
objects that are of little use to any. From the east, a narrow 
passage opens up onto a large space, the snores, grunts, and 
movements of many living things all sounds that drift from the 
barracks to this storage space.

About The Large Pit On A Narrow Trail~
   A narrow passage is cut through the stone, leading north and 
south to a larger cavern at either end, the southern branch of 
the trail covered in a rough curtain. A gaping pit lies off to 
the east of the trail, it's depths disguised by the darkness. A 
foul, rotting stench rises up from the pit, invasive to the 
nostrils, and flooding the path with a near corrosive odour. 
Mounted along the path, set against the western stone wall, is a 
series of squat iron braziers, plumes of acrid smoke rising from 
them, casting the area in a thin, hazy fog and detracting 
slightly from the stench. Heaps of bone, flesh and more grisly 
humanoid and animal remains rise out from the chasm, and a small 
ledge leads outwards a short distance over it, branching from 
midway along the trail. A loud buzzing sound echoes throughout 
the area, originating from the dank pit.

Small Alcove Filled With Gaudy Decorations~
   This small dirt chamber extends off into a number of alcoves 
hacked from the stone and adorned with numerous grisly trophies, 
a crude curtain thrown over each and a mass of furs arranged into 
pallets occupying each. The central area has little in the way 
of furnishings, barren except for the maze of cobwebs that 
stretches over the stone ceiling. To the north, a tattered piece 
of burlap hangs over the start of a trail leading through the 
cavern, a faint buzzing sound coming from that direction.

In The Air Over The Pit~
   Having left the confines of the narrow trail, you now quickly 
approach the bottom of the gruesome pit. The awful smell, 
generated from the offal and entrails splayed across the chasm, 
assaults your nostrils without remorse. Hard stone rises up to 
meet you as you fall freely through the air, towards the cavern 
floor, many a stalagmite jutting forth from the ground and 
presenting a possibly fatal landing site.

Bottom Of The Offal-Strewn Pit~
   From the rough, dark stone floor of this cavern rise up many a 
stalagmite, the ground uneven as it spreads from upwards sloping 
wall to wall. Slow drips of water rain down from the darkness 
concealed ceiling at lengthy, unpredictable intervals, the floor 
scattered with thin pools of brackish water. Yet, far more foul 
than this are the heaped piles of offal and all manner of 
humanoid and animal remains, scattered about the cave in a 
haphazard manner. Teeth, bones, limbs, skeletons, and entire 
bodies all rot and decay on the cold stone, a cloud of flies 
buzzing incessantly, the insidious sound of their wings 
assaulting the senses with equal force to the overpowering 
stench. The western wall ascends at a shallow pace, allowing one 
to clamber up it, with help of the various rocky outcroppings.

Minas Morgul Labor Yard~
   Large piles of battered masonry rise up in wobbling spires, 
heap upon heap of dark and light rock strewn across the ground. 
Progress through this massive yard is made across the mismatched 
pieces of masonry, the jagged edges posing a hazard to those that 
walk barefoot. Rats and insects crawl freely amongst the piles, 
many burrowed deep within the great mounds of broken rocks. To 
the east, a squat, squarish building rises up, much of the debris 
heaped against its walls. A small doorway leads inside the 
building, whilst in all other directions the thick stone walls of 
adjacent buildings confines one to the rubble-filled yard.

Sweltering Heat Of The Forge Room~
   The burning fires of the massive forge that dominates the 
centre of this room, bathing the area in a persistent, roasting 
heat at all hours of the day. The walls of this large cave look 
to have been recently cut out from the stone underbelly of Minas 
Morgul, but already a thick coating of black soot covers 
everything in the area. A stream of orcs and goblins, clad only 
in rags and the eye-socket patch on their shoulder, moves in and 
out of the area, working away at producing arms and armour for 
the clan. 
   To the south, stout bars and a firm lock cover a recently 
added extention of the cavern.

the floor covered in ripped remnants of wool and linen tunics, 
blood stained hides and furs, and stacks of straw wedged 
together. The roof slops down from the south, reaching down to 
the shoulders of a man by its stop at the northern end of the 
room, and covered in thick cobwebs all the way. To the south, an 
open archway opens out to another crowded room.

Subterrenean Bedchambers~
   This irregular shaped chamber has been cut out directly from 
the hard earth beneath the city of Minas Morgul, pale shoots of 
struggling plants poking from the walls of the dirt alcove. 
Bedding and furs line the cave as it reaches from the west to the 
east, sloping upwards to break through a stone ceiling and onto 
more bedchambers. The reek of animals is heavy in the air, no 
doubt emanating from the packs of goblins sleeping here.

Dismal Meeting Room~
   Water drips from the roof to the western side of this hand-dug 
dirt chamber, pooling to one side of the room in a puddle of 
stagnant liquid. Scraps of wood and metal clutter the edges of 
the room, twisted blades and beaten leathers mixed in with the 
general midden. To the east, a narrow passage through the dirt 
leads out to a chamber occupied by many sleeping goblinoid forms.

Cramped Cavern-Cage~
   Roomy enough to fit a few people within the cold, jagged walls 
of stone, but little else, the roughly oval shape of this cage 
cut off abruplty by a series of firm iron bars set across the 
north wall. Beyond these, the sweltering heat of a forgeroom can 
be seen, the dim lights revealing sweat-marked bodies of goblins 
and orcs, the sounds of metal upon metal and the smell of 
flesh-death easily filling this section of the cavern.

Shallow Dug Kitchen~
   This slanted room reaches its narrowest point on the northern 
side, shallowly dug into the dark rock deep beneath the Azun 
Gatekeep, but deepening enough to allow even the tallest of orcs 
to stand upright as the terrain runs south to end at a black 
stone wall. A small gate formed of iron bars is set there, and a 
larger cavern expands to the west, waves of heat rolling forth 
from that direction. An easy scrabble upwards to the north of 
the room allows one to ascend to a cooler portion of the cave.

Sweat Drenched Forge Room~
   A pack of rag-clad goblins, bodies drenched in sweat, moves 
constantly about the forge room, carrying coal, taking the shoves 
of large orkin and ensuring that the burning fires of the forge 
continue unabated. Large enough to hold a regiment of orcs, the 
reek of goblin sweat pervades the air here, and anyone lingering 
too long within the soot coated walls of this section of the 
cavern is bound to find themselves also marked by the black, ashy 
substance. The sounds of metal upon metal and the dim squeaks 
and growls of goblins echo about the area, a crude stone archway 
to the east allowing one an exit from the noise, heat and smells 
of the forge room.

Warm Cave Off The Main Cavern~
   Large enough to hold either goods or prisoners, this cavern is 
rather warm, the western rock wall especially so. The humid air 
is allowed to filter freely through the stout iron bars that form 
the gate covering the narrow northern entrance, yet there is no 
other exit from this space. A secure lock on the gate keeps it 
firmly in place.

Tiered Cavern Filled With Uruks~
   For an area filled with dark skinned orcs, this cavern is 
remarkably clean and well organised, a pack of rag-clad emaciated 
goblins moving to and fro about the jagged floor of the cave 
ensuring the passage ways between the numerous cells cut into the 
walls are kept clear. More often than not, these weedy tenders 
are kicked out of the way by the striding, scale-clad form of the 
towering uruks that roam the cavern, moving in and about the 
numerous levels that have been cut into the stone underbelly of 
Minas Morgul. Every orc seems to posses their own private 
chamber cut out from the stone, yet despite the orderly nature of 
this Uruk den the bestial barks of black-speech and orkish are 
loud, as is the smell of rotting food. To the north, the general 
clamour of the yrcish warrens is slighted muted by a gigantic, 
rounded oak door, a lightning bolt engraved on the centre of it.

A Convergence of Several Narrow Roads~
   A very narrow road begins just to the east, coming from Slave 
Road, and branches into two equally narrow roads, one headed to 
the west and one to the south. The back of a large, black stone 
building looms ominously to the north, a large amount of refuse 
stacked against it, something common to most of this area. The 
narrow streets are lined by haphazardly built, mostly rotten 
wooden hovels, many of which are literally at the point of 
collapse. Near the meeting of Slave Road with this narrow 
laneway, a small shack has been claimed by several of the local 
watchmen, who keep an eye on the street from within and without 
their building. A large volume of human traffic moves through 
these parts, from malnourished, loud children to impoverished 
mongrels, busily going about their business of survival in their 
sullen rags.

Many miserable looking humans huddle together for warmth in the 
various shacks lining the streets, their shelters leaking in so 
many places as to be almost as wet as the outdoors. A few 
unhappy people make dashes through the rain, on to whatever 
business to which they attend.

along the road, hurrying along to ends unknown. The smell of 
burning wood, and garbage, permeates the air in a most unpleasant

A Short Cul-de-sac in a Mongrel Ghetto~
   This very narrow street comes to an end here, its further 
expansion to the west halted by a rickety, crude building of some 
kind of rotting wood. The whole road expands into a small 
circle, a stone well in the center. To the north and west, 
behind the wooden buildings, are several black stone walled 
buildings, which cut off almost all sunlight to this section of 
the street. The buildings lining this street appear to be of a 
mostly residential nature, with a mass of ragged humans occupying 
them. The guard presence here is high, with armoured men 
wandering the streets at regular intervals.

A Street Through a Mongrel Ghetto~
   A narrow, shoddily paved street extends north and south, 
boarded by tall, crudely constructed wooden buildings which cast 
deep shadows over this street all day. Many different types of 
mongrel humans are present, some visible through windows, others 
making up the bulk of this road's considerable foot traffic. In 
the south-eastern part of this section of road, a tall brick wall 
impedes further movement, as well as blocking eastward vision.

A Downwards-Sloping Street Passing A Large Structure~
   The street begins to slope fairly steeply downward to the 
south here, the buildings by its side constructed with flimsy 
supports. The cobbled stone here is quite uneven, and one could 
easily trip if not paying strict attention, resulting in a nasty 
fall down the long hill. To the east, a large, though 
comparatively squat property sits behind a crude brick wall, with 
a rickety gate somewhere near its center. A constant trickle of 
human traffic moves through this area, with the occasional 
half-orc visible in the crowd.

A Twisting, Decrepit Road Declining Westward~
   The steadily declining road makes a twist towards the west 
here, beginning to pull up just a little. To the east, a 
decrepit building looks about ready to collapse in on itself, its 
crudely-thatched roof baring huge holes, and the rotten door 
looks like it could fall off of its hinges at any moment. Up a 
few poor quality stone steps to the south is another building, in 
somewhat better condition. A somewhat constant flow of human 
traffic moves through this area, with the occasional half-orc 
visible in the crowd.

   This incredibly small building seems to be some sort of 
business - the single room having been split down the middle by 
some sort of crudely constructed counter made from scrap wood. 
Behind the counter, several boxes overstuffed with merchandise 
can be seen by those tall enough. The foundations of the 
building appear to be crumbling in a most disconcerting fashion, 
small piles of masonry rubble can be observed around the 
westernmost corners, and the thatching on the roof is patchy at 
best.

The Base Of A Declining Road In A Mongrel Ghetto~
   The declining road from the east comes to a more or less 
horizontal end here, looking to have been cut out of the natural 
rock face that halts further passage to the north. The road here 
is in quite a state of disrepair, the cobbling is cracked and 
uneven at best. A large, multi-story building constructed of 
shabby masonry rises up to the south, the doorway missing 
whatever door once stood there. There is a fairly constant flow 
of grotty human traffic in both directions, unhappy people 
pushing, pulling, and carrying heavy loads up or down the rather 
steep road.

A Street Between A Wall And A Burnt Out Building~
   The road continues east and west past this point, with 
cobbling that has become cracked and uneven, bulging up in some 
random places and sagging in still others. Murky puddles of 
fetid water fill some of the lower points of the road, creating 
unpleasant footfalls for the unwary traveler. A massive granite 
rock wall looms to the north, sporting the backs of numerous 
shabby buildings: The unlucky may occasionally be hit by buckets 
of swill and waste being ejected from their back windows. To the 
south the burnt out remains of what was once a large building can 
be seen. The occasional human or half-orc can be seen scuttering 
past this location, on the way to somewhere else.

The Hollowed Out Shell Of A Fire-Gutted Building~

rather large wooden building are here. The stone foundations 
have collapsed on themselves, several piles of masonry rubble 
lying about in haphazard piles. An incredibly unstable looking 
section of the second story remains uncollapsed, hanging 
precariously with very little support. Further progress to the

A Large, Open-Plan Building Of Shabby Masonry~
   The floor of this room is merely a packed dirt ground, 
however, the walls are constructed of some sort of granite 
masonry, albeit shabbily. The roof is not a great deal higher 
than a tall man, which combined with the fairly large length and 
breadth of this room gives it a rather odd feeling of 
confinement. All the windows have been boarded up with sturdy 
planks of wood, which look to have been stolen in some places 
from the corner supports. A fairly decrepit and unstable looking 
staircase can be found in the southeastern corner, leading up 
into the the next story up. When there is much movement on the 
story above, large clouds of dust and plaster momentarily choke 
this room. A fairly large volume of ragtag, downtrodden humans 
and half-orcs mill about around here, seemingly squatting.

the general atmosphere of this place is one of intense despair.

The End Of A Low Street In A Mongrel Ghetto~
   Running in from the east, the street comes to an end here - 
culminating in what might have been a square if the street wasn't 
already so narrow and the buildings so crowded. In all three 
cardinal directions except east, sheer walls of dark rock create 
stark walls, giving this little corner of Minas Morgul an 
incredibly claustrophobic feel. The stone of the northern face 
is a little lighter in color, granite most probably, and it seems 
that a doorway has been carved into it, with a heavy iron door 
inside. An old, rotten looking building looms to the west, and a 
modest building of mixed stone and wood can be seen to the south, 
a wooden sign hanging above the door with a crude painting of a 
pot on it. There are some few mongrels to be seen going about 
their business around this place.

already so narrow and the buildings so crowded. Dark, obelisk 
like mountains of pitch black rock tower above this place in more 
or less every direction, allowing just a small section of the 
night sky to be visible. This area has an exceptionally eerie 
feel as dark shapes and shadows flicker across the various 
surfaces. Several small fires can be seen casting a warm glow 
through the windows of the southern and western buildings, 
creating the little light that is present here. Dark, shadowy 
figures scuttle back and forth, occasionally entering or exiting 
through the heavy barred iron door to the north.

granite of the walls. The ceiling is rather low, just over the 
heads of a tall man, and is not entirely even - creating hazards 
for taller patrons to hit their heads on if they are unwary. A 
single fire, contained inside a grilled metal boiler in the 
center of the room provides all the light for this establishment, 
which is decidedly little. A counter made of the same granite as 
the walls, though not physically a part of them spans the length 
of the end of the cavern opposite the entrance, which serves as 
the bar for serving food and drinks. Behind that is a makeshift 
wooden dividing wall, creating an area where the goods are 
stored. The many tables are most occupying the western and 
central part of the room, arranged in a fairly tight fashion that 
occasionally creates lanes which cannot be passed by on the way 
to another table. In the eastern part of the room, an incredibly 
unsteady looking staircase leads up into a hole carved in the 
roof. The establishment is absoloutely packed with rough, ragged 
looking patrons of varying races.

A Small Oddities Shop~
   Inside this small building of salvaged wood and straw 
thatching is what looks to be some kind of shop, stocking all 
kinds of wares from the marginally useful to the downright 
bizarre. Neat, tidy display shelves sit about the store, 
creating an illusion of order that is quickly dispelled by anyone 
that attempts to browse said shelves for wares - they appear 
totally devoid of any kind of logical arrangement, which makes 
for confusing shopping. What would once have been a completely 
boarded floor has been broken and even removed in places, 
creating a nasty maze of snags for the improperly shoed shopper. 
A small number of racially mixed clientele generally browse this 
store at any given time.

A Cramped, Rotten-Wood Dwelling~
   This old wooden building seems to be rotten on the inside, 
some of the inner walls and - disturbingly - the roof's supports 
seem to have already begun falling apart from their inner 
weakness. What little light this room receives comes directly 
through large open holes in the roof, creating a patchy and 
uneven light. The rotten wood, in addition to the squalor and 
refuse scattered about this dwelling creates a powerful sense of 
poverty and desperation, which is only multiplied by the 
emaciated, filthy squatters that make this retched place their 
home.

even receiving the usual level of nighttime ambience. What 
little light is in this room comes directly through the gaping 
holes in the roof, cast by the stars in the night sky. There are 
a good few filthy humans huddled together on mounds of refuse, 
trying to stay warm and get some sleep.

Woodun' Things An' Stuff~
   This is the west wing of a large, stone-wrought structure, 
which looks to have been a favor for a blackblood compared to the 
other caves around here. Many wooden crates are stacked up 
behind, and about the counter, full of the wares of this store. 
Some select items have been put out on various display cases 
about the store, but the vast bulk of the wares seem to be 
contained in the crates. There is a reasonable volume of 
patronage at all times of the day and night, this place never 
truly quiet. A heavy woolen curtain separates the two sections 
of the store.

A Small Austere Room~
   This small austere, stone room is almost cave like. It is 
cramped damp, and generally unpleasant. The smell of sweat is 
strong and combined with the disorder of the dank stone walls 
lends a distasteful atmosphere to the room. Protruding from the 
stained, stone walls, a rusted iron ring holds a torch throwing 
harsh, dim, smoky light across the cold room. There are no 
windows of any kind, and other than the torch, the only thing to 
be seen in the walls is the thick, though very likely internally 
rotten door leading out.

   The floor boards creak as one walks along this long, dim hall. 
Shabby, dirty denizens of various races pass by in the dark 
corridor. On either side of the hall, doors line the dank stone 
walls. Unpainted, warped, planks of some grayed, unrecognizable 
wood pass as the doors. Scratched into each door is a mark, 
matching the rusty iron key that open it, though it almost hardly 
seems necessary as these doors look like they could be kicked in 
even by a fairly feeble assailant. At the far end of the filthy 
hall, a slit in the stone looks out over the cobbled street in 
the ghetto, casting meager and uneven light throughout the damp, 
smelling hall.

A Cluttered, Dilapidated Cave Decorated in a Tasteless Fashion~
   This cave is obviously the dwelling of some extremely foul and 
loathsome creatures. Uneaten remnants of maggot-infested animal 
parts lie strewn about this place. The cave itself is decorated, 
if one could call it that, in a series of uncomplimentary and 
randomly-coloured strands and ripped fragments of cloth, with a 
few straw piles constituting some type of bedding. Bones lie in 
a large pile in a corner, flies and other insects swarming about, 
attempting to salvage some sustenance from the abhorrent scraps. 
Though most of the bones seem to be of animal origin, several 
seemed to belong at one time to a humanoid creature of some sort. 
A wide tunnel recently cut out from the western wall leads 
onwards into another decrepit cavern.

A Hollow, Recently Dug Chamber~
   This chamber appears to have been carved recently from the 
thick, surrounding rock. A heavy stench of orc lingers over the 
place that would offend any creature of a daintier taste. 
Tattered banners bearing poorly sewn skulls hang from the walls, 
while at the back of the room stands a dais of sorts, upon which 
sits a crude throne carved of rotting wood. Piled beneath the 
throne lie human skulls in a path leading out of the room, some 
still fresh with blood, or gore that has yet to have been licked 
away by a passing orc.

Large, Subterranean Cavern~
   The rough stone ceiling of this cavern reaches its apex far 
overhead, a colony of moss and fungi having laid claim to the 
upper slopes of the subterranean cave. The igneous rock slopes 
that form the walls of this area are set far apart, and stretch 
onwards to the south and the west. A large hole has been hacked 
out the eastern wall of stone, a wide, squat tunnel leading 
through the rock to another large cave. The black ground is 
roughly flat, and has been kept clear of clutter and debris in 
the center of the room. However, about the edges, any number of 
broken hilts, bloodied teeth and yellowed bones can be found 
amongst the refuse of tattered rags and leathers. The air is 
permeated with the stench of sweat, mingled with an aroma of 
acrid blood. 
   On the northern side of the cavern is a shallow descent to 
deeper into the underbelly of Minas Morgul.

Repugnant Cavern Alcove~
   The buzzing of flies and skittering movements of a horde of 
other insects never departs this foul-smelling room, these 
minuscule carnivores lured to this cavern alcove by the rotting, 
discarded entrails of creatures big and small that clutter the 
edges here. Grisly innards and skins of every description occupy 
much of the available space in this cave, some draped over stone 
ledges or crudely affixed to the igneous stone walls. Dark 
splotches and stains cover the floor, some of them ingrained in 
the very stone, while others tenaciously cling in blobs to those 
that move through the area. Northwards, the black walls of the 
alcove opens out to a larger cavern, a departure away from the 
repugnant stench of rotting flesh that dominates this cave.

Irregular Shaped Cave~
   Spanning outwards from a larger cavern lying to the west, this 
cave is a rough spherical shape, a coarse black stone forming the 
walls, ceiling and floor here. A small ledge of somewhat flat 
ground juts out a short distance of a half-dozen feet, before 
sloping down. Although far from level terrain, movement up and 
down the lower slopes of this irregular shaped cave is aided by 
the jagged nature of the stone, allowing one to find easy 
footholds and grips. A dark green moss lays claim to much of the 
cavern, gripping viscously to the earth it covers. A scattering 
of midden has been spread across the floor of the area, yet the 
collection of odd bones, scraps of food and rags serves little 
purpose save to lure and nourish bugs of all sorts.

A Wide Cave Claimed by the Bedding of Many Creatures~
   This cave seems to be meant for slumber, though only foul 
creatures would rest in such disgusting filth. Bedding of some 
sort, primarily consisting of rough patches of straw and harsh, 
coarse cloth, dominates this place, where literally a hundred 
creatures could squeeze in their malicious bodies to rest in this 
fetid hole. A sickening stench can faintly be sensed coming from 
the north, and a tunnel of some sort is barely discernible to the 
east. Blood and other uneaten refuse from unknown animals can be 
viewed upon the floor, numerous insects and maggots feasting on 
the scraps in a grotesque and disturbing scene.

A Dark Tunnel with a Foul Smell Wafting in from Below~
   This tunnel is wet, moist and very unpleasant. It is littered 
with refuse scraps of food, and in some places excrement of 
extremely foul and unsanitary creatures. Flies permeate 
throughout the air, and seem to envelop this place within a 
deafening, buzzing swarm. A repugnant and nauseating aroma reeks 
upward from below in strong, wispy currents, and seems to smell 
of rotting feces and other dirty, virulent substances. The 
tunnel continues southward, and also plunges downward into 
unspeakable depths, and rather disagreeable ones considering the 
repulsive stench that is emitted from its horrific bowels.

A Damp, Musty Smelling Cave~
   While cut from the rock and dirt in a similar fashion as the 
rest of the orkish warrens, this cave is rather unique. Water 
seeps in from somewhere above, trickling down the jagged rock 
walls and pooling in several places upon the stone floor. The 
water collects until it overflows into the northwestern section 
of the cave, where it slowly seeps down through several small 
cracks that delve more deeply into the earth. A narrow opening 
leads eastwards.

Sweat Drenched Forge Room~
   A pack of rag-clad goblins, bodies drenched in sweat, moves 
constantly about the forge room, carrying coal, taking the shoves 
of large orkin and ensuring that the burning fires of the forge 
continue unabated. Large enough to hold a regiment of orcs, the 
reek of goblin sweat pervades the air here, and anyone lingering 
too long within the soot coated walls of this section of the 
cavern is bound to find themselves also marked by the black, ashy 
substance. The sounds of metal upon metal and the dim squeaks 
and growls of goblins echo about the area, a crude stone archway 
to the east allowing one an exit from the noise, heat and smells 
of the forge room.

   This slanted room reaches its narrowest point on the northern 
side, shallowly dug into the dark rock deep beneath the Azun 
Gatekeep, but deepening enough to allow even the tallest of orcs 
to stand upright as the terrain runs south to end at a black 
stone wall. A small gate formed of iron bars is set there, and a 
larger cavern expands to the west, waves of heat rolling forth 
from that direction. An easy scrabble upwards to the north of 
the room allows one to ascend to a cooler portion of the cave.

   The utterly putrid air of this tightly-enclosed chamber is 
almost enough to knock someone unconscious upon entering. A deep 
cesspit takes up the majority of its floor, with only a narrow 
strip of solid ground circling its perimeter. The pool is filled 
with a viscous, rank-smelling liquid that lies completely 
motionless, its surface broken only by the occasional slow-rising 
bubble that bursts to release a cloud of sulphuric gas.

A Cavernous Tunnel Strewn with Pads of Fur and Rough Cloth~
   The tunnel widens and narrows arbitrarily as it proceeds along 
in an eastward and westward fashion. An alcove branches out to 
the south, with a sickening smell originating from that 
direction. Lying crumpled in heaps about the sides of this 
tunnel are the hides and fur of wolves, bears, wargs, and other 
creatures. A few scraps of ripped and torn cloth are also strewn 
about, as if this place was meant for some sort of derobing 
ritual, though the validity of this thought cannot be determined. 
The roughly-cut tunnel meanders on through the darkness, its dark 
basalt walls looming forebodingly on either side.

A Claustrophobic, Gore-Splattered Chamber~
   This small chamber, no more than eight feet high, and perhaps 
thirty feet in length and breadth, those prone to feelings of 
claustrophobia would be rather uncomfortable in here - not that 
those who don't would be any more comfortable; the air is 
incredibly hot, humid and muggy, and an unidentifiable, wholly 
foul smell overwhelms the scent of all who dwell here. The walls 
are coated in dripping wet gore, and other strange fluids, and 
the floor is spongy underfoot and sporting an ankle high pool of 
a black, viscous fluid. An absoloutely puzzling disorientation 
of the spatial senses is in effect here, and if it were not for 
the ground's pool of liquid, you would not be entirely certain of 
which direction is down. Not a very pleasant place to be by any 
stretch of the imagination.

unabated, making this room rather well lit. The remaining parts

A Wide Stone Workroom~
   Cut into the stone of the mountain, this wide room has been 
set up as a workroom of sorts. It smells heavily of tanning 
leather, sweat, and smoke, and the floor is littered with scraps 
of projects. Leather, wood shavings, bits of metal, and 
countless other debris is piled in the corners, beneath the 
furniture, parted only by a series of paths that allow navigation 
of the mess. 
   To the east, the stone floor slopes upward into another room, 
from which emanates quite a bit of heat. A door stands to the 
north, set into the stone.

A Stiflingly Hot Forge Room~
   Waves of blistering heat come from the forge and furnace here, 
filling the room with stiflingly heavy smoke that filters up 
through a crack in the ceiling. This room has been cut into the 
rock, the marks of a pick visible on the walls. Various scraps 
of metal are strewn about, but otherwise the area is simple and 
functional in design. The ground slops downward to the west, 
where the heat diminishes as well.

A Tiny, Rickety Market Stall~
   With barely enough room for two normal-sized people to stand 
shoulder to shoulder here, this tiny stall is cluttered with 
junk. Little more than three wooden walls and an oiled leather 
tarp overhead, items of all descriptions line the walls and are 
piled in the cramped area behind the small counter that divides 
the stall in two. A stool occupies what little cleared space 
there is behind the counter, allowing the shopkeep to sit while 
working.

A Sunken, Flooded Cellar~
   This underground cellar seems to have escaped the worst of the 
fire from the building above, with just a few scorch marks 
visible around the trapdoor above. It is likely that even if the 
fire had caught down here, it wouldn't have made much difference, 
as it appears to have been carved out of the very bedrock of the 
area. The entire cellar seems to have flooded, to a height where 
a goblin would have difficulty keeping their head out. The water 
is thick and viscous, mixed to saturation point and beyond with 
ash, debris, algae and other muck, and resists movement through 
it with surprising force, being more of a sludge than a body of 
water. The floor appears to be made of whatever of this silt 
that has settled upon the floor, however, there is a deep drop 
off somewhere towards the center of the room.

Storeroom for mobile 5181, Lira the flower seller. No shop.~
   She is submissive, shy, and thouroughly used to being abused. 
She would barely flinch if she was tortured by the best of 
Numenorian masters, just accept it. However, the locals wouldn't 
take kindly to that, they all have a soft spot for the quiet, 
dirty but beautiful girl that sells wilted flowers.

The Inside of a Crudely-Built Wooden Shack~
   This rickety old shack does not look like a particularly 
inviting place, being made by a mediocrely skilled person working 
with very limited, pilfered materials. This individual shack 
however is lucky enough to have a wooden floor, albeit a very 
uneven one, the wood warped in odd directions. It looks as if 
there were once windows on the eastern and western sides of this 
shack, but that they have been boarded up with the same 
haphazardly acquired materials as the walls. In addition to the 
heavy eastern door, there is a crude, much thinner door that 
looks like it was stolen whole from somewhere else. It bears the 
marks of several acts of attempted break-in, and the flimsy lock 
has been completely bent backwards, such that it will no longer 
close.

   The roof of this rickety old shack fails to keep out much of 
the currently falling rain, trickling through in some places and 
practically gushing in others. The patchy, mediocrely made roof 
provides very few areas of refuge from the water. The water 
seems to be sinking into the floorboards, bringing out the fetid 
smell of the fact that they are inwardly rotten. It looks as if

the floorboards, or pool in odd places flows out under the 
eastern door. From under a gap in the western door, a liberal 
quantity of mud flows in from the yard, slowly seeping its way 
across the floor. This is currently an incredibly cold, wet, and 
miserable place.

This door has been pieced together in a patchy and crude fashion from many 
different planks of wood, and is fundamentally unsound structurally. It is
heavy, bulky, and there are many rusty nails for one to snag themselves 
upon. A heavy iron lock that still has some small amount of masonry 
attached from wherever it was pilfered from has been bolted to the door, 
providing a lock.

A Dingy, Wet Hollow Beneath a Wooden Floor~
   This looks to be a natural recess that just so happens to have 
had a shack built over the top of it, although certain parts of 
it appear to have been extended by chipping and scratching. It 
is dank, musty, and smells foul and horrible. A thick, slimy 
moss seems to have grown upon the floor and walls of this recess, 
and the underside of the floorboards above are rotten and 
infested with mildew and other manners of fungii.

A Narrow Street Diverging from Slaver's Road~
   Between several tall stone buildings, this narrow street runs 
fairly straight east and west, seeming to lead out onto a large 
road to the east. The buildings do not appear to have any kind 
of access to the roads, with only second story or higher windows 
with bars and shutters on them. The whole area smells incredibly 
potent, a mixture of dung, refuse and human sweat, and the thin 
street has more sullen faced mongrel humans than it should 
rightly handle. Every so often, a cart, or a division of Black 
Watchmen will pass through this area and force everyone else up 
against the walls until they pass. The sky is only visible in a 
long, thin strip directly up, and this area tends to be dimly lit 
at all times.

A Cramped Makeshift Yard Behind a Wooden Shack~
   This small space could not be more than fifteen feet in any 
direction, being bordered on the north and south sides by tall 
wooden buildings, and cut off by a sheer granite rock face to the 
west. The ground is mostly a very silty grey dirt, but in 
certain areas the remnants of wooden foundations can be seen, 
evidence of a structure having previously been here but being 
torn down or stolen or having met some other permanent end. It 
does provide some privacy, however any person in the north or 
south buildings could see into the yard if they peered through 
the boarded windows. There is a door to the east, warped and 
ill-fitting for its frame, which looks out of place, as if it had 
been lifted whole from someplace else.

In a Dusty Attic~
   This small, cramped room is choked with dust, looking rather 
disused and untended. The roof consists of a light 

wooden frame of some description, held up at regular intervals 
with rickety and half-rotten pillars of a solid wood. The frame 
is thatched with a musty, old straw mixed with a clay cement. 
There are no windows, and the trapdoor that leads down to the 
building below seems to have been heavily reinforced from the 
other side. Other than a good many rat droppings, insect 
carcasses and a breathtaking volume of dust, there is nothing to 
speak of in this room.

moth-eaten old rug has been hung up awkwardly on one of the stone 
walls, facing the doorway, the pattern long since faded and worn 
and graying.

A Musty Cellar~
   A sturdy wooden ladder leads down to this surprisingly large 
cellar, dug out beneath the cluttered storeroom. Musty, with a 
faintly earthy smell pervading everything, this cellar has an 
uneven, wooden floor, several of the floorboards coming loose. 
The trapdoor above the sturdy wooden ladder is made of thick oak 
and a rusty iron ring has been attached to its center. The walls 
are stone, but dirt and grime has caked them over the years and 
bits of dead leaves are stuck between stone blocks. A short 
length of iron chain has been set into one of the stone blocks, 
near a particularly loose floorboard in one corner of the room, 
and a steady drip in the same corner stains the dirt-caked wall 
darker.

Atop a Thatched Roof~
   The thatching on this roof seems to be fairly well made, 
considering the area, and is relatively fresh. The roof is set 
at a shallow angle, and is reasonably large. It would, however, 
be relatively easy to fall if one was not careful, and there 
tends to be a stiff breeze up here, with no great deal of 
buildings at this height to shield the wind from it. There is a 
brick structure near the middle of the roof that appears to have 
once been a chimney, though it has now fallen into extreme 
disrepair.

A Disused Room in a Large Building~
   This is a room, maybe twenty feet by forty, and it does not 
appear to have been used in a while. A thick layer of dust 
covers the ground, the only patterns disturbing it seem to be 
those of insects and small rodents, of which there are a rather 
few. There are no windows, and the only light comes from the 
chimney, which seems to be crumbling over time. There may have 
once been a fireplace at the bottom of the chimney but it is gone 
now, and so is its masonry. There are several large poles that 
support the roof, placed at even intervals, and there is a door 
in the southern side of the room, against one of the short ends.

A Dank, Foul-Smelling Hallway~
   This seems to be some kind of narrow hallway, dark, dank, and 
generally foul to be in. The floor seems to be made of some kind 
of compacted hay lain over the top of wood, and has gone rather 
rotten, but that's probably the most pleasant smell in this 
entire hall. Other smells, such as the deep, inlaid smell of 
sweat and a smell that is vaguely like a butcher's workshop can 
be picked up by even the least sensitive nose. There is a 
staircase at the end of the hall, however it seems to have 
collapsed in on itself and there is a rather long drop to the 
room below. There are also two doors, one at the northern end of 
the hall and one in the eastern wall.

by carts or slaves. Orcs wander about here going about their 
daily lives, to whatever low and pointless end that might come 
to. Expansive tunnels stretch east and west of here.

A Grand Cavern Surrounding and Underground Pool~
   This underground chamber reaches high and wide, opening into 
truly grand, cathedral-like proportions. Moisture glistens on 
the walls, and a perpetual drip-drip sound coming from multiple 
places breaks the calm silence of this place. The floor is 
uneven, rising and dipping frequently in smooth curves, the wavy 
feeling accented by the marble-like texture of the rock. Water 
runs from the walls towards the center in numerous thin rivules, 
snaking its way laboriously towards a central pool. 
   A large slab of dark rock sits at the northern end of the 
cavern, jagged and craggy. A narrow tunnel leads south, the only 
exit from this dark place.
