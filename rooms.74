Grassy Slope of the Anduin~
   The farmlands of South Ithilien come to a gradual end as the
ground slips beneath the brisk waters of the River Anduin west,
the lands about the riverbank clear of any cultivation and home 
to nothing more than a flourishing of shoreside trees and tall 
grasses. Just as the terrain slopes down from east to west, so
does it fall gradually from the distant white plateau of Emyn
Arnen north to a ford of rivers southward.

Shore of the River Anduin~
   West, the waters of the River Anduin run, far from the 
frenzied rush from which the currents surge to the north, but 
still fast enough to easily drag under all but the greatest of
swimmers. The shore here of loose dirt descends slowly under the
cold flow, the occasional coniferous tree sprouting out along the
riverbank or large rock rising out a short distance in the water.
The opposite bank of the river lies far to the west, barely 
visible against the course of the river.

Farmlands Bordered North and East by Forest~
   While the eastern horizon is dominated by the bleak peaks of 
the Ephel Duath that rise above the thin woodlands and barren 
plains of South Ithilien, here, vibrant crops grow year round, 
tended by the peasantry of Gondor that works the fields under the 
watchful shadow of the southwest-ward orc-inhabited stony bluff. 
Spread between the fields and pastures is the occasional 
green-watered dam.

Fertile, Rolling Hills~
   The normal rolling landscape of South Ithilien smooths to a 
flat, fertile stretch of land, occupied by hardworking farmers 
that have made numerous cottages to live in as they tend the rows 
of crops that grow in plentifully here. During the night, the 
only lights are those that twinkle in the distant orc-inhabited 
stony bluff that sits above the fief, to the southeast.

   A crude battlements have been carved out of the dark, greyish 
stony bluff that dominates South Ithilien here. Dark, ragged 
flags of human flesh and totems of bone decorated with chimes of 
stripped knuckles have been speared in to the flat, plateau-top 
of the rock, the grisly totems clattering and spinning whenever a 
breeze picks up. A rough rim of stone, waist high, runs along 
the outside of the bluff, granting a commanding view of the drab,

Top of the Orkish Fort~
   The flat top of the rocky bluff colonised by orcs and goblins 
is decorated with numerous totems and flags of human skin, skulls 
of various animals and humanoids rammed through spears, decaying 
corpses being attacked by scavenger birds, and all other manner 
of grisly, gruesome trophies. The rock underfoot is pocked and 
uneven, the stone of a dark greyish hue and somewhat cracked 
towards the centre of the area. Four narrow carved paths lead 
down to the waist-height parapet that runs about the edge of the 
fort-bluff.

Rolling Hills East of a White Cliff~
   Rolling hills extend in every direction, covered in thick 
grasses which range from two to four feet in height. The land 
has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so far fought off any 
attempts to cultivate it, though the local wildlife has worn 
narrow tracks which allow passage through the more thickly 
vegetated areas. The light brown earth is only visible in areas 
where an ancient trickle of water may have once carved a ravine 
in ages past. 
   To the west, the chalky-white plateau of Emyn Arnen rises 
above South Ithilien.

Patchy, Scrub-Dotted Hills ~
   The ground here is rather arid, dotted with small, green and 
brown shrubs and a mixture of yellow and pale-green grasses. 
Travel is made easy by the hardened earth, though there is 
neither sign of civilization, nor any reason for one to travel 
here apparent. The lands to the north seem greener, while 
rolling hills raise out from the ground to the west.

North and South Along a Path ~
   To the north and south the Harad Road continues on its course 
through the hills and plains of this land. To the south, the 
road enters a twisting ravine between steep, loose dirt and rock 
hillsides. The road itself, is merely a trail of packed dirt 
that has been worn down over the centuries into a small ditch 
compared to the land immediately to either side of the road. 
Hills mainly comprise the land around the road here.

Overgrown Grassy Fields East of a Trail~
   The broad fields of South Ithilien are wild and overgrown, 
tall grasses and scrabble bushes growing in the wide, windswept 
plains untamed by the hands of men. The ground is hard 
underfoot, and interspersed with more than the occasional rock, 
great boulders piled up on small rises of land every so often. 
The area is devoid of wildlife, the ominous presence of the 
black, shard like mountains of the Ephel Duath casting a dour 
atmosphere over the landscape.

Vast Foothills Coated In Dead Grass~
   A thick growth of low lying bushes roams across the hills of 
South Ithilien that lie between the low lying plains to the west 
and the steep, thrusting, presence of the eastward mountains. 
Small animal life darts amongst the clustered clumps of 
vegetation, as well as the occasional larger predator lurking far 
from the distant plateau to the northwest, or the forest 
westward.

A Steep, Windy Plateau of Jagged Rock ~
   The stark range of the Ephel Duath roams from north to south 
here, this land a bumpy, rocky spit of land situated before the 
steep ascent of the mountains to the east and the softer, greener 
hillands of South Ithilien to the west. The only life to be seen 
here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make their homes 
in the craggy lips and caves visible on the surface of the dark 
mountains.

Rock Strewn Hills East of the Emyn Arnen~
   The land about this area is quite hilly and occasionally 
broken in small cliffs. Rocks and boulders break through the 
healthy undergrowth of the land which comprises mostly small 
shrubs and bushes which only come to the height of a mans shin 
and occasionally to his knee. The wind blows among the hills and 
strange echoes can be heard at times as the wind blows around the 
rocks. 
   To the west, the chalky-white plateau of Emyn Arnen rises 
above South Ithilien.

   Here, the ancient forces of wind and rain have caused the 
collapse of one side of a grassy hill. The wild, tough grasses 
of the area have yet to tame the resultant gash of earth that 
shows like a wound in an otherwise grassy sea. However, they 
have conquered the rest of the softly undulating ground here, and 
the vegetation resists the legs of the passing traveler just as 
the hills tax them.

Spare Foothills of the Ephel Duath Mountains~

falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that 
spurts forth from the ground and is accompanied by a clustering 
of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
fields of South Ithilien westward, to the mighty, stark mountain 
face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

A Scrub-Dotted Field~
   Barren describes the wind blown landscape here well, the dark 
soil hard underfoot and the vegetation that grows being scrubby 
and wiry bushes, and some stretches of pale grass that bows in 
the wind. More often than not, great gusts of air blow down from 
the distant wall of mountains that lie to the east, the mighty 
Ephel Duath, blotting out the dawn sun.

   The towering, expansive mountain range grants the hard rock 
ground here a permanent shadow until past the noon of the day, 
the massive formation of volcanic rock blotting out the eastern 
horizon and the dark lands of Mordor that lies beneath. To the 
west, the fairer lands of South Ithilien can be seen, the terrain 
sloping downwards in that direction to finally end at a vast 
woodlands and a river.

Sparse, Rocky Woodland Beneath Tall Cliffs ~
   The sheer, chalk-white cliff walls of the Emyn Arnen jut out 
far above South Ithilien just a short distance to the north, and 
here the land descends rapidly as it heads south in a series of 
rocky, bumpy falls, headed straight in to a thin forest of 
spruces, cedars and firs. Amidst the rocky ground, the 
occasional knot of trees grows high in the chill, mountain air, 
as can be seen the odd large animal track.

Travel is made easy by the hardened earth, though there is 
neither sign of civilization, nor any reason for one to travel 
here apparent. The lands to the north seem greener, while 
rolling hills raise out from the ground to the west.

A Foggy Evergreen Wood~
   A grey fog lays still upon the woodland floor, stirring only 
with the passage of infrequent travelers. The light of the sun 
filters dimly through the scraggly tops of the evergreens, 
drawing white streaks through the shadowy mist below. The 
undergrowth is sparse, consisting of thin, reddish-brown grasses 
growing knee-high in the heavy shadowy air. The trees are quite 
tall, their thin trunks straight and dark, slick with moisture 
from the fog. No branches grow upon them except at the very top, 
and the trees grow closely together.

Tall Conifers in a Foggy Wood~
   The densely packed trunks of trees draw black vertical lines 
through a muted fog, their sparse top branches covered with long 
green needles. Red-brown grass covers the ground in thin patchy 
sections, growing knee high on an average man, round stalks 
fanning out at the top into cloudy arrays seeking in vain for 
sunlight. The air hangs heavy beneath the evergreens, as if the 
wood holds its breath. There is no sound of birdsong or any 
rustling of small animals about, nor even drone of insects.

heavy air beneath is laced with fog and silence; nothing stirs 
but that disturbed by the rare passerby. The sparse, red-brown 
grass grows in sickly patches underfoot, moisture glistening on 
the blades. Sunlight seems as if it is consciously held back by 
the fog and the branches above, pushing through in murky streaks.

heavily here, the sounds of the traveler stepping through the 
feeble red-brown grass are shockingly loud.

Twisting Path Leading North and West~
   The dusty path of the Harad road continues north and west here 
through South Ithilien, little more than a narrow depression of 
land, as if once an ancient river ran along this course. To the 
east of the road, bleak plains and distant mountains rise up, 
while the western edge is bordered by a thin woodland. Long 
wagon ruts form the boundaries of this haphazard road. 
   
   A log cabin has recently been built off to the side of the 
road, providing temporary shelter and a means of communications 
for travelers.

Eerie Shrouded Wood~
   The fog presses in upon the rare traveler who ventures here, 
weighted down with silence. Slender black trunks stretch up 
straight and tall, branchless until the very top, where weak 
twisted arms sparsely adorned with long thin needles crawl across 
the sky, inextricably intertwined with those of neighboring 
trees. The rough bark of the closely-spaced trees is slick with 
moisture, and reddish-brown patches of sparse grass struggle for 
survival on the shadowed floor of the wood.

   Thick slabs of oozing disc-shaped fungus jut from the bark of 
one twisted trunk in a wood of otherwise unmarred straight 
slender trunks. An unpleasant scent is present near this one 
tree, adding to the oppressive atmosphere in the fog-darkened, 
heavy air beneath the tall evergreens. The marked silence of 
this wood is startling, for there is no rattling of small animals 
foraging, nor birdsong, nor even the sound of insects. There is 
only the wood, and the fog.

trunks rise, slender and black, straight and tall up through the 
fog, their rough bark glistening with moisture. Silence lays 
heavily here, the sounds of the traveler stepping through the 
feeble red-brown grass are shockingly loud.

In The Foul-Smelling Swamp~
   Inky black water, thick with mud and other foul substances, 
oozes forth from the slippery bank of slick earth from the west. 
No current pushes the water, instead its surface is like a flat 
of black glass, save until movement in the dank liquid sends 
spreading ripples across it. Ever present in the air is a 
dismal, diminishing stillness, the bleak colours and shapes of 
the swamp at times seemingly smothering. The waters continue to 
east and south. 
   The mighty mountain range of the Emyn Muil lie to the north,
the northern border of the marsh as the outlying hills quickly
rise up from the dark depths.

Muddy Water Bordering a Path to the South and East~
   Still water spreads silently throughout the area here, 
reaching up to the waist of a full grown man in some places. The 
ground beneath the pitch black surface is far from flat, instead 
rising and falling with little order or pattern. Regardless of 
the depth, the thick mud clings to anything that touches it, and 
many strange shapes brush against ones legs and feet when moving 
through these turgid waters. To the west the water continues on, 
while a sharp incline lies to south and east. 
   The mighty mountain range of the Emyn Muil lie to the north,
the northern border of the marsh as the outlying hills quickly
rise up from the dark depths.

Sodden Landscape~
   Tufts of hard, brown grass and small, grey plants shoot out of
the soft ground of the north Ithilien, the roaming heath
seemingly abandoned by all things living. The occasional great
tree lays strangled by lichen, bowed down under the weight of
years, and on the occasionally hillock of hard land heaps of
rotted wood and stone can be seen. In all directions the bog
continues, distant mountains visible to the north and east, their
peaks capped with snow.

Hilly Woodlands~
   The sky can be seen filtering through the branches of the 
trees in this woodland area. The trees are tall and though some 
seem to be dying others are full of life. Animals can be heard 
scurrying through the undergrowth occasionally and the wind 
rustles the leaves of the trees. Small shrubs grow everywhere 
and occasionally a rock pokes through the undergrowth.

Hilly Land North and West of a Trail ~
   Rolling hills extend in every direction, covered in thick 
grasses which range from two to four feet in height. The land 
has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so far fought off any 
attempts to cultivate it, though the local wildlife has worn 
narrow tracks which allow passage through the more thickly 
vegetated areas. The light brown earth is only visible in areas 
where an ancient trickle of water may have once carved a ravine 
in ages past.

Curve in the Pathway, Running South and East~
   The unglamorous dirt trail that is Harad Road winds its way 
east and south through South Ithilien, leading past the grassy 
hills that extend westward, and hilly land becomes the black 
mountains of Mordor to the east. The occasional patch of grass 
or brush grows along the road. The road snakes through a deep 
ravine at this point, it's walls consisting of loose gravel and 
rising steeply. 
   
   A gated barricade has been constructed, reachinng from wall to 
wall, its presence blocking any further travel.

Twisting Path Leading North and West~
   The dusty path of the Harad road continues north and west here 
through South Ithilien, little more than a narrow depression of 
land, as if once an ancient river ran along this course. To the 
east of the road, bleak hills and distant mountains rise up, 
while the western edge is bordered by hills that rise to a great 
plateau to the west. Long wagon ruts form the boundaries of this 
haphazard road.

A Steep Rocky Hill~
   The ground here is far from flat, rising in waves of hills and 
falls of valleys, spotted by the occasional gnarled tree that 
spurts forth from the ground and is accompanied by a clustering 
of bony bushes. The terrain gradually lifts from the long flat 
fields of South Ithilien westward, to the mighty, stark mountain 
face of the Ephel Duath which lie due east.

Underneath the Dismal Ephel Duath ~
   The stark range of the Ephel Duath roams from north to south 
here, this land a bumpy, rocky spit of land situated before the 
steep ascent of the mountains to the east and the softer, greener 
hillands of South Ithilien to the west. The only life to be seen 
here are the occasional flock of dark birds that make their homes 
in the craggy lips and caves visible on the surface of the dark 
mountains.

Weathered, Mountainous Ground Beneath a Plateau~
   Toweringly large evergreens climb high in to the sky here, 
nearly as high as the stalwart, rocky ledges of the northern Emyn 
Arnen that cast a noon shadow over this rocky slope. The craggy, 
weather-scored rocks of this slope rise and fall, but a clear 
descent down to the southern evergreen forest is present here. 
Etched in to the predominately stone ground here are innumerable 
little gullies that fill with water when rain descends from the 
sky above and the plateau of the Emyn Arnen.

one twisted trunk in a wood of otherwise unmarred straight 
slender trunks. An unpleasant scent is present near this one 
tree, adding to the oppressive atmosphere in the fog-darkened, 
heavy air beneath the tall evergreens. The marked silence of

foraging, nor birdsong, nor even the sound of insects. There is 
only the wood, and the fog.

   A grey fog lays still upon the woodland floor, stirring only 
with the passage of infrequent travelers. The light of the sun 
filters dimly through the scraggly tops of the evergreens, 
drawing white streaks through the shadowy mist below. The 
undergrowth is sparse, consisting of thin, reddish-brown grasses 
growing knee-high in the heavy shadowy air. The trees are quite 
tall, their thin trunks straight and dark, slick with moisture 
from the fog. No branches grow upon them except at the very top, 
and the trees grow closely together.

sections, growing knee high on an average man, round stalks 
fanning out at the top into cloudy arrays seeking in vain for

wood holds its breath. There is no sound of birdsong or any 
rustling of small animals about, nor even drone of insects.

heavy air beneath is laced with fog and silence; nothing stirs 
but that disturbed by the rare passerby. The sparse, red-brown 
grass grows in sickly patches underfoot, moisture glistening on 
the blades. Sunlight seems as if it is consciously held back by 
the fog and the branches above, pushing through in murky streaks.

Murky Woodland~
   Black, slender trunks covered with rough bark stretch far 
above the woodland floor, devoid of branches until the unruly, 
twisting, intertwined canopy of weak twigs and thin needles. The 
heavy air beneath is laced with fog and silence; nothing stirs 
but that disturbed by the rare passerby. The sparse, red-brown 
grass grows in sickly patches underfoot, moisture glistening on 
the blades. Sunlight seems as if it is consciously held back by 
the fog and the branches above, pushing through in murky streaks.

Eerie Shrouded Wood~
   The fog presses in upon the rare traveler who ventures here, 
weighted down with silence. Slender black trunks stretch up 
straight and tall, branchless until the very top, where weak 
twisted arms sparsely adorned with long thin needles crawl across 
the sky, inextricably intertwined with those of neighboring 
trees. The rough bark of the closely-spaced trees is slick with 
moisture, and reddish-brown patches of sparse grass struggle for 
survival on the shadowed floor of the wood.

Patchy, Scrub-Dotted Hills~
   Rolling hills extend in every direction, covered in thick 
grasses which range from two to four feet in height. The land 
has a wild, unconquered look to it and has so far fought off any 
attempts to cultivate it, though the local wildlife has worn 
narrow tracks which allow passage through the more thickly 
vegetated areas. The light brown earth is only visible in the 
steep sides of the deep graben that runs from the west to the 
north.

Tall Conifers in a Foggy Wood~
   The densely packed trunks of trees draw black vertical lines 
through a muted fog, their sparse top branches covered with long 
green needles. Red-brown grass covers the ground in thin patchy 
sections, growing knee high on an average man, round stalks 
fanning out at the top into cloudy arrays seeking in vain for 
sunlight. The air hangs heavy beneath the evergreens, as if the 
wood holds its breath. There is no sound of birdsong or any 
rustling of small animals about, nor even drone of insects.

A Foggy Evergreen Wood~
   A grey fog lays still upon the woodland floor, stirring only 
with the passage of infrequent travelers. The light of the sun 
filters dimly through the scraggly tops of the evergreens, 
drawing white streaks through the shadowy mist below. The 
undergrowth is sparse, consisting of thin, reddish-brown grasses 
growing knee-high in the heavy shadowy air. The trees are quite 
tall, their thin trunks straight and dark, slick with moisture 
from the fog. No branches grow upon them except at the very top, 
and the trees grow closely together.

   Here, natural forces of the earth have caused the collapse of 
many a grassy hill. A deep and wide graben runs like a gash in 
the earth from the cliffs of the Emyn Arnen to the northeast, 
wild grass covering the softly undulating ground on either side. 
The vegetation here resists the legs of the passing traveler just 
as the hills tax them.

Wet Heathland~
   A vast expanse of wet heathland stretches here, snaking in all
directions. The horizon is clearly visible here, the massive
mountains of the Emyn Muil and dark stretches of swamp and marsh
set before them. The earth is soft and wet, overrun with
low-lying scrubs and wet vegetation. Dead trees are littered
sparsely across the area, their blackened husks granting new life
to the bog. A web of algae stretches over the network of glassy
pools here, disappearing into a forest of reeds.

Narrow Path Leading South Into The Swamp And North Into The Mountains~
   In all directions the dark waters of the marsh lay still, the 
surface of the swamp broken by an occasional moss-marked tree and 
the twisting path of ground that cuts through the turgid mud and 
decrepit flora. Rough and uneven, the trail is formed of rock 
and raised earth, the edges quickly sloping down into thick mud 
and brackish waters. Leading from north to south, it passes by 
the forlorn nature of the marsh, allowing an unparalleled view of 
the marsh, the oppressive silence that hangs easily over it. 
   The mighty mountain range of the Emyn Muil lie to the north,
the northern border of the marsh as the outlying hills quickly
rise up from the dark depths.

Within a Brackish Bog~
   A vast expanse of wet heathland stretches here, snaking in all
directions. The horizon is clearly visible here, the massive
mountains of the Emyn Muil and dark stretches of swamp and marsh
set before them. The earth is soft and wet, overrun with
low-lying scrubs and wet vegetation. Dead trees are littered
sparsely across the area, their blackened husks granting new life
to the bog. A web of algae stretches over the network of glassy
pools here, disappearing into a forest of reeds.

Northern Ithilien Dry Lands~
   The landscape is dark and bleak, with only a few sparse 
patches of long-dead vegetation. Loose grey stones litter the 
ground, occasionally shifting in slides of tumbling rock. Rising 
to the east are the jagged outlines of stark black mountains. As 
far as the eye can see, the terrain is barren, descending 
slightly to the west.

Wind-Blasted Rock Underhill~
   Howling wind funnels down the notches and gaps in the
splintered peaks of the black mountains of Mordor that burst from
the ground to the east, a short run of increasingly rocky and
steep terrain rising up to them. Along with the wind comes the
smell of something old, a chill presence and the occasional fine
dust of soot.

Rising to the east are the jagged outlines of stark black

directly to the east and north.

North Ithilien Dry Plains~
   The land here rises and falls gracefully in a hilly landscape. 
Here and there grass grows and the occasional small shrub manages 
to poke through the mostly dry land. The odd tree has also 
managed to find a way to survive here and long gnarled roots 
extend out searching for more water. Few animals can be heard in 
this place and even fewer can be seen, the sound most prevalent 
being the wind.

Northern Ithilien Dry Lands~
   The land here is slightly cracked and broken the lack of 
moisture in the ground causing the landscape to crumble slightly. 
Grass grows here and small green and brown shrubs manage to find 
a place to grow. Trees can rarely be seen being few and far 
between, hidden by the rise and fall of the hills, despite this 
the occasional tree does appear.

Roily Mire~
   This depression of land in South Ithilien pools frequently 
with water, a number of tiny streams and rivulets filling with
muddy liquid with the movement of the tides, spilling forth to
drench the surrounding countryside. Past the boggy land, the
distant northern and eastern horizon are claimed by mountains
ranges, the former by the white cliffs of the Emyn Arnen, the
latter the black shards of the Ephel Duath. South and west, the
terrain continues to descend to a junction of rivers.

Eerie Shrouded Wood~
   The fog presses in upon the rare traveler who ventures here, 
weighted down with silence. Slender black trunks stretch up 
straight and tall, branchless until the very top, where weak 
twisted arms sparsely adorned with long thin needles crawl across 
the sky, inextricably intertwined with those of neighboring 
trees. The rough bark of the closely-spaced trees is slick with 
moisture, and reddish-brown patches of sparse grass struggle for 
survival on the shadowed floor of the wood.

Tall Conifers in a Foggy Wood~
   The densely packed trunks of trees draw black vertical lines 
through a muted fog, their sparse top branches covered with long 
green needles. Red-brown grass covers the ground in thin patchy 
sections, growing knee high on an average man, round stalks 
fanning out at the top into cloudy arrays seeking in vain for 
sunlight. The air hangs heavy beneath the evergreens, as if the 
wood holds its breath. There is no sound of birdsong or any 
rustling of small animals about, nor even drone of insects.

Murky Woodland~
   Black, slender trunks covered with rough bark stretch far 
above the woodland floor, devoid of branches until the unruly, 
twisting, intertwined canopy of weak twigs and thin needles. The 
heavy air beneath is laced with fog and silence; nothing stirs 
but that disturbed by the rare passerby. The sparse, red-brown 
grass grows in sickly patches underfoot, moisture glistening on 
the blades. Sunlight seems as if it is consciously held back by 
the fog and the branches above, pushing through in murky streaks.

not much water in the immediate area. Grass grows in patches 
mostly and small shrubs occasionally manage to find a perchance 
in the dry ground. Animals can rarely be heard or seen and the 
most obvious sound is the wind with few other sounds intruding up

   The imposing Mountains of Shadow rise from the land not far to 
the east, cutting off all hope of travel in that direction.

Northern Ithilien Dry Lands~
   This hilly landscape rises and falls quite gently, in places 
however the land has cracked and fallen creating small cliffs 
though none very large. Grasslands mostly fill the area though 
the grass is mostly patchy, dying shrubs of green and brown can 
be seen covering the ground. Few noises intrude upon the 
immediate area, animals avoiding the place. 
   The basaltic, near-vertical slopes of the Ephel Duath rise up 
directly to the east and south. A large, round boulder is set in 
the face of the mountain.

Sloped, Dry Plains Southwest of a Stream~
   Cutting a channel across the dry plains here is a fast-flowing 
stream that runs downhill to the northwest, originating from a 
waterfall over the high mountains to the east. The banks of the 
stream appear to support some more plant growth than the 
surrounding terrain, patches of pale green wildgrass and wiry 
scrubs sprouting up along the water's edge. The land continues 
sloping downward to the west, where a vast forest is visible.

   Knee-high, yellowish grass covers the land between a large 
forest to the southwest and a stream to the north. The ground is 
relatively firm underfoot, although the bank grows muddier as it 
nears the water's edge. Small birds take shelter in the grasses, 
darting in and out of delicate, hanging nests as they nip at 
passing insects. The stream's clear waters tumble downhill to 
the west with a loud, rushing noise.

Barren Hills of North Ithilien~
   Jagged gray and black rocks are everywhere; occasionally, 
loose sections of ground shift and tumble west, where the land 
slants downward. Looming to the east are huge mountains, looking 
just as desolate as the nearby terrain. There is no sign of 
plant or animal life. Scattered here and there are the cracked 
and desiccated remains of long-dead trees. 
   The flank of a mountain of the Ephel Duath rises up at a steep 
slope, hemming in the lands to the east.

High-Grass Lands About A Hillock~
   The ground underfoot here varies greatly as it stretches
across untold miles of the far northern Ithilien. From broken
puddles of muddy water to soggy soil, all punctured by the
occasional outcropping of dark rock, there is little in the way
to support easy travel across the heathland, yet alone
habitation. A steady silence hangs in the air, the uninhabited
bog set far from civilization, though the occasional rustling of
grass betrays the presence of some life.

the north and west. The immediate area is dotted with small, 
green and brown shrubs and a mixture of yellow and pale-green

A Grassy Stretch of Bog~
   Tufts of hard, brown grass and small, grey plants shoot out of
the soft ground of the north Ithilien, the roaming heath
seemingly abandoned by all things living. The occasional great
tree lays strangled by lichen, bowed down under the weight of
years, and on the occasionally hillock of hard land heaps of
rotted wood and stone can be seen. In all directions the bog
continues, distant mountains visible to the north and east, their
peaks capped with snow.

Sparse, Grassy Countryside~
   These lands appear to have been tended fields at one time, but 
they now show no signs of human inhabitation. Overgrown grasses 
and scraggly weeds cover the relatively flat ground, interspersed 
with an occasional twiggy bush. A large mound of rubble and ruin 
looms a short distance to the west atop a hill, while a wide road 
and dry hilly terrain is to the east.

   The terrain here is a wild, uninhabited land that spreads out 
to the west and south, a hard-packed dirt road hemming it in the 
other directions. Low hills spaced one after the other are 
covered by tall, straw-like grasses that bend and rustle in the 
wind. The land being relatively flat, one can get a good view of 
the surrounding countryside from atop one of these hills. A 
stone fortress juts out to the southwest, while a steep mountain 
range is within sight far to the east.

Sparse, Rocky Woodland Beneath Tall Cliffs~
   The sheer, chalk-white cliff walls of the Emyn Arnen jut out 
far above South Ithilien just a short distance to the north, and 
here the land descends rapidly as it heads south in a series of 
rocky, bumpy falls, headed straight in to a thin forest of 
spruces, cedars and firs. Amidst the rocky ground, the 
occasional knot of trees grows high in the chill, mountain air, 
as can be seen the odd large animal track.

Patchy, Scrub-Dotted Hills~
   Here, the ancient forces of wind and rain have caused the 
collapse of one side of a grassy hill. The wild, tough grasses 
of the area have yet to tame the resultant gash of earth that 
shows like a wound in an otherwise grassy sea. However, they 
have conquered the rest of the softly undulating ground here, and 
the vegetation resists the legs of the passing traveler just as 
the hills tax them.

In a Narrow Tunnel through the Mountains~
   Growing darker as the tunnel pierces the foreboding mountains 
of the Ephel Duath, its walls are crumbling and interwoven with 
spider webs. A rancid smell drifts through the tunnel and 
surrounding offshoots, all too small for the average humanoid.
Pieces of clothing lay strewn about the place, torn into shreds. 
Collections of ivory bones lie at intervals down the trail, set 
in triangular piles with a skull at their top. Footsteps are 
amplified in volume, echoing loudly down the forthcoming tunnels.

Descending Lofty Tunnel Through Jagged Caverns~
   The bone and clothing in this area seems to have become 
utilized in a somewhat more resolute fashion: small ivory shards 
and squares of blood-stained cloth have been wrapped around one 
another; torn; snapped; ripped, all in what seem like an attempt 
to either garishly decorate the area or as a deterrent to anyone 
who ventured into these rancid smelling passages through the 
mountain. The vast, towering caverns have tunnels snaking in a 
few directions, one in particular moving in a downward slope, 
opening out abruptly.

Crumbling Tunnel Deeper in the Ephel Duath Range~
   The tunnel snakes deeper into the dark rock of this mountain 
range, any sign of life now long gone. Footsteps echo deeply and 
reverberate throughout and off the cave's crumbling walls. A 
rancid smell wafts through the system of small rocky offshoots 
and various pieces of clothing have been torn and shredded at 
various points in the room, blood staining them a crusty maroon.

A Narrow Cave Snaking Southward~
   Narrowing considerably, this long stretch of cave is hewn 
primarily out of rock. Walls smooth and ground stained dark, 
there is a stale, malodorous scent lingering in the air, its 
source not immediately apparent. A long-decayed skeleton has 
been picked clean by time and various small creatures, the bones 
scattered in one rounded corner, not far from their companions. 
And most prominent on the wall, an ambling, brown trail has been 
traced as though words written onto the stone, marked by an old, 
dripping handprint and dipping crookedly from its starting point. 
Its edges have begun to flake away, time having had its way with 
the coherence.

In the Southern End of a Large Cavern~
   The rock walls of this large cavern are cracked and crumbling. 
The ceiling and walls are shored up by what was once thick, 
wooden beams now rotting and splintering apart. Puddles of murky 
water seep up from cracks in the rubble strewn floor. The air is 
dank and heavy. The smell of wet rock and rotting wood fills the 
air.

damp and cracking are shured up with rotting beams. The ceiling 
of the cave is colapsed at the rear while the remainder is 
supported by rotting beams. The air is damp and heavy with a

Murky Woodland~
   Black, slender trunks covered with rough bark stretch far 
above the woodland floor, devoid of branches until the unruly, 
twisting, intertwined canopy of weak twigs and thin needles. The 
heavy air beneath is laced with fog and silence; nothing stirs 
but that disturbed by the rare passerby. The sparse, red-brown 
grass grows in sickly patches underfoot, moisture glistening on 
the blades. Sunlight seems as if it is consciously held back by 
the fog and the branches above, pushing through in murky streaks.

A Foggy Evergreen Wood~
   A grey fog lays still upon the woodland floor, stirring only 
with the passage of infrequent travelers. The light of the sun 
filters dimly through the scraggly tops of the evergreens, 
drawing white streaks through the shadowy mist below. The 
undergrowth is sparse, consisting of thin, reddish-brown grasses 
growing knee-high in the heavy shadowy air. The trees are quite 
tall, their thin trunks straight and dark, slick with moisture 
from the fog. No branches grow upon them except at the very top, 
and the trees grow closely together.

Tree Bearing Fungus~
   Thick slabs of oozing disc-shaped fungus jut from the bark of 
one twisted trunk in a wood of otherwise unmarred straight 
slender trunks. An unpleasant scent is present near this one 
tree, adding to the oppressive atmosphere in the fog-darkened, 
heavy air beneath the tall evergreens. The marked silence of 
this wood is startling, for there is no rattling of small animals 
foraging, nor birdsong, nor even the sound of insects. There is 
only the wood, and the fog.

Boggy Lowlands~
   Small hillocks and short gullies rise and fall here in South
Ithilien, the overriding dampness of the land wearing away the 
areas of dirt and soil and leaving the occasional high peak of
flint or some other form of rock. The marshy ground lets nothing
grow upon it except low lying scrub bushes, and the occasional
colony of moss upon an ancient, felled shell of a dead tree. To
the south and west, the land grows moister as it approaches a 
pair of large rivers.

The Barren North Ithilien~
   The contours of the far Northern Ithilien roll up and down in
gentle curves, the small hills and gulleys created all of soft,
boggy land typical to the roaming heathland. Numerous small
bushes and dark grasses grow in a rampant, haphazard fashion
across the countryside, the large flora of trees strewn either
dead across puddles of muddy water or bent at strange angles.
Broadly sloping down from the horizon-set eastern mountains, a
dark stain of land crowds the north border of the bog.

Northern Ithilien Dry Lands~
   The ground is cracked and broken, and littered with loose dark 
gray rock that shifts and slides occasionally. To the east, 
huge, stark black mountains are visible; the land rises slightly 
as it approaches them. There is no sign of plant or animal life, 
only the long-dead skeletons of desiccated trees. Boulders dot 
the landscape, standing out amongst the smaller stones.

North Ithilien Dry Plains~
   The terrain is rocky, with very little vegetation and no sign 
of animal life. Boulders dot the landscape, and jagged, dark 
gray and black stones litter the ground, occasionally shifting in 
small, tumbling landslides. The mountains of Ephel Duath loom to 
the east, stark and black, with the ground rising sharply to meet 
them. 
To the north a road passing through the Morgul Vale can be seen.
While to the south there is the slippery banks of the Morgulduin.

Grasslands Bordering a Stream and Forest~
   Charred trees and bushes cover this incline, the vegetation 
blackened by a fire so ferocious that nothing seems to have grown 
back - no green tendrils amidst the results of some mighty 
conflagation, just ash and blackened husks and trunks. The 
ground is relatively firm underfoot, although the bank grows 
muddier as it nears the water's edge. The stream's clear waters 
tumble downhill to the west with a loud, rushing noise.

few tables. It is clearly a place for temporary visitors to rest
