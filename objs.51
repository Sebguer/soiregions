a severed head with pointed ears~
This head formerly belonged to an elf of unknown sex, the androgynous,  Fae qualities of their race making it impossible to distinguish.  Its flesh is a mottled grey, having been separated from its owner for some time.  Each eye is half open in a mockery of the life they once held and its mouth is agape enough to show a swollen, black tongue.  The hair is long, long enough to be tied to a warrior's belt as a trophy.

a fang-hilted steel shortsword with an iron core~
A fang-hilted steel shortsword made with an iron core lies here, forgotten.~
   This shortsword's hilt has been crafted from a single long 
fang, pure white in color and about a handsbreadth and a half. 
Its surface has been wound with black leather strips, wrapping 
around until it reaches the point, which is left naked to the 
world. Strips of bronze have been attached to the fang, 
reinforcing it and providing a stable support for the plain 
bronze crossguard. This curves inwards away from the blade, made 
of blued steel with an iron core. Carefully crafted, it extends 
out dangerously for several handspans. Both edges are incredibly 
sharp, ending in a point which curves lightly upwards and the 
steel has been imprinted with a wolf's head at its base.

buckles and leather straps allow the bracer to be strapped 
to one's forearms near the wrists, providing considerable 
protection. Upon the surface at the top of the forearm, 
the bracer bears a deep engraving of the tree of Gondor.

a brilliantly shining pair of steel plated sleeves~
A brilliantly shining pair of steel plated sleeves lay hear glinting in the ambient light.~
   Forged by the hands of a master, these sleeves are composed of 
steel and fashioned into the form of platemail. Bearing a high 
shine, they glint brilliantly in the presence of light and 
possess the air of being extremely durable against any form of 
attack. Bearing no form of mark or symbol, these sleeves are 
rather spartan, lacking all form of aesthetics, but they are 
absolutely superior at allowing the wearer a stout defense.

an emblazoned, teardrop shield of smoky steel~
An emblazoned, teardrop shield of smoky steel lays here awaiting its owner.~
   Made of the highest quality steel, this teardrop shaped shield 
was crafted by a masters hand. Its wider top tapers down to 
protect both the torso and the leading leg all at the same time 
while not obstructing the swing of a weapon. It is smaller and 
yet wider than the traditional example of this shield and would 
most likely be used by someone who is short and stout. 
Emblazoned upon its face is a greataxe splitting a large keg 
whose surface is etched with the word Aequitas in bold, runic 
lettering. The smoky quality of the steel tends to absorb light 
rather than reflect it.

body, eighteen inches from tip to tip, has been flattened on the 
top and rendered slightly concave to provide a dish-like 
indentation. Rendered with astonishing detail, hundreds of eyes 
glisten, reflecting the slightest light with baleful intensity.

an ornate winged-helm adorned with seabird etching~
An ornate winged-helm adorned with seabird etching sits here~
   The conical top of this helm comes to a gleaming point at the 
center. A long noseguard extends between rounded eye holes, and 
the cheek plates curve around so that they nearly meet. The 
forehead of the helm is carved in the likeness of a fierce, 
hook-beaked seabird. Two long wings, the midpoints of each 
fastened to the helmet near the temple, flank either side of the 
face, reaching several inches above the top of the helm. The 
etching of the seabird and the of feathers in the wings show 
meticulous attention to detail. The edge of the helm, around the 
bottom of the back, up around the cheek plate, and around the 
eyes down the nose guard is plated with gold in one long shining 
rope. The tips of the wings are also gold-plated. The helm 
shines, immaculate, with neither scratch nor effects of time 
evident, though it is of a style that seems ancient.

The corpse of a rugged, bearded man with unkempt hair has been laid out.~
   This is the corpse of a tall, statuesque man with unkempt 
short hair the color of raven's feathers. The pale, 
hearth-shaped face, covered with a thick black beard, shows signs 
of hard living, and the light torso is packed with lean muscle. 
The body has been cleaned and the wounds lovingly stitched 
closed. The fine steel chainmail has been polished and repaired. 
Over its shoulder is a fine, silver-chased black strap bearing a 
shortbow. A fine, gold-buckled black leather belt is about the 
waist, supporting a silvery green hip quiver and a black, 
silver-cased sheath. The black boots, well polished, are calf 
high, and bear silver buckles. At the throat is a crude leather 
brooch, and a black woolen overcoat is over all. The pale hands 
each bear a ring, one of simple ogld, one an elegant, vine-shaped 
golden ring set with a ruby. The hands are wrapped around the 
hilt of a sword.

an earthen brown scabbard embossed with the White Tree has been discarded here~
   Of sturdy construction, this wooden scabbard is covered in 
durable leather that has been dyed an earthen brown. Upon its 
outer face is proudly embossed the White Tree of Gondor, though 
it is left the color of the leather. The bottom tip is covered 
with another layer of thick leather, as is the rim of its mouth. 
Just under the rim, the leather is stamped with the image of a 
shield before a full moon.

Fashioned from a length or two of very simple wool, this cape

A heart beats rhythmically, its flesh blackened.~
   Except for being the color of a blackened bruise, this would 
seem to be the healthy heart of a large man. It sits in a pool 
of black, viscous liquid held by a platter shaped like a great 
spider. It looks to be, horrifyingly, shockingly, impossibly 
beating, drawing the foul-looking blood from the spider's legs 
and feeding it to the roots of the black, twisted tree.

Thick, unsanded wooden slats have been nailed firmly together

as wide. Small gaps exist between the slats, but they are still 
close enough to keep most items contained with ease. It seems 
more suited for heavy objects and looks as if it could take quite 
a bit of punishment. An area has been sanded smooth on the top 
slat for labeling. 
 
 
You realize that you could make use of this item with the 
following command: 
'label bin', in this manner: label bin "pots and pans".

coffin dormindle pine lumber DORMINDLE_FUNERAL_UNIQUE OTHER~
an enscribed finely made, pine lumbered coffin~
An enscribed finely made, pine lumbered coffin has been set here.~
   This coffin has been made out of a fine pine lumber, knots 
only interspersed here and there throughout the coffin. The wood 
remains an unstained, unfinished colour in its natural state, 
however it has been gone over with sandpaper, offering it a 
generally smooth appearance and feel. The top and bottom have 
been pressed together in a tongue and groove fashion allowing for 
only a slight seam to be able to be viewed to the curious 
onlooker, no nail holes visible upon it. The sides have been 
erected in much the same fashion, however nail heads can be seen 
where the sidewalls were mated to the bottom of the coffin.Having 
been adorned with a number of carvings, the lid wits loosely atop 
the base, awaiting the final nails to seal it. Along the bottom, 
a sun has been carved into the wood, forming the background for 
the word DORMINDLE to be raised in low relief from here. Within 
the proper light, the White Tree can be seen glinting in bronze, 
having been set into the wood by a large wire inlay that spans 
the entire coffin. To those who carefully investigate the 
coffin, a running wheat pattern has been carved into three sides 
of the coffin: two opposite sides and bottom, creating an image 
of chaff running along the border of the lid. Two rosettes in 
the spot where the sides meet the shoulders offer a transition to 
seven intertwined acanthus leaves that reach their way towards 
the head of the coffin. Here, five swords have been carved away, 
crossed in silent vigil very small atop the coffin. The while 
carving, while venturing towards the grand in its design, seems 
not have had a master hand turned to it. A few stray tool marks 
are visible here and there, yet the overall appearance is crisp 
and clean.

#5A mottled-grey frog hops around here.#0~
   This small creature is one of many of its species that call 
the marsh home. It is on a constant quest, searching out tasty 
small insects to slap out of the air with a long tongue. Loud 
and obnoxious, the constant croaks and other sounds leaving this 
amphibian make it a sore sight as well as a burden on the ears.
